344,15% tips sneaked into our bill even though we got crappy service and it wasnt busy at all (for obvious reasons)We had reservations before we came but they didnt remember anything and asked our information again then we decided to take the AYCE with 5 choices of meat but they were served little by little and they were not happy because we ordered a lot The water was free but they kept forgetting about it even after asking 3 times  If you ask for extra sides included they will reuse your old dish  Even its AYCE you only have one bulgogi which is the last dish because they dont want to change the grill  Now the worst part is that they gave me the bill after I already paid  she printed a new bill with 15% service fees then asked me to pay for it instead of the old one  Its so ridiculous because they didnt tell me in front or in the menu like other places  The food was OK but they did give me the Korean dip which I havent had in other places  Definitely wont come back ,?
2324,How bad could it be? I thought  After all  its close to home and in the winter Ill be wearing a hat so it doesnt have to be a perfect cut After I got home and showered  lets just say Ill be leaving my hat on permanently  Laura  I gave you a nice tip because its the holidays but please put in more effort on your customers or sharpen your skills  Needless to say I wont be coming back ,?
3217,Jordan is awesome! I have a lot of muscle tension which causes headaches and I always feel better when I leave ,?
3705,Micheals Arts and CraftsWell  they live under to the name! They have art and craft books  paint  brushes  art tools  so many different times of paper  if your an artist like I am  YOULL FIND ALL THE STUFF  My granny buys from their yarn section  she says the stuff if pretty great  Oh  and they often have discounts too  SO GO TO MICHEALS ,?
3959,Not a cadillac placeI see there is an online deal for this place  I was tempted to purchase that deal because this studio is so close to my home  Then I remembered how I emailed the studio a few months ago to set up sessions  I received one email from the owner but the conversation ended there  Mira Pilates didnt respond to any of my followup questions seeking specific dates and times  I was even willing/wishing to pay for private or semiprivate sessions! They lost my business then and I cant bring myself to try again  even with the seemingly good online deal  Beware ,?
4137,Old School Chinese food here   Im impressed with any lunch menu that emphasizes egg foo young (EFY)   In my opinion  EFY is a lost art of Chinese food  and their EFY is pretty good   Classic brown sauce  nice patty  nice texture  hot   A decent munch   The egg rolls are large and tasty too   A decent meal  a decent value   I can see the loyal reviews and I can understand the poor reviews   Comparing this place to PF Changs is not fair   This aint no corporatechowconglomerate  Its just an old school Chinese place   Get the Egg Foo Young!,?
4784,Stephanie Caldwell or whatever her real name is  is a sick  cruel  heartless individual  I have no idea how a person can be okay living a lie and stealing from others  She took our deposit and never answered us again  She claimed that she got a Flat tire on her way to our engagement photos then never answered us again  Thank goodness  this happened prior to our wedding day  After reading all of these terrible and similar situations  I am disgusted on how she can put people through this  I feel horrible for everyone thats been through this with her  She works under Wild Heart Photography  Picture this Photography AND That Wandering Light Photography,?
5125,The customer is always right  right??? NOT HERE!They argued with me on cutting my cuticles before doing a full set! DOES IT MATTER?!,?
5130,The doggshit cafe at Ballys this was the worst food i have ever had   Like because you are in Vegas they can pull that kind of shit     it was the worst way to end the best weekend ever  which is most likely why we got a seat in there right away    not one of four people finished their shit meal     sending biscuits and gravy back because they were stale  and hard as a damn rock ,?
6155,Why did you eat there? my stomach grumbled 20 minutes after walking away from Noobox I wanted Asian food  it was fast and the staff was pretty nice  I retorted while climbing a hill You idiot  Chinatown is right next door  I will ruin the rest of the day for you  my stomach gurgled And he did just that ,?
7833,$1 beers and $2 well drinks     What else can I say? I can imagine every casino before the 2000s being just like casino Royale  Only negative is the ventilation  pretty bad smoke smell but thats expected with one of the last old school casinos still left ,?
8055,$10 bloody Marys? No specials for game days? Lots of wasted space on patio  could have more seating and TVs  Slow service  Bad TV sound  Very pricey  Decent beer selection ,?
8469,$12 after tax and tip  The sandwich was really tasty and the Dutch bread was outstanding  both crispy and chewy  but I had a sour taste in my Christhole after spending so much for a sandwich ,?
8529,$12 for fried green tomatoes?!?!?! Ridiculous!!! The food isnt bad but the pricing needs to be adjusted  And the fried green tomatoes    way too heavily coated with corn meal  Could barely taste the tomato ,?
8604,$120 for pedicure and shellac maniare you kidding?? On top of that  two of the shellac nails peeled off within 3 days!!! Do not go here  And probably just getting off the strip if you can!,?
8764,$14 for this is just wrong  thought I was getting a chicken salad bowl like every other Mediterranean restaurant Ive ever been  Feel robbed,?
9635,$20 for 4 laundered/starched shirts and 2 dry cleaned/pressed trousers  And for a less than 24hour turnaround  thats a FANTASTIC deal  folks!,?
10024,$25 for a one nighter  $15 for resort fee  It was cheap  so we decided to stay here for Thursday night  Yes  it was off strip but it wasnt a far drive to get to the strip (5 min?)  We got a back strip view room (facing the Trump)  If you get  a strip view room  get the back strip because the front view has trains passing underneath it frequently  freeway traffic noise  It was so annoying we moved from front to back  Definitely much better!Rooms are all suites    a little outdated looking but works  Large bathroom  floor to ceiling windows  nice king bed  If they did a little modernization in the rooms  I think this would definitely be 4 stars!,?
10414,$3 50 for soda water off the gun?!  youve gotta be joking my ass  Also  it took twelve years for hot sauce ,?
10632,$32 for two beers and the pork belly nachos  Not worth it as the chips were greasy and the oil they were fried in tasted old  Plus it was for nachos and two beers! Could have had a steak somewhere for that price  Friend had the pretzel bites which were good  and another friend had wings and fries  Wings soggy for lack of better description and the fries came out cold  Three stars only because our server was good and they had some live music going on ,?
10985,$4 99 for 4 chicken strips  crispy fried juicy white meat with a sweet BBQ sauce and a big flaky biscuit!  Yeah!I promise to start eating healthier tomorrow   Uh  maybe?,?
11692,$5 99 deal is a great deal for a meal in Vegas plus the food was really good! First time I went it was myself and my pops and I we both had the French toast which was REALLY GOOD!!! with scramble eggs and sauage   no complaints for $5 99! SO the next morning I dragged myself out of bed and went back for another great breakfast but the only difference was the service was very poor which was crazy being I was there by myself there wasnt much for the waiter to do! I found myself waiting for a refill on Apple Juice that I desperately needed after a long night of drinking  for 26 mins(YES I COUNTED!  lol) then when I was done with my meal I was once again waiting  and waiting for my check   30mins! really?! It crossed my mind to just walk out but I didnt want jail time added to my story of my bachelor party trip! So all in all good food  decent prices but a hit or miss on customer service   ,?
12207,$7 for a glass of OJ? What a waste  the food was ok but it was really annoying that they wouldnt give me a glass of water but I could help myself to the cucumber water  Im sure a lot of people like it but to me thats just gross  I actually pulled my water bottle out of my car to drink there ,?
12406,$750 for glasses that will never fit right   You have to go in to get them adjusted every month   When you do its hit an miss  with only one thing that is certain: they get annoyed when you ask them to try again   Not going back    ,?
12487,$8 for the following;1/8 cup of gummies1 sucker ($1 here that are 10/$1 elsewhere)1 pack of pop rocks ($1 99) They took the fun out of fun candy shops :(,?
13032,The Nice Guys played tonight and did an amazing job! Wonderful live music and great food! Definitely coming back!,?
13227,((this review is only for the Clinque Counter))The last time I bought Clinque was when I was in high school and just for the gift with purchase  which is still pretty cool only a $25 purchase (usually just one item) The girl there (blonde  ponytail  sorry I forgot your name!) was super friendly and patient and a good sales lady  Not pushy  but helped me decide  I came there to buy a toner and mascara  but walked out with much more  She also gave me 2 Gifts (I guess  since I spent at least 4 times the minimum amount) and tons of gifts that I dont need to go back until the stuff I bought runs out ,?
13344,(10/11/17) Well there was an accident when I arrived home so there wasnt any power  so my wife didnt want to cook  So after thinking about all the different restaurants in the area we decided on Bamboo 7  When we got here it was empty and it was about as hot as it is outside  Apparently the AC was off but its back to getting comfortable in here  Ive ordered an egg roll and a bowl of white corn bisque  I also ordered orange beef  They are out of ginger ale so Im having sweet tea  My wife ordered egg drop soup fried tofu and some dumplings When the orange beef arrived it was finally at a hot & spicy level that I could enjoy  All attempts before this fell flat  It was nice that the spiciness didnt overwhelm the flavor of the dish  Everything else  the egg rolls  the soup & the service were right on target ,?
13445,(3 5 stars)I have been here a couple of times  once for lunch and once for drinks  For lunch I had their fish and chips  I was actually pretty impressed  I find that pubs are a hit or miss for fish and chips  Either there is too much batter and not enough fish  too greasy  over cooked  etc  However the batter was nice and light and the fish tasted fresh  Their fries were nice and crispy too  It was a huge portion  2 pieces of fish  I had to take half of it to go because I couldnt finish it all in one sitting  They have a nice rooftop patio as well  which is nice in the summer time ,?
13729,(BED BUGS!!) Well Id like to say it was worth it for the price:   but no it was uncleanly and the staff didnt seem to react when I showed them a bedbug that was in my room!! Never staying there again,?
15692,** I did not stay at this hotel  but this review is for the Casino part only  **Great atmosphere  you can find good $ amounts for the table games  Many $5 or $10 tables   I was really thristy since it was over 100 degrees outside   The bar made me an Iced Tea       which I was very appreciative of   Very casual atmosphere and they played great music in the background  Prime location for a casino   Definitely a place to hit while casino hopping!,?
16178,*** This rating is based solely on the nightclub   didnt get a chance to try any of the food***Came in late Saturday/early Sunday with a bachelor party group  and the place was going off! Everyone having a good time  great music from the DJ  and just a good overall vibe  Didnt have to wait hardly at all in line  but by the time we left around midnight  the line was about 5075 people deep Will definitely make it down here again next time Im in Scottsdale!,?
17068,****Best salsa in Vegas **** Excellent smoky flavor and very fresh  The rest was standard (good) fare  Reasonably priced  a good option if youre coming from Nellis  Ive been on a tour of the taco joints over the last few months  and this ones up there ,?
17308,****update****My gums are finally super healthy! I have been getting regular cleanings at this place and every time they make sure to do all the needed checkups and exams to keep me healthy  Angela is super swift and efficient  and Dr  Quinn is super skilled and I feel like she is really genuine  She told me I have very good teeth and dont need anything done at all  Its nice to see you can count on a professional to be upfront with you and not just out there to make a quick buck   I recently had my cleaning done here by the hygienist Angela  she came highly recommended by Dr  Quinn  The cleaning was amazing and pain free!Everyone here is so friendly and approachable ,?
18348,***This small and upscale shopping mall looks nice  but there is not much to it; the shops here are mostly upscale and niche; the most interesting thing about this mall (to this outoftowner) was that it housed one of Michael Symons B Spot (burger) locations***This shopping mall has its own free parking lot; the parking lot is not that big though and it can be difficult finding an open spot ,?
18515,***Update***its been 4 days since I had my nail fixed and it chipped yesterday & has a tear   Not to mention  the guy argued with me that it wasnt the same color   he said it looks different because the other nails are old and this one is new   After a few days  it is definitely the wrong color!  Jerk!  This place is  GARBAGE !!  I wont be going there for pedis anymore either   Ill never spend another dime at 7 Day Sweatshop & Nails ,?
18556,***WARNING SPORTS FANS***DO NOT SHOP HERE!! I went to purchase a plastic Kansas City Chiefs license plate  the guy wanted $15 00!   R E A L L Y? I said are you kidding me? He was rude with an accent from the Middle East  not that it matters  just giving you a heads up for who the rude guy was  I told him Never will u get my money! RIP OFF! So I went to Just Sportz only paid $6 99 ,?
21955,*This review is for the brunch menu*I really like this place for a nice boozy weekend brunch   They have a nice terrasse in the summer  You can bring your own wine and buy orange juice to make mimosas  The baguette option instead of the usual square bread is great  especially if you get an Old Cheddar cheese extra to eat it with  Their crepes are also reaaally good  Try it out  you will not be disappointed!,?
22695,*update August 30  2016*Customer service came through with the correction refund   This is well received and Im thankful for the last person I worked with to understand the situation and resolve but it did take some time and work to get to this person   Im not thrilled with that process and he pain to get to that point but its resolved *update August 17  2016*Thank you for the message   I have already had multiple calls with you organization and sent multiple emails without anyone addressing the issues and certainly no positive results for my situation  but I will try one more time as youve asked   At this point I do feel like Im wasting my time   If we can resolve then Im happy to adjust my comments Beware   Poor service  very expensive for what they offer and equipment is weak at best   Go with a company with better technology and customer service for the same price or less   Dont waist your time ,?
22934, nice location right off the strip free valet parking services  very friendly hotel staff~ if youre using the suite  make sure to request extra blanket for whoever uses the sofa bed~ the normal temperature is pretty cold so keep that in mind when adjusting the thermostat,?
23759, Open til late   Allow smokingBeen here a couple times  One time I ordered a fish fillet on rice for a little under $10 and got 5 thin pieces of fish fillet and a full large chinese takeout box of rice ,?
24312, Lobby stinks of smoke and has no other attraction Housekeeping sucked because despite a DND sign  they kept knocking every 45mnts or so! Room service took forever Bathroom was not actually Westinbig and the shower tub was actually quite annoying because the stopper kept closing itself shut due to the force of the water   Overall the place is old and shabby  not maintained too well  All in all  not a great deal  not a great place  and not recommended really ,?
24534,3 5 starsMy first time at a Gordon Ramsey establishment  In all fairness  I was overly excited for this opportunity owing to the fact that I have been watching Ramsey on a number of TV programs for some time  and he is hands down my favorite celebrity chef  That being said  I was a bit disappointed that after an hour long wait for a table  it took another ten minutes after being seated to even be approached by a waitress  upon which we finally received water and a drink menu  I had the scotch egg appetizer and the mussels and clams  both of which I thought were delicious  I was surprised by the heftiness of the mussel plate   Im guessing there was at least 2 lbs  of shellfish on there  Overall  good pub food  but service needs a bit of work ,?
24577,The fees are no good  When I got married how is it when I changed my name with 5 credit cards it was no big deal  they sent me a new card in the mail for free  Credit One charges you if you want a new card with your new name on it  They also ask for a arm and a leg to show proof that you got married and changed your name  You have to mail it out too The operators are also not helpful  You have to keep your fingers crossed every time you need to call to get a good knowledgeable operator that you can understand The website is awesome   thats pretty much the only good thing about this company ,?
24901,Extremely crowded horrible service dirty bathrooms overpriced alcohol overpriced foodcover $6/person Went there with friends  Firstly  they charged cover of $6 per person  This was on a Friday 6pm  Extremely crowded and loud  You have to find your own table  Food and alcohol was overpriced  Our waitress was snippy and slow  Took her half an hour to get our bills  Dont recommend at all ,?
25072,No FUNKY secondhand clothing smells here! The stuff looked pretty new too  surprisingly Prices were pretty decent  although I didnt find anything Merchandise was easy to look through  not too crowded at all I saw several people coming in the store with arm loads of clothing from their closet  so this must be a pretty good place for your unwanted duds Parking was convenient Next door to WellSuited Mens clothing This is what a multimillion dollar revenue retail business looks like (per newspaper article 11/14/10)  Impressive ,?
25316,came here on a friday nightcool venue (three bar areas/band area/outdoor area upstairs & downstairs  and and upstairs area for reserved bottle servicemy favorite part was watching the cover bands: Rock lobster and another one i forgot the name ofthe have a hot dog vender: decent prices: order the polish sausage!,?
27083,0 starts if I could  My daughter (2year old) and I came in today and  she wasnt tall enough for any rides  I didnt know that and they didnt tell me she couldnt ride anything when i purchased the wrist band When i went back they said they couldnt give me my money back because we had been there for more that 10min  (looking for rides to take my daughter on) point is they robbed me of her money & i was speaking to a manager horrible management   Never coming here again   UPDAT,?
27281,02/27/2012 Well we returned to Qs Diner with a party of 9 Here is the break down We ordered fried pickles as a appetizer  Verdict  Best we have ever had!!!! The highlight of the meal was the bacon wrapped meatloaf with fresh homemade mashed potatoes covered in gravy with a side of pinto beans  well what can I say I have found a meatloaf that I like better than the Cheesecake factory   It just rocks!My wife had the shrimp and grits again and thought it was wonderful My friend Brian also had the meatloaf but with collard greens  None was left and he commented that the collard greens was the best he ad ever had His wife Paula had chicken pot pie  She said that it tasted great but she wished the sauce had been thicker The other members of our party were children  3 of the 5 had chicken fingers with no complaints One of the children had a fried green tomato and lettuces sandwich and loved it  The last child had a vegetable plate ,?
27414,05/01/2014  I was on the market for a new vehicle for months  I was turned down by other dealerships because I didnt have any credit or thousands of dollars for a down payment   I came to Priced Right Auto and I test drove a few cars   I finally picked one out and Pablo Coria (The KING of CREDIT) took my information to submit over to his banks for approval   It took a few hours but when I received a call he had GREAT NEWS!!! I was approved with a small down payment and NOT a 20% interest rate!!!   Now it has been a few months now and I dont have any  buyer remorse   Thank you guys at Right Priced Auto!!!,?
27655,09/28 @5pm horrible customer service   3 employees standing around not one asked can I help you? Ill take my money next door instead ,?
27944,1 hour and half  to exit from parking lots!!! Unbelievable!!! The worst experience ever !!!,?
28267,1 star for 1/2 priced wine sundays     The rest was just ok   I am still trying to find a local place to eat a bowl of good  good pasta and drink some wine ,?
30418,1/2 cuz the room had a fridge   lol  we check in  they give us directions to our room  its not in the same building  they send us back to our car  then we had to drive to the Manor rooms  theyre these shitty rooms that are NOT connected to the casino  5 minute walk     in 3 story buildings that look like motel 6s  but MORE ghetto5 stars for kids tho!!!   most amazing arcade ive ever seen  if i were still a kid  i would have gone nuts!! however  im not a kid anymore : /stayed with family on this last trip  wow  never do that again  i would much rather pay double triple  or quad for any other 3  4 star hotel in vegas,?
30758,10 minutes in the store to get a watch battery and probably some of the best customer service Ive ever come across its all the way across town for me but Im coming back to upgrade my wifes wedding ring to a 4 karot these were easy some of the nicest individuals Ive ever come across Las Vegas,?
30916,10 stars if I could!!! I love love love this place! The ice cream is amazing ! The flourless cookies are the best  Everytime I come here I am on cloud 9  This place is amazing I highly recommend coming here  Even if its just for a snack  The clock in the middle sometimes has chocolates come out of it  All of the food here is amazing  Its a super cute place and there is a Payard express that you can pick up things on the go  There are also a good selection of togo treats  This is my all time favourite place ,?
31339,10/10 would go again  Had boat shoes resoled and new heels put on my boots  They look brand new!,?
31388,10/10! Great staff  very comfortable atmosphere  delicious coffee  Could use some vegan treats of some sort  but its a cafe  not a bakery ,?
31659,100 percent the best  from Ashley our server to the corned beef  and cabbage  I wish I would have gotten the potato pancake with it  the lady next to us said it was devine! Im diabetic and made a good choice  my 11 year old was with me  and she ate most of my corned beef  I had some of her pot pie  the flaky crust yum yum yum  fun place  fairly quiet on a Saturday but it was only around 6 pm  I have been here before when at the Hotel San Carlos  and we will be back! Yay for  For Seamus! yay yea YAY!,?
33373,15 min for bean burrito from the express window  No one else in line  Blank looks from the two employees behind the register as the staff in the back stood around and chatted  (They were visible through the window ) Finally got my meal but it was bland and barely warm  Only ate it because it was $14 already spent ,?
33895,19 95 all you can eat! Friendly service thats close to home is always welcome ,?
33938,1926 & still going strong  Not sure how we lucked into just a 5 minute wait for a group of 8 but we did thanks to the waiters rearranging a few people  Just do yourself a favour & order the medium melt in your mouth! Perfectlypuckering pickles cut the richness of the meat  Portions are reasonable you wont leave hungry but they arent obscene either Cherry cola to wash it all down and youre good to go ,?
34162,1st Clue: All the restaurants/bars were pretty packed except here  Waitress was ok until you told her that some of our food REALLY sucked  then she didnt bat an eyelash  If 3/4 of your party says the food sucked  then it sucks!!! Hey tried it  now I know  The town street is happening here awesome weekday/night life but just not here!,?
34386,1st i love circle k but this is the very worst location Ive ever visited  I wouldnt post a review except Ive been here multiple times and every time its worse  They are understaffed only one cashier ever and lines out the doors other employees doing nothing but watching as customers waiting way to long to purchase anything  They are always out of the fountain drinks  At one point i tried to fill my cup with three different drinks and after each one they were all bad ,?
34534,1st off service is amazing! Theres never a time when youre not with a waiter or waitress  The quality of the meat was really great and very tasty  They are very innovative with their grill  The prices were pretty decent for Korean bbq  Thanks for the great food & awesome service!!!!,?
35237,1st time here and will definitely be returning  I had a lechera crepe topped with strawberries and sweet peaches along with a caramel machiatto  Thumbs up to both! A great balance of flavors without overwhelmingly sweet  The machiatto was better than Starbucks! And the prices/portion were perfect for a Sunday afternoon  Great  friendly atmosphere to add  All in all  nothing negative to say ,?
36125,1st visit and it was great!! Got me in as a new patient the very next day with a cleaning and visit with the Dr    very friendly and minimal paperwork to fill out   Called me in as I signed the last form  no waiting at all   Best Dentist office ever!,?
36131,1st visit and the waiter recommended the Big Dipper  I was satisfied  Didnt care for the assorted fries  Too crunchy/over fried for my taste  Prices are high due to its location  but I would go back and try something else ,?
36293,1st way to over priced for what it is2nd the burger I got was so salty I couldnt stand it  And the beer was way overpriced  Not coming back ,?
36695,2 cashiers taking care of the 1 customer ahead of me  Theyve been chatting for at least 5 minutes now  completely ignoring me  Wow ,?
37462,2 stars because I feel bad and the price is low  Coming from areas in the country where I paid $3 a donut  this was a steal However you cant argue with quality  Multiple of our dozen donuts were undercooked and frankly just gross Threw the majority of them away,?
38051,2 stars only because I enjoyed the cheesecake   waitress was rude to us  Our food was so bland  Just a huge bowl of noodles no flavor   I will never come back for dinner I however may consider cheesecake,?
38521,2 words  THE BEST! I seriously crave these wings like no other! I think about them ptetty much on the daily  Its probably good i dont live closer because i would be here way to often  I think the price is great  The staff is always friendly  I Really enjoyed chatting with the manager today very great crew ,?
39854,2 5 stars: 2 hours for a detail and no wifi :(,?
40554,20 year old house I just bought; doubt it had been cleaned before   No heavy staining or mildew  just surface dirt   After they finished there was still a lot of discoloration on garage doors and north side of house that I could easily rub off with a light cleaner   They were not onsite very long as there is a lot of brick  but even so it is obvious they rushed through it   Ill be redoing it myself this weekend ,?
42083,2nd Best Indian restaurant in the Charlotte area (only after its sister restaurant in Ballantyne (Blue Taj)   Can be crowded and quite pricey but overall an amazing choice ,?
42437,2nd time at an El Pollo loco  2nd time I got sick  (Different locations  too)DONT go here ,?
42470,2nd time at this restaurant at this location   Awesome  amazing  OMG I wanna eat here every week!Pricey  but its Vegas and it is damn good food and worth every penny    excellent ambiance  waiters are very nice and friendly  you basically develop a relationship with them   Mini Kobe sliders  lobster bisque with shrimp rice krispies!!!!  truffle fries  green beans (even my hubby who does not like greens  ate all the greens!)   excellent fish  and of course amazing steaks/filets   enjoy to the max!!Bread pudding for dessert   if you still have space in your tummy   go for it!!I need to find a reason now to go to LA or NY so I can go to an STK at those locations    ,?
43189,2nd trip here  Really like the food  dont care for the kinda     cafeteria like atmosphere? It may just be me  but the food is great The duck liver mousse deal is still as good as I remembered  Started with quail and foie ( I cannot express in words how good this was) the popovers  bread lover here  thank you! Rib eye perfect and creamed spinach  Cocktails are tasty and really liked our server truthfully the quail/foil and our server made it 4 stars  otherwise would give it 3,?
43274,2nd visit in a week and this time was worse  A week ago this place was packed  It took over 20 minutes to be seated and we waited over 30 minutes after ordering before being served  This last visit we waited 30 minutes to be seated and almost an hour AFTER ORDERING to get our food  We asked for the manager and 15 minutes later the manager came over to our table  Looking absolutely beaten down to a pulp he said the kitchen was over worked and they couldnt keep up with the busy orders  THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE for a large well established restaurant with multiple locations  While the food was just average the entire menu seems somewhat overpriced for what you get  Not the only choice around the area and its time to give our business to other places  Maybe  had the manager taken care of our meals  or offered another round on the house we might consider another visit  Doubt we will return to The Rio If your in the mood for Mexican food try another establishment ,?
43486,3 1/2 ** Service was good  waitress was very nice to my 1 year old son  The bbq sauces are delicious  food wasnt bad  Had pulled pork and threw on the yummy sauce which made it that much better  Hoping to see their sauces bottled   I would buy  Would return ,?
44185,3 for location  otherwise its spot on for the Casatta cake  see my daughter loves Cassata but one makes it how she likes it  with real strawberries and the such  If it wasnt for location you would definitely be a 4  Not many get 5  im a tough customer  I worked a lot in the industry  thats why im so tough when criticizing my choices of sustenance  So  A1 for making my daughter happy for her birthday every year now for the past 3 or so years ,?
44409,3 of us ate a great dinner here  Authentic food  delicious   friendly owner   good prices  Full bar   We loved it ,?
45673,3 stars  nothing spectacular  Music is soso  I cant even find much to write   Ive been twice and that was enough for me ,?
45868,3 times at J and J three winners  First time June pedestrian Sunday was sausages the mac and cheese sausage OMG  Second time July pedestrian Sunday White trash taco Beauty and today pulled pork sandwich another winner thank you  James Miller,?
46229,3Great selection and atmosphere  Portions are a bit small and prices are a bit high  But the food is very flavorful  I really enjoyed everything here  The services was good too and the staff is very helpful in making decisions Oh and they have little goals in the urinals which are fun ,?
47404,3 5 Stars  Decent service although a bit slow  good food  but semisteep prices  The Orange Tables kind of weird to me  It seems like a hip little dinery type place  but its tucked into this sort of business parklooking building next to a couple of other bars and restaurants  The interior is out of a college handbook  Bright colors  cool vibe  with a coffeehousey type feel to it  Theyve got a full menu and a full bar as well  which makes this place that dream diner that most 20somethings long for  I dont quite remember what their coffee is like  but along the lines of beer  theyve got a pretty decent selection of craft brews  Ive only been here for lunch and dinner  so I cant speak for their breakfast menu  Theyve got good burgers and a very gooey and comforting grilled cheese nothing really that out of the ordinary  but solid  nonpretentious  greasy comfort food in Scottsdale is always welcome by me ,?
47969,3 5 starsEven at 8 pm Saturday  this place is packed and there was a constant stream of people just picking up drinks   I would say that drinks here are your standard fare here BUT it does have the Clover machine with the Reserve beans   If you want a good coffee and dont mind paying a really high price for it  that would be a decent option (if you dont want to do Indy    there are 2 Independents within a 2 minute walk that are very good) The store is kept clean & has a ton of seating   In addition to your usual bar seating facing the window  they have an upstairs with a few tables as well   Staff here is uncharacteristically friendly    they were all in talking about the different seasonal favourite drinks & ways to customize   Nice  clean  & convenient location with decent staff    cant ask for much more from Starbucks ,?
48855,3 5 stars for the completely interesting experience  We came Saturday night around 9pm  and there was only one big group there celebrating a birthday  There was a DJ lady playing Youtube videos (by request) and occasionally singing  And top it all off with a parquet dance floor with disco ball for the big groups kids to jump around singing and dancing to LMFAO  We noted that it felt like we were at a 1990s prom  Amazing The food was fine  The Thai tea is only $2 but was extremely sweet (like 2x a normal Thai tea)  The pork pad see ew was decent  but not particularly flavorful or salty and saucy enough  I did really enjoy the Yum Nur Nam Tok though  which is grilled strips of beef  mint leaves  red onion  green onion  ground rice  and spicy sauce  This seems to be a latenight place  The restaurant started filling up more around 10pm ,?
48941,3 5 stars is a more fair rating    but Ill start here and try them again in a while  Over all everything was reasonably good  but it seemed odd that a place called pies for breakfast only had 3 types of pies to choose from My wife and my son in law got the pancakes  I had the omelette with asparagus  It was all prepared well  and came out in a reasonable time  especially for as busy as they were The portions are sensible  not large   although all the sides are extra  Which I guess makes it a little on the expensive side for what it is  If Pies is in you name  a few more pies to choose from would be in order    they have just been open a few weeks  Ill check back in a few months and see how they adjust ,?
49923,3 5 stars  Came here with no expectations but surprisingly the food are good  The only problem is no place for jackets  there are only a few coat hangers ,?
50559,3 5* I went with two of my friends a couple months ago and we were quickly seated  We ordered bento boxes so I cannot comment on the AYCE service but we received our bento boxes fairly quickly  The server was an older lady and she was sweet  We were given side dishes and we all loved the peanut one that was both sweet  salty and a bit spicy  The bento boxes were average  nothing exciting  I thought prices were a bit high but not overly expensive  I would come back here again ,?
50610,3 5* rounded up because all service here  from hostesses to bussers  waitresses  sushi  and teppan chefs are so genuinely friendly and welcoming  Its literally around the block  and we couldnt be happier  My SILs are all about the Happy Hour specials  which are quite good  Im more of a sashimi and occasional nigiri kinda gal  so I usually offer a la carte from the special board  The lunch specials are reasonably priced  and service easily gets you in and out quickly enough to cover a break  Fish quality is good to excellent on some of the specials  they dont have uni or live items  but high grade fish is available  Rolls seem to please the yum yum sauce crowd  too  They have Teppan tables which have to be reserved  and we are definitely going to try that soon  Scott loves it! Yelp check in yields free edamame  The joint seems to be jumping nightly  and we are jazzed to have them in the hood ,?
50694,3 5  if you are ever in Mississauga area  you should give this place a try! Its quite small  would recommend making reservations  I love how when we are seated they give us a refreshing shotvery different! Our server was great  and recommend all our dishes other than the butter chicken we always tend to get  We first started with the mixed skewers for apps  shrimp  salmon  chicken etc with diff types of sauces  It wasnt on the menu  server just put together based on the amount of people we had  We really enjoyed it as there is a variety of flavours mint curry  etc  Also it came with different toppings and sauces  As for mains there is A LOT of options from different parts of India  very confusing at first hence we had the sever recommend for us  Overall I thought the main dishes were OK  nothing stood out like the appetizer  Sauces were however flavourful and the garlic naan was awesome!,?
50892,3 5/4 starsThis is a nice place to stay and for a reasonable price too I deducted a star due to:1  A terrible view  I kept the curtains drawn because my view was of dumpsters and a filthy alley 2  Random constructionlike sounds  Around 7AM  rather loud and disruptive banging and thumping would commense  Im not sure why or where as I didnt notice any obvious construction The room was comfortable  I found the toiletries they provided to be top notch too  I ordered room service on two occasions and was pleased with the service and the food The service in particular was stellar  Two big thumbs up to Kaela  She was extremely friendly and helpful The restaurant was tasty food  but nothing spectacular Its in s convenient location too ,?
53149,4 STARS  Good beer  Very good food  These guys do ribs and burgers in awesome ways  The tacos were a big bad do not order  they have a cheesy jalepeno mix  and did not taste real at all  I sent them back  The owner says they have cheddar  Ask for cheddar! The service is prompt and polite  They have real music on the night I dropped in  It was firstclass  The patio is also a bonus  I would consider coming back  People were lively and happy here  Honestly ,?
53411,4 flights delayed today at the airport and this place is running out of chicken and turkey which is mostly all of there sandwiches    Unreal   This has happened numerous times ! Dont bother!,?
53655,4 of us had drinks  apps  entrees  & dessert and it was all fantastic! Sat at a bar table so we could keep an eye on the Cavs game  The waitress was friendly & efficient  one of the owners went table to table checking on things  & best of all? Great  Seafood  I rate a lot based on raw oysters & they are top notch here  ordered chilled raw  as well as grilled (1st time for that!) & both were perfect texture with excellent flavor & accompanied by proper accoutrements  Entrees at the table were from the fresh catch list: perch  walleye  & swordfish  along with a Newburg that was loaded with hunks of good stuff! 2 opposing desserts were perfect together: key lime pie & dark chocolate layer cake  Great ending to a great meal for all of us  See ya again soon!,?
53760,4 out of 11 teller stations open  A solid 45 minute wait  No real sense of urgency  I had to choose one star to have the ability to post this review ,?
54252,4 stars for 1/2 price sushi on Wednesdays and Thursdays! Nothing incredibly inventive here  Basic sushi and good hibachi  if you choose to sit at one of the cookinfrontofyou tables  Not super accommodating of special sushi requests  but that couldve just been the waitress  Overall the rolls were good for a great price  The sushi rice wasnt mushy (a huge pet peeve)  And the service was efficient  Dont come here for ambience  but if you need a cheap sushi fix  this should do it ,?
54958,4 stars for what it is  cheap pizza  And cheap pizza is good pizza  And this is some of the best cheap pizza Ive had around the university area  Im down here a few times a month  whenever I dont have a full hour for lunch  The line moves pretty fast  even in the middle of the lunch rush  and theres a pretty good selection  For vegetarians  there are usually at least 3 or 4 veggie options other than just plain cheese  but not right when they open at eleven Eating inside can be fine or annoying depending what theyre playing on the TV  which varies quite a bit  anything from Spike TVs MXC (hilarious) to Barney (extremely disturbing  seriously  have you ever sat and watched one of these shows? Some freakydeaky shit!!) and everything in between ,?
55652,4 0 stars for the Burger and Bar special  We walked in around 1pm on a Friday while attending a convention onsite at the Riviera   The server came over immediately    Took our order   We waited awhile for our order but she checked on us every so often It was worth the wait $10 00 got us a juicy cheeseburger  fries  and a 16oz draft beer ,?
56405,4 5 stars (but you cant do that so five)  Every employee We talked to was super helpful and pleasant  Took the staff elevator due to heavy conference intake  Staff service just exceeded all expectations and everything was enjoyable  No issues and great location ,?
56417,4 5 stars  because of their bomb DESSERTS ! Omg theyre to die for thats why Im starting the review with them   We had the vegan brownie sundae       I couldve died happy   I couldnt believe it wasnt a normal brownie or ice cream with milk   The brownie was made from black beans     Some sort of sorcery going on in that kitchen but I dont mind   We also had the blueberry cheesecake which was good   it couldve came out colder to make it taste more like cheesecake   For the meal we all split the meatball sandwich   vodka mushroom penne   and mushroom pizza   All of it was really good   The meatballs really tasted like meatballs but its mostly plant based   For starters we tried the sushi roll with wild rice   It was my first time having wild rice   it tastes good   The sushi roll was refreshing with the crunchy vegetables inside   All in all I was impressed with this place and will be back (:,?
58073,45 minute wait just to get eyebrows done because they only have 1 employee working and shes threading and checking out  They should at least have 2 on staff at all times ,?
58082,45 minute wait to get seated  The brisket was good but I expected it to be better  in fact the casino buffet 2 blocks down has a comparable brisket  The pork ribs with the dry rub had a decent flavor but were severely undercooked  Michael Symon has been quoted as saying ribs should have some chew to them  I dont think he meant not being able to get the meat away from the bone  Ribs 101 is the bones poking through the top is the indication of them being cooked   If you refer to my picture you will not see a bone in site  I would think a guy that hosts a show on barbecue would know how to cook a decent rib  The Cracklins just tasted like butter for some reason  There was no salt or seasoning on them that I could tellThere are better options around town so your better off skipping Mables  Oh and a disappointing meal for 2 cost a little over $70  Clevelands second favorite son disappoints with its one ,?
58331,4th time at Prestons in 2 years and wont return   Need to wait until Im 55  Service was great!!!! Apps were mediocre at best   Rather go to Mastros ,?
59096,5 Stars!I love this place!This place is on my list when my expectations are high and my appetite seeks to be satisfied for an nice Italian dinner  Love the food!Love the people!Love the atmosphere!and         I just love the Chef!What is the Chefs secret ingredient? According to the servers  the Chefs secret ingredient in preparing his signature dishes is       cooking with      LOVE !!That explains is all         why I leave IL Chianti as a more loving person!Thank you Mr  Chef Janeo  for your warm welcoming smiles  your dishes that feed the heart as well as our tummies  and your inspiring reminder to live in the moment of enjoying your restaurant with food  family  friends  & fun ,?
59947,5 star location for sure! Im a frequent visitor to the area and absolutely loved their outdoor seating with the glorious misters keeping things cool  They have a large patio with a bar on the inside and outside and a fireplace for the cooler evenings  As first timers its a little bit odd  Luckily a lot of people seem confused when they walk in and the staff does a good job of finding us and bringing us a menu  huddling us up and giving us the scoop while we stand by the door  Note: you order up front and they bring everything after though its not obvious when you walk in  Food was pretty good  I had a bun less burger with guacamole and loved every bite  Once seated  the waitstaff brings you refills on drinks from the bar and constantly checks up  We had a great time hanging out and chatting  Happy Hour runs to 6pm  With tips  3 drinks a piece and entrees for all 5 we were under $150  Will definitely be back ,?
60359,5 stars all around  minus the price  But thats what you have to pay for sushigrade raw fish! And you get a generous serving of the protein! I had just come back from Hawaii and was missing poke so Pokito was on my hitlist  I had sampled Pokito at a food event before the store opened  and judging from the prices then  I knew it would be expensive  I had the creamy spicy salmon today and I loved the choice of toppings that you get to choose from  Hot tip: dont make it into a burrito  Poke is meant to be eaten in toppingsonrice format  Sushi burritos are messy anyway and youll probably end up getting most of it on yourself ,?
61285,5 stars for fast service and cool walk up window to pick up mobile orders or place them there   Covered patio us a nice touch when its not 100 degrees ,?
62223,5 stars for the staff    Lazy River   eh   just so so (short)    Rooms are really ugly   nothing goes together  way to much going on   not relaxing at all  The lobby was beautifully done  nothing like the rest of this southwest 1980s Hotel ,?
63296,5 starts isnt enough for Danielle and her business! She has always done the best job on my hair and I always leave happy! She is frendly  and outgoing  I know I will always leave happy after taking a visit to her  I would not only recommend her bridal hair and make up  but your regular cut  color and styling as well!! Go see her! You wont be disappointed ,?
63367,5 years ago  UMC saved my life  Plain and simple  I wouldnt be here  otherwise As for now  I had surgery Monday (5 days ago) and am here for bandage changes  No pain  at ALL since the back surgery  and I feel like myself again  :),?
63380,5 years later and Erik still does a great job for me  I can text him pictures and he can guesstimate what the issue is and he is always right!,?
64109,5/5/15 came here because the tv commercial was advertising a free biscuit burrito with any purchase 1  Waiting 20 mins in the drive thru 2  Got my order without free biscuit burrito  but because they took so long  I didnt have time to actually turn back 3  My am crunch wrap was cold and the cheese wasnt melted like it used to Very disappointed,?
64223,50 shades of grey clearly applies to this place  It was grey at 8pm and getting greyer at 11pm as I headed out the door  Band was a 80s/90s cover band  Despite the grey  there were others sprinkled in  you just had to move around to find them  People had secured tables early to listen to band  so stragglers have to work the fringes of the roomy bar to attempt any pickups  Dance floor way too crowded to get close  Televisions here are big and all over  so excellent sports viewing is available  As for food  I opted to try the famous sliders  Went for the Teriayki Chicken verson which was pretty boring as the small chicken breasts were covered with cheddar and then the dipping sauce was teriayki sauce  Barely ate 4 of the six for $9 99  They should include a few fries at that price with the sliders  but no luck there  Huge menu  so perhaps something else should be tried  but carmelized onions would have been perfect on those sliders next time ,?
64398,56 Kitchen provides a new  contemporary  refreshing atmosphere that Solon has needed for years  I travel to the East side of Cleveland frequently for work and am always searching for new spots to dine  56 Kitchens menu is diverse and well rounded providing the guests with a wealth of delicious entrees and options  Vegetarian  Vegan and Glutenfree options are available as well making this a one stop shop for everyone  I recently had the Hawaiian pizza and French Kiss salad and was very happy with the quality in both presentation and taste  If you are seeking a new restaurant in the Solon area  56 Kitchen is a must try!,?
64789,6 months now and no hits  nothing!!  I hope no one else gets suckered into this companys bullshit!!  I am sooooo fed up!!  Paid $200 (that I could not afford) for NOTHING!!!   I am not lowering the price of my motorcycle anymore!  I hope they go out of business!  Very angry customer!!,?
66035,702 is the best salon in the area  PERIOD  And Ive checked them all out  Even the feel you get from first walking in is unique  Service is great  Everything is done right the first time  Ill never go anywhere else or take my daughters anywhere else ,?
66122,777 Towing was notified by my insurance company of my disabled vehicle at 9pm  My original ETA was 10:27  I was stranded on I15 and Lake Mead  At 10:30  I called and was told it would be another 40 MINUTES! Keep in mind that I am a female sitting by myself in a rough area  At 11:15 I called back and was told it would be anither 30 MINUTES  By 11:45  I called again and was told the driver was on his way  It should only be twenty minutes  Guess what??? At 12:10 I called and the driver was LOST!! Are you kidding me? The driver came at 12:25am! I had been out there 3 1/2 hours! Even the NHP officer who checked on me said 777 Towing was TERRIBLE! She was right! Worst service I have ever seen!,?
66366,8 of us on Vegas for a few days  Couple came here first night and recommended for lunch  We call came back  Located near the high roller on side shopping walk Outside seating open with umbrellas  Nice atmosphere  Server attentive when taking our order and food out fast   Variety of menus items btwn the group ordered  Service not as great after food delivered  Had to go to bar for refills  Food pricey but large servings so good worth price  Loved the hush puppies with honey butter,?
66938,8We ordered: half everything cookie ice cream with chocolate peanut butter ice cream and a half birthday sugar cookie ice cream with mint chocolate ice cream  The store was very hard to fit into  was very hard to check out the different cookies while not getting into someones way  I felt the cookie was good  but the ice cream literally started melting the moment it was in the box with the wax paper  I couldnt even take a moment to relax after paying and getting out before my ice cream was starting to melt fast  I couldnt really enjoy it fully because of that  I wish the cookies were a bit more softer for my taste  I really liked the ice cream though  It had actual bits of peanut butter in it instead of just flavour  Because of the quick melting I couldnt take more then one pic of my cookie ice cream ,?
66968,8th Day has become one of my favorite coffee shops since moving to Phoenix just a few weeks ago  Ive been to 8th Day at least six times  My first experience was during First Friday  A friend and I walked to 8th Day earlier that afternoon to get some coffee  and Im glad we did  We returned later that night for more coffee  music  and poetry readings  Their art displays are very unique and encouraging  My favorite cold  summer drinks so far are the Rwandan Chill (with hazelnut instead of vanilla) and a Honey Hazelnut Cream Chill (noncoffee)  I definitely recommend both of those drinks! They like when I get creative  haha! The coffee is very good and is fairtrade  The service is beyond outstanding  There are plenty of places to just relax and enjoy your drink/food or even to meet with people  The only food Ive tried so far is the blackberry bran breakfast treat  it was very good! Its great to be able to sit down with friends  drink coffee  and do good ,?
67649,9:57 pm on 10/6/18  Its almost never fun to work on a Saturday night  but the cashier at the drive thru was friendly and helpful none the less!,?
68265,@redrockcasino is definitely my favorite casino outside of the strip Big and spacious  Classy and fabolous  Simple but beautiful are phrases that come to mine when I think of this casino  It lives up to its name red rock because they have beautiful rock/stone architecture inside  Because it is simply decorated  it may not get all the raves and oohs and ahhs but it is beautiful in its own way  I just like how big it is and how clean it is  Clean casinos are always nice!They have plenty of restaurants here  a great buffet  a bowling alley and pretty huge movie theatre and a nightclub called Cherry   (random note: Model Cindy Crawfords husband Rande Gerber owns Cherry) Red Rock is a resort for everyone  I just like walking around Red Rock because there seems to be something to do in every corner  Good food and enterntainment in a big  clean and simple casino  this place is a winner in my book ,?
68716,A 24/7 French bakery is just a genius concept in general  Have been coming here since the first weekend Ive moved in Charlotte 4 years ago and its been a staple place for me to take outoftowners ever since  Everyone says it  but they say it for a reason  You have to try the salted caramel brownie  Even if its just a few bites since its so rich   but its worth every bite  Their lattes are also great and ambiance in this place is fun  eclectic and stands out to the other local bakeries in town  Perfect spot for meeting friends/or catching up on work youll see both here   **Rumor has ittheyre opening a new 11 000 sq  foot location in Uptown replacing the College Plaza cafeteria at Wells Fargo Two  Uptown needs more local coffee shops (especially ones open on weekends)   so very excited about this!,?
69233,A Chinese and Mexican combo restaurant    concept: interesting  execution: not so great Definitely definitely overpriced  Seriously  6 pieces of dim sum for $18? I dont care if it has gold flake on it! Las Vegas highway robbery   I ended up having two tacos  the pollo with mole and the pork  They were both tasty (and tiny) but I was left wishing for some citrus or some crunchy cabbage  Depending on the taco you order  ONE taco can range from $4$10  FYI Cute decor and seating though Conveniently located right next to the entry for Marquee ,?
69759,A Great  Quaint & intimate venue! Pretty much any seat is ideal  Great energy! No parking fee  but on dirt lot throughout   Tickets a bit overpriced  Drinks & food way overpriced to be expected though  Food options VERY limited and nothing to write home about  A lot of tables & chairs to dine at  but are not occupied  It has a lot of potential with empty space to fill for activities and other food vendors  A must to check out!,?
70998,A SOLID 3 star  Muck better than Arahova  Huge portions  delicious tsatziki sauce (garlicky but not to the point where your mouth still tastes like garlic the morning after!) and affordable  Definitely hits the spot ,?
71609,A WASTE of Time and Money  We had to use Ace through our warrantee company and what a terrible experience  We had our AC unit blowing hot air and Ace replaced part by part making 5 visits in total  still not getting the problem resolved  In the end we had to get our warrantee company to send out another company who found that the lines were still clogged  Ace never follows up even when they say they will and comes out when it suites them not the customer  I would not recommend this company ,?
71846,A bar and grill Charming room with old plaster and high ceilings TV screens everywhere Great if you want to catch the game Less great if you want to talk to your beloved Average pub food Bar selection not wonderful but it will do If you go to the real Elephant and Castle in London It is a grim intersection of major roads and train tracks  It is ugly  It is a food desert The Toronto Elephant and Castle is prettier and has somewhat better food So Toronto can proudly say it outperforms London in Something That said  the Elephant and Castle is not Torontos greatest pleasure paradise ,?
72848,A big thank you to Mike Long and One Roofing Company!  The owner  Mike  came out to look at my roof   He and his team took before and after pictures so we could see the damage and the completed repairs   The crew was efficient and clean   Afterwards  there was a little confusion on my part  with some trim on my house that I thought was damage   Mike called me back to answer my questions and address my concerns   Overall  I am very happy with the work  and I have already recommended them to my neighbors   Thank you again Mike!,?
72909,A big thing for me is when a place offers are great overall experience  Its not enough to just have good food  especially for places like cafes where people hangout  Rather than restaurants where people usually just pass through quickly  This place delivers on many levels that most bubble tea places dont  Very comfortable seating  and cute decor  Fast internet  Exceptional food quality  Quiet ambiance  It just feels so comfortable here  The only potential negatives are that the menu is smallish(but the place is small anyway)  In terms of milk tea there are few options  If you are a hardcore milk tea fanatic and need a hundred options for your milk tea like cha time then this isnt the place for you  They offer many other kinds of drinks anyway  But if you need a cool place to hangout  have awesome food  or study  This place is for you ,?
73059,A bit dirty looking and the gym next door can be heard through the walls  and felt too when the weights are dropped  Any place where the owner allows workers to hang out in the pedichairs during slow times seems inattentive to sanitary conditions  cleaning should be done first  right?  Meh  Ive experienced better ,?
73754,A bit overpriced and the customer service isnt the greatest  a little on the detached  frostyside   But  the enchiladas are amazing  the main reason we keep going back ,?
73811,A bit overpriced  Portions are small  But food was excellent full of flavor! I had the lamb chops moist perfectly charred  The tamale with molasses butter was gross tasted like maple syrup! Blah! Hubby had green chile ciopinno  Very tasty but dang he needed for food  Service not bad attentive  Overall a bit over rated ,?
74019,A bit pricey however food is very good  Service is top notch so overall a good experience  Decor is pretty cool!,?
74046,A bit pricey  but excellent sammys  I recommend the Philly cheesesteak  Its excellent!,?
74091,A bit pricey  but worth it! Visited on a Friday at 11:30 AM for lunch  our party tried the Vegetarino and the Dame Edna pizza and a spinach  cheese  cranberry salad  All were great  but completely different The Dame Edna and salad had huge  thin  wafers of cheese; following the servers suggestion  my son added vinegar and oil to his Dame Edna pizza for a wonderful saladinapizza The Vegetariano had cheese  roasted peppers and sweet carmelized onions that was otherworldly good Service was prompt and well done without hovering Three lunches  two iced teas and water  plays time  was over $55  the only downside ,?
74306,A bit unimpressed over all  There are many clubs in Vegas obviously  This time we decided to try jewel because we earned free entry and free drink from playing mlife on our phones  It was awesome  The best thing was getting in the mlife line and getting quicker entry  However when we got there they actually didnt know where we were to stand  Finally someone said for us to move into a special line  It was great  We went in and went to the bar  The people before us ordered 2 drinks and it was 19 bucks  We get one drink each and all ranges 1618 each  Does the bartender just charge what she freakin wants???? The dance floor is small and theres only 1  We just went in had our drink hung out a little bit then left  It was nice just to see it  Its clean  Well maintained  But not something I would pay 30/40 pp to enter ,?
74517,A brand new sushi restaurant for the southwest part of town and best of all its AYCE   Its a small place on Rainbow  The food is good but not spectacular  The service is attentive and good  The only problem was the speed at which the food was served  The wait staff said the kitchen was backed up and it showed  While our initial order came out within five or ten minutes it wasnt complete   Subsequent orders took a long time or even forgotten  The restaurant was not too busy so we couldnt understand why the food came out so slowly   We will attribute this to growing pains   Overall a good experience but maybe with a few tweaks in the kitchen this could be a great place to come to ,?
74934,A bunch of idiot  Im from Calgary and went to pick up the car that i rented  but i lost my visa in the trip  I offered to use my mothers card and they dont want to   I offered to make transfer from my bank and no nothing to do they dont even care about youI will never go back there   Oh and it was supposed to be 125$ and they told me i needed an inssurance wich is 29$/day fuckin thieves !!!!,?
75004,A bunch of the girls were here for dinner for a bachelorette party   The place was packed  Even though we had reservations  we had to wait for quite awhile   We finally got seated and it took forever to order drinks and even longer to get our drinks   My drink was so strong that I actually had to add water to it! And even then it was barely drinkable   I wasnt impressed by the menu options   We ordered the queso dip as an appetizer which was the only thing that night that I liked   The service was slow the whole night and dinner took over 2 hours  and that doesnt include the time we had to wait to be seated   The waitress refused to split our checks so a bunch of the girls had to run out to an ATM  The bathroom was very small and dirty  there was always a huge line   Not impressed  pretty expensive  and I wont be going back ,?
75377,A carry on   bag was removed by another passenger  The airline personnel were asked to look at video of who took my bag  Instead however they sent me to the lost and found  I did not check the bag all I could do was a lost and found report  This was very frustrating and not the way to find who took the bag ,?
75601,A charlotte classic! So much so  i probably take it for granted   A love that they keep it simple  just great food  prepared quickly! Hard to find better quality on a daily basis   Dish and Roasting Company definitely have the best top to bottom options for sides!  You have to try the squash casserole at Roasting  its delicious   even if you arent a squash fan My go to entree is their smothered Chicken on Rice con Queso They also have daily specials that never disappoint   Also  A bunch of local beers on tap at the bar   Roasting pulls off the trifecta    they are good for a quick in and out lunch  grabbing drinks and snacks with friends or a casual sit down dinner ,?
75768,A chill place to hang out at ; me and my gf Bianca came here she introduced me cool vibes   We had a great bartender his name was Bobby kept us laughing and even thou he had a big party of 2030 people he tried to attend us as soon as possible  Definitely will be a go to spot when we want to hit that happy hour $2 mimosas  bloody Marys and belinis   Thats a great deal  Give good tips guys the bartender is hard working ! Remember us Bobby   Yesi & Bianca,?
76570,A coworker told me about this place and how they have specials everyday of the week which sounded great  Walked in for the first time and did not get greeted and just sat ourselves  Waited a little while for someone to greet or even give us the menues  Then came Leah    She was new on her first night    We did not know the menu and she did a great job  She was very tentitive and made the experience worthwhile ,?
78434,A couple years back I went to Vegas with my cousin and we partied our butts off for 3days  Than when it was time to go back home we headed off the main strip aka the strip and went here  Goodness was I in for a treat some of the best and real Thai Ive had when I say real I mean it was spicy  Which I love  when Im back in town Ill be returning here!,?
78933,A cross between Trader Joes and  for those of you that remember  Wild Oats from years gone by   I stop by here every now and then  usually for the produce  Sometimes they have deals that the larger chain stores just cant match  A lot of their stuff seems to come from Colorado so they must have a grower there or something They cover the gamut of grocery store items but just small enough as not to be overwhelming  Nice selection of bulk goods  candy  grains  etc  One of the better prices for Quinoa that Ive seen I like their deli  always fresh  Their breads are decent if not a little expensive  They make their sausages on site and typically have sales going on for themOne of the main things here is in summer they do fire roast real New Mexico Hatch chiles in the parking lot and sell them rather cheaply  They freeze nicely so I always stock up! If you like peppers  you should check it out Overall  seems to be pretty consistently good when I stop in ,?
79070,A cute and warm environment for Sunday brunch! I went with my mother and sister on Sunday early afternoon and although we did not have a reservation  we were seated quickly  Both the service and the food were excellent! We all split the Smores Pancakes and the Bacon Explosion Benedict with a side of Pad Thai Fries  The Smores pancakes came as a stack of pancakes filled with Nutella and topped with marshmallows  It was sweet  but not too sweet  Everything tasted great but the Bacon Benedict and Pad Thai Fries were the real winners  I would highly recommend Lisa Marie!,?
79126,A cute establishment in the West side in a strip mall  The cafe is spotless and modern  the coffee superb (including brewed decaf)  and the pastries are to expire for  They serve both sweet and savory crepes (the latter made from traditional French buckwheat)     all made to order Things I didnt like: This place epitomizes unpretentiousness as theres NO decor whatsoever! The few tables and chairs are arranged haphazardly  The beige walls lack decorations  theme  art  etc  consequently there is no ambiance or anything to look at  Additionally the bare walls  ceiling material and flooring all reflect sound  The place is noisy! All conversations reverberate annoyingly All that being said  the emporium has huge potential!,?
79694,A decent bar with really good food specials    The wings are some of they best Ive had    If you really want a challenge   try 6 of the 1822 wings    Taco Tuesday is OK but the Monday and Thursday wing nights are the best ,?
79828,A decent hotel for the price you pay  The fact they had a small gym was a super plus for me  Complex was safe to stroll around at night   youre situated right next to a hospital! The breakfast was good too  except the seating! During peak times at breakfast  dont be surprised to find yourself seated next to other guests staying at the hotel  Rooms are roomy and clean here  Staff can be sketchy when it comes to assisting you  Still worth staying here  Located a bit far from the main downtown area ,?
80445,A delicious spot to get Dim Sum for dinner  Excellent service  My husband ordered the orange chicken and loved it  We will definitely be back again ,?
80472,A delicious  generous brunch with excellent service We were in the early side  so werent able to take advantage of the affordable mimosas  but that is definitely next on the list I particularly enjoyed the pancake medallions   Just big enough to get the taste  but small enough to leave room for the rest of your breakfast ,?
81503,A fairly new location  much cleaner and more modern than the location at Oxford  A but more of a sports bar vibe here  and the service is a little better  People complain that the wings are small but at least theyre all meat and not all fat/skin  Im a fan of the flavours as there are quite a few options  but nothing as redundant and overdone as All Stars or Wild Wing  St Louis really wins me with their fries  Perfectly crispy on the outside and fluffy inside  and interestingly wavecut  The house sauce that comes in the plastic package is also a signature that separates St Louis from the rest ,?
82103,A fantastic meal from another culture  Has made the Best of the Best in Charlotte for a reason  Great service  ambiance and even better food ,?
82204,A fantastic renovation for a neighborhood gem  The main screen is huge and the seats are really comfortable  The concessions are ok; would love to see more locally made foods  And it could not be more centrally located to bars  restaurants  etc  Too bad the second floor theaters are not handicap accessible  But I get that thats not possible because of the buildings historic status ,?
82580,A favorite restaurant in Las Vegas! The food  service and ambiance are spectacular ,?
84490,A few years ago we started eating here and loved it! The last few visits have been less than enjoyable  Mediocrity has become the new norm here  Not at all busy but had to wait for a table to be cleaned in the bar area to get seated  There seemed to be lots of unenthusiastic employees present but last visit had the barkeep serving tables  Not nearly attentive enough  Fries were COLD on plate with a burger that was not hot either and a bun that seemed almost stale   Never offered an additional serving of bottomless fries   Needs a cleanup/makeover and better employee attitude/morale  Sadly  our last visit will be our last visit ,?
84804,A first for me  After two beers and waiting an HOUR  we got up  left our Groupon on the table and walked out  I cant rate nonexistant service  I have truly never done that before  Were now at Oreganos:),?
85071,A four star property with a zero star customer experience  Especially at the Palms Place pool where they cant begin to define experience over the own job roles  The CEO and President of the Palms Casino report ought to just hang out by the pool and attempt to rotate their chairs to track the sun and feel the wrath from the helpIve restructured worse properties do multi billion Asian investments in worse locations  Wow  Just shows how important the finer details of customer experience are so important and have made Ritz Carlton Apple and Starbucks owner managers so profitable and financially independent ,?
85385,A friend and I came in for lunch today  Its a smaller place but very cozy  I ordered the Rosemary Chicken Pasty  It had chicken  red peppers  potatoes and brie  The crust was delicious as well as the filling  but i didnt taste the rosemary as much as I thought I would but the flavor was still good  Also it was just lukewarm and would have been better if it was a little hotter  The service was great and she was knowledgeable about the menu  I will be back!,?
86057,A friend and I visited Jinya during happy hour after hearing good things  It definitely did not disappoint  We ordered several dishes including: Salmon Poke Tacos  Pork Tacos  Jinya Bun  Salmon Cilantro Sashimi  and Jinya Tonkonsu Black Ramen  All of it was very good and I look forward to trying other items on the menu  The waiter did forget our drinks but no big deal  he was very knowledgeable and gave good recommendations when it came to the food  I will definitely be back *Visited Aug/17,?
86073,A friend and I visited for brunch today  They had a pretty wide selection of Eggs Benedict  omelets  pancakes  etc  I decided to go with the Scottish Eggs Benedict with the spicy hollandaise sauce  It was delicious  It was served with house fries which were tasty  but a little drenched in oil (I think)  My friend has their oatmeal with brown sugar and bananas and a couple hard poached eggs  She really liked it! The staff was friendly  It was quite bustling  but didnt take too long to get our food I will definitely be returning to try more things on the menu!,?
86584,A friend brought Slymans over to a party  so I cant speak to the service or the ambiance of the place  The sandwich  though  was alright  I really like corned beef  and the meat on the sammy is good  but a bit dry  I mitigated the situation with extra mustard  but then flavor is lost  There is A LOT of meat on each sandwich!I prefer the corned beef from Mr  Brisket on S Taylor ,?
86950,A friend hit a Royal for $1000 and invited us to come share a celebratory bevvie!So we obliged  so as to not be rude!My first time at this location and it was pretty nice  The decor is Vegas centric and slightly upscale  I had a Not Your Fathers Root beer which is a tasty alcoholic version of root beer  The staff were friendly and introduced themselves to us newcomers  I notice that most poker bars do this and its a nice touch for the most part  Unless youd rather remain anonymous!Their menu has a nice variety and we heard a few patrons talking about what food they liked there  There are a few other The Bar outposts located in my neck of the woods so its unlikely that Ill be frequenting this one ,?
87796,A friend of mine saw this place on a TV show and decided to drag me along to check the place out  I know this kind of restaurant well  The inside it clean but a little rough around the edges  which there is nothing at all wrong with  When I get on my motorcycle I hate riding to an chain restaurant simply because it is the same cookie cutter crap we all know and accept  This place was unique The Waiter was very friendly and quick to joke  I would have given this place 4 or 5 stars  but while he was friendly he was a bit forgetful  My friend had to order the same drink 3 times before he got it  which took about 30 minutes  Also they had a number of things they were out of  The burger was very good  Not world class but worth every penny  My friend tried the burger challenge (1lb of beef plus a ton of other stuff) and was defeated  Not a bad place  but some supply and service issues ,?
88343,A friend recommended Gina for me and so I made an appointment with her! She was great to work with and did amazing on my eyebrows  I had her personal phone number messaging her asking if a third session would be extra and she told me no problem and that it wasnt extra money  I went to my third appointment and after she proceeded to tell me that it was free of charge because I still have the messages of her saying that it was fine  I got to my appointment and she told me I had to pay 75 dollars for that touch up  Initially to my appointment I paid  400 dollars then tipped her 45  Very displeased with how she handled the situation telling me that she told me it was an extra 75 dollars when she didnt ,?
88743,A friend recommended this restaurant and Im so glad we came here to eat  My family and I came here for a late lunch and the BBQ is so delicious!! Especially the beef!  Also  the customer service here is excellent  all the staff were friendly and made sure we were taken care of  Would definitely come here again ,?
88782,A friend recommended this to me  and I cant figure out why   The food was underwhelming and pricey   The service was fine  and the place looked nice  but I can barely remember what I ate there it was so forgettable ,?
88840,A friend referred me to Clear Way and I am so glad I used them   They arrived on time  installed new faucets and put everything back and left zero mess   Very impressed   I look forward to using again ,?
88937,A friend suggested Big Ben when we were in Charlotte for a day  The service was excellent and they had decent beer specials  Nice decor as well! I ordered the turkey wrap with a cup of their soup of the day  which was bacon  spinach and cheese  The soup was amazing! The turkey wrap was pretty standard  nothing special  but it was good  If I lived in the area  I could see myself hanging out here a lot!,?
89580,A friend who lives in Vegas invites up for lunch to this place which is located in the palace station hotel and casino (off the strip)   Its actually about 12 seat around a bar and because of the limited number of seats and high demand there is a long wait   The wait can be between 1 Ro 3 hours   I think its open 24 hours The food is very good   cooked at the bar right in front of you   The cook asks you  how spicy do you want your food between 1 to 10   I asked for 8 since I love spicy food   But I recommend 4 or 5   I could barely eat mine But it was delicious well worth the wait ,?
89680,A friendly donut shop with flavorful selections  Their donuts are thicker than something most would got from Dunkin Donuts or 7/11  Donuts range from $1 upwards to $5  Its a cozy little bar with stylish furniture  I recommend those visiting here to try this place out for breakfast  just expect nothing but donuts and coffee/alcohol ,?
90274,A fun way to hang out for a couple of hours! I give it 4 stars only because their prices are unnecessarily high  Luckily  I found an awesome $13 Groupon for an hour of unlimited entry  All in all  I really enjoyed taking my little brother here  Its a blast! Theres rock climbing  mini golf  bumper cars  this weird tight rope walking stuff  and a mini version of American ninja warrior obstacles  Fun for (almost) all ages ,?
90935,A girlfriend who lives around the corner introduced me to this place and I have to say  Im happy she did! Not only were the staff super friendly  Its a small spot but I think thats what gives it so much character  The cocktails were very impressive! Fresh ingredients used too  always a win with me! I dont think you can go wrong with any drink you order  Highly recommend checking it out if youre on the hunt for a great cocktail  Cheers!,?
91698,A good friend refered me to this restaurant as we were on a Taco shop kick for the month  i had no idea tacos could be so amazing  The salsa bar is out of this world ,?
91792,A good introduction to Brazilian Churrascaria dining the staff was prompt  courteous and truly helpful you will get a free photo postcardSalad bar was alright and meat selection was tolerable but for the Churrascaria dinner    go to Fogo de Chao ,?
92419,A good place to watch the show in Montreal at the TD stage   Food is not bad  But be prepared to have a full lunch or dinner  you should order 2 to 4 dishes per person  because portions are very small  As a result we got the overpriced bill  comparing with other Montreal restaurants where food was better,?
92602,A good sized branch of Chapters  seemingly larger than its counterpart in the Oshawa Mall  Which means it often has more stock  particularly specific items that arent carried elsewhere  The toy section is also notably larger As with all other Chapters Ive been in  the staff are helpful and will readily order in any book that they dont have in stock ,?
93534,A great auto part store for tired  accessories and batteries   Quick and efficient   And the best part is the people who work there   They know their stuff and make certain that you are getting the material and service you need   No BS and good for the ladies that might feel a bit intimidated going into such a store   Not at NTB   Seems to me that ladies get BETTER service and  of course  ATTENTION  than we grubby guys   This is a new location and it is immaculate   The bay areas and store area will certainly take a beating soon as I imagine that more and more parts buyers will be coming in who also need wheels and batteries   And more Right on Hwy 521 and Doby Bridge Road  Indian Land ,?
93582,A great bar/restaurant specializing in all types of imported beer  Their draught and bottle list is quite extensive with lots of hard to find beer  If you cant decide on a specific beer or feel like being experimental  they also have sample sizes ($6 for 3 samples) As a group we tasted 7 different beers   everything ranging from a super smoky German beer (with a campfire like aroma!)  wheat beers  various ales and everything was super tasty  Sadly we didnt try any of the food  though it looks wonderful and everything comes with a beer suggestion We came here around 9pm and it was very clear this is definitely an after work style hangout  Most people here are dressed in suits and trying to relax   no dress code is enforced  but youll look out of place going completely casual Enjoy!,?
93664,A great breakfast spot in downtown Calgary   It is looked in a very cool old building  however it is a small space so you can sometimes run into long waits and spotty service While the menu is somewhat limited  they do cook a good breakfast   I really enjoy the eggs and hash browns   Anyone looking for a good eat should check it out ,?
93887,A great club to join if you would like to meet ski and snowboarding enthusiasts in Toronto  Lessons offered with certified instructors on day trips and weekend excursions  The club also offers charter trips around the world ,?
94741,A great haircut at low prices  Friendly staff  We have two special needs kiddos  and they are always treated with respect and welcomed even when they have to come in just for moms appointments ,?
94964,A great little BBQ place! Ribs were moist  juicy  and came apart with a plastic fork  Coleslaw was amazing  They also have fried okra  which is awesome! This place is a very good deal with the Groupon! Our group of six ate two full slabs of ribs and sides for around 45 bucks  We were all stuffed and very satisfied  I would highly recommend this place!,?
94992,A great little Tibetan joint  Shambala pays tribute to the traditional eats of Nepalese cuisine  Dont worry  not so traditional where you have to squat on the floor to eat )Momos  Himalayan dumplings  are quite delicious and I would recommend them  I usually go for the steamed ones since theyre a little healthier that way  but pan fried tastes awesome as well The Langsha Shamdey harkens some of the Indian influences on Tibetan cuisine and they do a decent rendition of it  Spicy and savoury  a good meal on a cold Winters day ,?
95566,A great lunch find!  We happened to be in the East Valley and made a special trip to this little gem after reading about it online  We ordered a two piece chicken meal and a half a chicken meal  My eyes were bigger than my stomach but I managed to eat every last delectable bite  The Chicken was moist and well seasoned  The Tortillas warm and pliable  The beans zesty and the rice was some of the best Mexican rice I have eaten  The dishes were accompanied with fresh cubes  pickled onions and lemon to add a punch to our meal  Great family owned restaurant  We will drive across town to eat here again  Wish it was in our hood ,?
95956,A great number of stores here  especially if you need something you didnt pack for your Vegas trip  its all conveniently located here  My only complaint is how confusing this mall is to navigate  Its like a maze in there,?
95959,A great off the beaten path bar and grill that blends good beer  great ambience and a good menu! If they focus on maintaining quality food they will do well!,?
96045,A great park in the southwest part of town  Plenty of shade for the kiddos  Its always clean when were here  Theres a baseball field  tennis courts and a huge field for the kids to run & play  One of my kids favorite by far ,?
97091,A great place to get a serious Crossfit workout  The trainers are great!  I drive past other Crossfit gyms  just to come here for the wods and the people ,?
97963,A great place! We went on a tip from a friend a great tip! Tasty beer! Food was a little different than typical bar/pub fare everyone was happy with their choices ,?
98438,A great spot for a morning snack! We normally order: the smoked salmon and cream cheese on a toasted bagel  an almond croissant  a chocolate chip cookie  a coffee  and a tea   Our total is normally around $17 00  approximately This spot is charming  the cookies are delicious  the pastries are fresh and flaky  and they serve good coffee! Its a great cafe to visit for beginning your morning  sipping your coffee and reading the newspaper  or chatting with friends and family  Its an environment thats open to all types of parties  with consistently delicious pastries  Service isnt the friendliest  but the food and atmosphere make up for it  Overall  one of our favourites!,?
98607,A great staff that stands behind their work  A great company with integrity and quality work ,?
99010,A great way for us to close a vacation  The dishes arent cheap  but ordering a few to share makes it more doable  We had a cold lobster salad crustini dish  a braised ox cheek over mashed potatoes  and a big meat paella to share  Theres also an espresso dessert drink that was awesome  Perk: they make their desserts in house  including the BEST molten lava cake Ive had in my life ,?
99026,A great way to get out to enjoy theater and other events all for FREE once you are a member  Ballet  Concerts  Minor league sports  WNBA and more  ,?
99143,A great  little dessert shop in the Market Village you should definitely check out if youre ever in the mood for something sweet and refreshing  Ive been here a couple of times and they offer a variety of good stuff ranging from teas  soups and puddings! They serve up both hot/cold desserts but no matter what  I will ALWAYS get the cold desserts (even if its freezing and theres a snow storm outside  people will think Im crazy but whatever)  Theyre just soooo thirst quenching and I like the cold  chilly feeling it gives me in my mouth as I eat it  My alltime favorite dish would have to go to the Tapioca  Herb Jelly and Watermelon Combination  Its ooohh soooo good  I wish I had some right now! Its a nice once in a while change from the typical waffle  crepe and ice cream desserts ,?
99240,A group of 10 of us came into this restaurant on Tuesday  all kids under 12 eat free  We had 4 kids with us 3 of which got pizza  The wait was over 45 minutes  The pizza sauce was out of the refrigerator cold on the pizza  when we asked for the pizza to be heated up more the waitress was very rude  We then got charged for every meal when we were told kids are free on Tuesdays  When we asked about our bill our waitress started in with attitude again  walking away before we had finished asking our questions  We asked for every single drink refill as well  DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME!,?
99256,A group of 10 of us were attending a training near here and checked it out for lunch  Wow! We were all impressed at the price  size and quality of the food  it was amazing! Not to mention the owner and staff were very friendly and accommodating  Highly recommend!,?
100339,A group of us stopped here under the recommendation of my friends cousin  whos a Phoenix local  A few of us decided to join the party a little late  because we werent that hungry at the time  My brother changed up and ordered a side salad while I added some chicken strips to a separate order  The food for the others looked decent  but no one was finishing the food after claiming to be so hungryThey mixed up orders  were slow on service  and while some of the food had no flavor(pot roast trio with Mac and cheese)  or was cold (the chicken wings  which looked great!!) my chicken strips were decent  and the beer was good  After all of that the server tells us the system is down so we have to wait for it to get our bill ) yeah right  call the manager! I had to make him calculate our order by hand after waiting 20min for the system to recover  I wont need to come back here but hope this location tightens up!Atmosphere was a cool large sports bar vibe with a lot of TVs ,?
100646,A gun store that will facilitate all your needs and if they dont have it right then  they will order it in  Bought two firearms and plenty of ammo  keep it up guys!,?
100932,A helpful bartender who was sensitive to the time limit of my 2person party enhanced my experience at this establishment   My boyfriend and I stopped in for a quick bite and brew before a home Sunday night Steelers game   We were staying at a nearby hotel  The Priory Hotel  and were directed here due to the close proximity and time crunch we were facing   The place can accommodate larger groups  as there was a gettogether of approximately 20 people seated in the main dining area   We both had burgers  which were cooked to our specified requests and a few brewskis  of which they had a cooler full of bottles and multiple ontap   Dont let the somewhat negative reputation of the North Side deter you   I would come here again in the future!,?
101173,A hidden gem in Richmond Hill  Came at 5:00pm on Sunday evening  we just needed some quick dinner after reading some good reviews  I have to agree with other reviewers  This is a family restaurant  small but cozy  clean dining area and washroom   Service is very casual and friendly  just perfect for a casual quick dining for Sunday night   We ordered halibut family meal $22 95 for two  1 piece of haddock $7 25 an its own and small Greek Salad $4 25  All very decent size  fresh and delicious  the best so far in Richmond Hill   We highly commend it to anyone who would like a quick and quality meal  I would give 5 stars if they dont have sign hanging with Dollar rama price lable beside visible or power bar cord visible on the floor ,?
101876,A hidden treasure off the strip  Great microbrewery and great prices  Friendly staff and outstanding karaoke  Food is reasonably priced and damn good  You cant go wrong here at all if you want off the ripoff strip,?
102111,A hole in the wall place that I would have walked past if not for these yelp reviews  Very tasty dumplings!Will repeat visit when I am in the area ,?
102273,A horrible take at Korean food  even if you take into account the term fusion The food here just doesnt taste right  I think the only thing that tasted remotely Korean are the fried dumplings  if you mess that up  thats pretty bad    I also remembered that one time I ordered the pork bulgogi  it wasnt fully cooked (i e  pieces of the meat were still red)  We brought that to our waiters attention and rather than either recooking it or giving me an entirely new dish  he had it microwaved for me  Not cool Anyways  good Korean food does not exist in the Madison area  You may be tempted to think otherwise  but you might be sorely disappointed ,?
102361,A hotel that plans bachelor parties  BAD IDEAWas put in charge of hosting a bachelor party recently and this hotel seemed excited to serve us  Daniela even helped us plan our stay First off  its a knock off hotel  Reminds me of a 3 star Holiday Inn with snazier paint  Rooms are small  little amenities (no full restaurant on site) for the price of 5 star hotel  Complete money grab on the hotel alone Problem is  their planning was awful  Useless We couldnt even get in to the club they suggested and made reservations for on the first night  It was up saint laurance  Seriously???? The second night wasnt any better  we were forced to wait in line to get into the buenos noches for over AN HOUR with Danielas reservation again It was an awful experience  Their suggestions were awful  the reservations DIDNT WORK  and we got completely scammed  And the place was full of other bachelor parties  No women at all only other dudes ,?
102516,A huge selection of lights and fantastic customer service   No pushy sales tactics here   I asked a bunch of questions and boy did they know what they were talking about (in fact I even learned a few things about ceiling fans)   Saw the lamp I bought somewhere else for $80 cheaper here       Walked out today with a great and inexpensive ceiling fan to replace the granny version I have at home   A bonus  they have a pug named Fritz who is super cute ,?
104091,A little disappointing since we were told this was a great place for Mexican food  The salsa was very bland with the extra thin chips  Our beers came very slowly  the frosted glass was melted  I had the Mahi mahi tacos  The tortillas were good  like homemade  The fish was nicely seasoned and grilled but the pineapple salsa and black beans were blah  The decor was pleasant but well  keep looking for authentic Mexican  ,?
104279,A little gem in Chandler  First  amazing service I came here with a large group (a waiters nightmare) and they were super accomodating! They have a killer happy hour deal    And the tapas are fresh and very tasty the octopus is a must try! It really shows the chefs effort and appreciation of Spanish tapas  The restaurant space is little awkward a long narrow rectangle but bar seats are comfy  Give this place a chance if you are in the area ,?
104726,A little miscue on the online ordering but they more than made up for it  serving chips and salsa while we waited for our takeaway   It only took about 15 minutes for our made to order tacos  burritos  and guacamole   Everything was excellent  the guacamole obviously made from scratch and the burritos each a meal by itself   The chorizo and the al pastor tacos were perfect  The only downside was we ordered way too much!  They have table service as well  so next time we will dine in   Highly recommended ,?
105714,A little pricey  but the service and products are GREAT!!! I enjoyed my experience here and would go back when Im in need of a tea splurge     Thanks for bringing in a wide variety of teas & making tea drinking fun!!!Cheers!!!,?
106323,A local brewer that produces some mighty fine beers  The food is typical brewery pub offerings that are just that  The restaurant is spacious and they offer live entertainment  It is a favorite of the locals in the area and is a destination for others  They have a happy hour special that is $8 for a great burger  fries  and your choice of a 1/2 beer from anything they produce  There are pretty good offerings but that was my favorite  They hold concerts here from time to time  So  check their website to see whats doing  #vinosquared  #vino2ultimate,?
106421,A local food establishment that make a wide variety of Italian sausages by hand and they also make their own spaghetti sauce  everything is made to order  from what I can tell  so if you order food to eat there also order a glass of wine  they have a number of red and white options and find yourself sliding into the Italian frame of mind while you wait for your food to be prepared  In addition  I almost always get an order of hot Italian sausage so I can make my own spaghetti sauce at home  Along with the sausages you can get canned tomatoes from Italy and any number of delicacies from the land of pizza and pasta  I must like this place because I have a strong urge to stop in every time Im in the area  A wonderful little bastion of Italian food culture ,?
106427,A local friend decided to take us to one of his favorite places  So we excepted and ended up being very delighted  I ended up having some Salmon and my friend had the Meatloaf Both were very  very good  I liked my Salmon but to be honest  his dish was better We both had desert  mine was a cobbler and his was a chocolate creation that was almost as good as my cobbler What topped off my meal was the beer selection which was so good I had a hard time deciding Ask for the fries extra crispy and get mayo on the side if you want to eat your frittes properly ,?
106885,A lot has been said  so Ill keep it brief  Very nice  slightly underground patio Buckwheat crepes  one of the best Ive ever had with very interesting toppings in sweet and savoury Good chocolate  It could be overwhelmingly rich  so chose carefully and savour!Coffee is good  just not hot enough  I kept trying first with caramel mocha  then espresso  and finally an americano  It was me searching for coffee heaven that morning  The amount of whipped cream on top of that mocha  boy  it could easily have been a meal in itself ,?
107344,A lot of my posts are of 5 star experiences but its because I only write about the greats  or my peeps and I made the experience regardless  This place is classic  If Im not at the game itself  or at home watching it on TV  this is where Id be every Sunday  Plenty of screens for all the games at once without having to kink your neck to watch  Every flavor of wings a mafucka would want  Sometimes I get anxious worried about whether Ill get enough different types of wings or if Ill need to get something in addition to wings  At this place Im calm and able to eat just wings and leave satisfied  Also they have lil popcorn bags you can take with you on the trip home  Genius  More like winking iguana!,?
107380,A lot of options! Friendly staff! I had a great time in the store  low prices and name brand stuff  I was walking all around this store  finding new stuff  The staff was quick with restocking the racks with the clothes people tried on  Will be back again!,?
107979,A lovely dinner in all the ways!  I heartily recommend the January version of the tasting menu  but do arrive with a big appetite   Highlights included the tofuseon (burdock was a nice taste and texture kick)  roasted cauliflower   poached lobster  matcha rice cake (perfectly crispy shell!)  and bread pudding (sublime)  but every dish was prepared and plated with precision and intricacy   The Antidote was a great cocktail choice  refreshing and easy   Service was warm and prompt A word to the wise: if youre gonna linger for awhile  try to nab one of the wicker seats for a more comfortable meal ,?
109843,A must see   Try to time your hike 45pm to catch the sunset and plus the sun will not be too much to handle ,?
110806,A nerdy and cozy place to chill and play board games with friends  The price is pretty good  around $3~$5 per person  They also have a discount on Tuesdays (Stay fee reduced to $2 when you order)  Since its open until after midnight  its perfect for a late night date/hangout ,?
111049,A new dessert place in markham but they also serve regular food like pasta and pizza   I enjoyed their Mochi waffle which was delish and they also knock 10 percent off our bill for my sisters birthday which was super sweet   The staff is also super nice ,?
111481,A new tradition for us trying a new breakfast joint every Saturday  This one does not disappoint! Staff is friendly and attentive  We were seated right away  Good quality  strong coffee is always a good start  I had the Breakfast Mac  Wow! You can smell the aroma of the truffle oil as soon as the dish arrives  The flavors all work so well together  The taste is rich and decadent! Portions are very healthy  enough for lunch and dinner me  Who says you cant have pasta for breakfast? The menu is huge and with a lot of variety and uniqueness  This is a keeper!,?
111617,A nice Irish pub just off Bay Street  You get a mix of young professionals finishing work and college students out on a typical evening   but it doesnt feel like a work bar or college bar  more like a neighbourhood place  This place is nothing spectacular  with a standard pub fare menu and the standard set of beers found at any Irish pub  There is a lovely patio facing College St and I have wasted too many nights sitting there with a beer in hand    and there will be many more ,?
111980,A nice coffee house in downtown Vegas  I had some good espresso shots  which made up for my initial disappointment at not being able to order a beer (which are only available after 7) The ambiance is nice and relaxing and it was nice to find something besides Starbucks in Vegas  Id go back again next time Im in Vegas ,?
112192,A nice hidden gem on the outskirts of Vegas! If you want authentic Japanese food  you should come here!We were greeted by a cute Japanese lady  Their menu offers ramen  rice bowls  appetizers and drinks What we tried:*Tempura Udon  Very good! The noodles were cooked perfectly  The broth was light and comforting  The shrimp tempura was really good! The batter was light and crispy *Spicy Char Siu Ramen  Very good! The level of spice was medium and just right  They are generous with the pieces of char siu they give you For Thai Tea boba lovers  this place offers BOGO free!There is a lot of free parking in the lot ,?
112676,A nice new hotel  Very comfortable and clean  Breakfast every morning and free parking  I will be back ,?
112836,A nice place that serves great beer  It does not have food  After a couple of beers  you need to leave to get food at another place and finish the day/night there  Bartenders are friendly and decor is pleasant ,?
112852,A nice place to come with the family  We also took a train ride  Cost $3 per tickets 1 ticket per person child under 2 age are free,?
113031,A nice place   Actually  a little too nice for my tastes   I like my bars just a bit rowdy   I often feel Im being too loud at Montmarte   However  they do get some great bands in here   And the drinks are always wellcrafted ,?
113840,A note to the people who gave this place 4 or 5 stars  Have you ever been to a restaurant before? Was this the first time you ever eaten food? This place is bad from top to bottom  The food is not good  and the dining room area smells terrible  There are no signs that can be seen from the north  so anyone coming from 90 would miss it completely ,?
115197,A pleasant place to stay  parking  food atmosphere  professional EXCELLENT CUSTOMER SERVICE  Thank You very much for making my birthday   ,?
116754,A random  but cool store to get almost anything dried   meat  fruit  vegetables  chocolates  nuts and candies are all available here   The selection is impressive and I cant imagine anyone leaving this store empty handed ,?
117603,A really good place  the  brisket  pulled pork and sausage are excellent! The Mac and cheese was off the chain but the fried okra needs a little help  the breading wasnt consistent and at times  it overpowered the okra  I drank Arnold Palmers because their lemonade reminds you of grandmas   ok!,?
118887,A revamp was well over due  glad to see the owner finally putting money into this location with its rickety chairs  Recently  the more mature staff has been brining their kids to work with them and it is EXTREMELY distracting  as a patron looking for a quiet cup of coffee  to have children bopping about (opening and closing doors  making noise) or loudly asking questions to their Mommmmm  The young adult staff tend to gather here when off  going in and out of the kitchen area as if it were their own living room  plus innappropiate conversations are had  Overpriced coffee  but I tolerate it since there are no other establishments in the area  This place is fine for  grabbing something to go  but unless you want to hear about the staffs skateboarding adventures  being stoned  second jobs   youd better skip the sitdown coffee experience ,?
119471,A seriously nofrills food court congee and rice rolls option in a busy strip mall food court  The food is cheap  plentiful and served with the usual no nonsense attitude of people needing to get places fast  Be prepared to share a table with strangers when it gets busy and be careful where you put your elbows on the frequently used tables  The congee is not the best Ive had  It is on the watery side but has plenty of ingredients in it so works well to wash down the rice rolls  Plenty of roll options to choose from and you can always add an egg to it if you want  The rice rolls themselves are on the thicker side  but goes well with all the sauces that you can freely pour onto your Styrofoam plate  Cheap and quick  an okay place to just eat and go when craving congee but short on cash ,?
119547,A shame   most of the meat would have been much better if it were taken from heat sooner  Much too well done  Great idea   poor execution  Confusion on billing from our waiter  Meat servers tried to get us more medium to rare pieces ,?
119928,A sister restaurant to my homebase Robbie Foxs I was lucky to attend a soft opening a few weeks back and was unbelievably impressed  The building is gorgeous  the decor and design are superb  I especiallly liked seeing all the different rooms and pictures  especially all the ones of JFK! The old church organ in the main dining room is a wonderful touch! Since it is a new establishment  the new servers will eventually get their legs  same goes for the food being cooked in the back  Chef Mark though has created a wonderfully tasteful menu  It makes me jealous of the food at Robbies  The owners Robbie and Dominic have worked very hard on this new pub and it shows  I wish I lived closer to it though  there are no signs of obnoxious ASU students to detract from the environment!!!! I forsee Johnny Foxs becoming the best pub in the west valley; dishing out pints of Craic for years to come!,?
119933,A sitdown Mexican place in front of El Gordos  My husband told me he used to come here as a child  we brought his Mom with us and she said she doesnt think they ever changed the interior  It looks exactly the same  First impression about the whole restaurant its small and it smells old :) but the food is good  Big servings and they give you free nacho chips with salsa (we probably had 4 bowls while waiting for food to arrive)  The servers are super friendly and they made sure our drinks were refilled  Waiting time for food was probably around 20 minutes ,?
120149,A small boutique hotel with a lot of history and charm  This hotel is situated right along the water in Old Port  Upon driving up you knew you were not in the city center  but a more lovely  remote part of town The lobby is a bit dark and small  the the staff was friendly  and upon walking into my room I knew the exact reason why I picked this one from the photos! The room is quaint and overlooking the water  Exposed brick  clean white bed (which was insanely comfortable and got some of my best hotel sleeps in) with beautiful decorative headboard  and oh  Le Labo bath products  score!Food they have a restaurant connected to the hotel which I ate one day for breakfast (not included)  Nice enough but wasnt worth eating there 2 days in a row with all the great places in the area in walking distance!No gym in the hotel  but they directed me to a hotel around the corner that gives us access with an Auberge room key ,?
120636,A small place  the food is great  The curry fries are fantastic and a must order!The staff is friendly and the decor is very cozy in an authentic traditional way  I really enjoyed Curry Corner and will likely come back again,?
123635,A tiny little place with a powerful statement in flavor  Had the Tonkatsu Black  The broth was thick and packs plentiful flavor  Service was prompt as it was near closing time when I was seated  Staff was very friendly and I was a bit surprised that they kept their smiles every time I look up as it was the end of the night when people are typically tired  The only thing I didnt fancy was that the washroom was 4 ft in front of me  Good thing nobody had any belly disagreement  Like I said   tiny place ,?
123930,A total joy!  Yes it is located off the strip  but not to far   With Uber now  anything is reachable I myself walked there from the SpringHill Suites  not bad at all The Casino was very small  but I only went for the DDD coverage of Fat Choy!Very clean inside and the staff was very friendly  Val was very nice and helpful to me   Was sorry to read Tracie Gs review  hopefully she gives it another shot Had the Pork Bao   Awesome!  Just perfectly cooked and great flavor palate Also had the short rib grilled cheese   another homerun!  Short rib was juicy and flavorful Looking forward to another trip to Vegas to try more food on the menu!,?
124266,A trip to Italy minus the airfare! From our burrata starter to the porcini mushroom fettuccine  veal saltimbocca  grilled salmon and panna cotta dessert  everything was done to perfection  Very fresh  high quality food in ample portions for sharing  The wine list is superb and we discovered a Venetian white by Zenato that went well with everything  Cant wait to go back in the summer when the terrasse is open!,?
124491,A true delicatessen  Dont let the surroundings discourage your patronage  Bagels were insanely delicious and fresh  Wait staff is efficient  Woman behind counter gives it a New York flair  Will stop here on every trip I make back to Vegas ,?
125311,A unique place for the district  Has an upscale feel on one side but still has tv screens showing sports behind the bar which takes away a little from the ambiance  Menu is small but food is good  Drink selection is decent  Music is too loud to have much of a conversation and the service isnt terribly fast  If you are interested in a leisurely night of a few drinks and a few snacks where you dont wont to talk much then this is the perfect place for you ,?
127243,A very nice clean venue but the hostess and servers acted like we were bothering them  Our party of four ordered two Cubano sandwiches  a beef panini and a club sandwich  There was very little meat in the Cubano sandwiches  the panini was cold  the cheese not even melted  I sent it back asking that they put it back into the press for a little longer  When it was brought back it was obvious that they microwaved it resulting in rubbery bread  The server never asked how our meal was  They charged $21 to $23 for each of the sandwiches and fifty cents each for water  Very disappointed!,?
127485,A very nice place  just as my girlfriend says its a place where you can taste authentic Thai food while enjoying the cozy furnishings  I will definitely recommend this place to people who addict to Southeast Asian Food ,?
128849,A week ago I called and made an appointment to get my hair cut and styled   I have medium length straight hair thats not too thick or thin   Apparently I was booked with a Master Stylist  although this was not told to me on the phone when I made the appointment   In the chair I was told the stylist was a master stylist and that my haircut would be $10 extra because of that   I went ahead thinking Id get a better haircut   When I got home  for 3 days I tried to get the right side of my hair that hangs down on each side of my face below my shoulders to be even   It was an inch longer on the right than the left   I figured it was the way I was wearing it since a master cut my hair   Finally I lobbed off the extra inch of hair on the right side and now its even   I brought photos of how I wanted it styled but it was left several inches too long on top to the point that I now have Mushroom head hair   I wouldnt recommend this salon   I have to go get my haircut again ,?
129053,A welcome break from the fast pace and Flashing Lights of Vegas    sponsored by Natures Glory It is often said that natural beauty  is beauty at its best and that statement couldnt be truer then at Red Rock  The experience of serenity that comes over you as you walk amongst the amazing red hues and National Geographic picture worthy cliffs  cant be captured in a phone pic for IG  It is truly an experience to be present here  and see nature at its best The Vegas Sign  Slot machines  Shows and Clubs are usually high priority on everyones todo list when visiting Vegas  Before you personally find out how the Sin got into Sin City consider checking out Red Rock Canyon   About 30 minutes from the strip  advance hiking skills not necessary  you can simple walk and take it all in  No matter what or who you may believe in  this beauty was created and wasnt man made ,?
129113,A welcoming shop!Friendly helpful service! Mid range quilting fabric  Store offers quilting classes of all types  Employees offer to help and explain about the classes offered  That friendly atmosphere makes for a positive visit ,?
129171,A well maintained diner for some amazing Thai food   Scores for the neat and organized ambience  service and courtesy  delicious taste and the quickness of serving food   This place is definitely atop my list for Asian flavors  !,?
130526,A work colleague showed me this place and I loved it! The holy chuck burger I had was fantastic  The meat was tender and the bun soft  The joint is a classic atmosphere  The coke machine that has a ton for different flavors is fun for anyone who has never used one before  I highly recommend this place  However  I had a milkshake after my meal which was worse then I expected after my great meal ,?
130885,A yummyin my tummy cozy spot! I met a friend for lunch here and was pleasantly surprised  The food is full of flavor and very reasonable  They give you huge portions  and the service is very friendly  I got a salad and the caprese bruchetta  What a perfect combo! The bold garlic taste of the bruschetta  washed down by a light salad  My salad had the perfect amount of dressing  I wish we had this place in So Cal  I would definitely come more often!,?
131207,A were quick to help me move the day I needed to move they were very professional an affordable an available in such short notice thanks again,?
131569,AMAZING  We went on Tuesday night and it was just us  made us feel a litter fancier  Definitely worth dressing up to the nines Gorgeous interior  and polite knowledgeable staff The food is all about experience  and did not disappoint  I think we ended u having 8 or 9 courses  The portions re super super small  the main and the dessert was just right  I was stuffed by the end ,?
133240,AC went out and Robert at ACE came right over  My house was 95 degrees so he offered me a stay at a hotel comped by ACE! Very cool  I needed a new unit and he thoroughly went over my options  Either fixing my old unit or getting a new one  After weighing my options a new unit was the best choice  Robert worked with his manager to get me some great discounts on a 14 Seer Bryant  I am very happy with Ace service and would highly recommend them ,?
133851,AJ will scam you out of your money  Please go to a different furniture store  He tried to forge my boyfriends signature for a financing company we were going to go through with and once I read all of the terms and conditions  we chose not to continue  AJ got mad and tried to submit it  This was a huge issue and I went down to the store and he ended up hitting me in my face  The cops were called and it was just a big ordeal  I would never trust him  This is not a place you want to do business with  Go to Pruitts!!!! Please,?
134281,ALSO! I just remembered the valet was full the night we went but we told the attendant we had bottle service at Hakkasan and so I gave her my name and she checked her ipad and then in in in we went! AWESOME ;]]],?
135253,AMAZING STAFF! Always happy but not overly fake happy  And their coffee is amazing  I have had friends tell me they dont like it because the drinks are too sweet  and I say to that  order it half sweet ,?
135837,AMAZING sales team! Not pushy at all  Everyone is friendly  fun and welcoming  They really take their time and utilize their knowledge with their customers  It made buying a new car a great experience   HUGE Thank you to Bobby  Bob  Tony  Ian  Tristan and the whole team for bending over backwards numerous times for us ,?
136299,AMAZING! Great food  service & drinks! Went with my vegetarian friend and we split a pancake flight (pb cup  chocolate chip and danish blueberry which was the fav) and a burrito with soyrizo  the mmm mosa and dirty drunk chai  Went on a Friday morning so only had a 10 min wait  recommend a week day if you can swing it!,?
136635,AMAZING! Very talented performer!Her crew is also very talented! She made great use of the small stage! This is an experience I will never forget!,?
136968,AMAZING!!!  Devin made the best pot stickers and fried rice tonight!!  Ill never go anywhere else to get those 2 things!!  I always get the snow blended raspberry strawberry drink but was out with the bestie looking for some good eats and she called Devin up placed our food order and when we got there we ordered our drinks and sat down and were served our food shortly there after  Devin your food rocks!!!!!,?
137090,AMAZING!!! Is the word the level of customer service  expertise  and cleanliness I have experienced with her!! My eyebrows look amazing!! And most importantly I HAVE EYEBROWS!!! Omg!! What a feeling!! Thank you thank you!!!,?
137331,AMAZING!!!!! The service was great  the food was sooooo good and it came out very fast  I had the chicken sausage gravy and biscuits with the potatoes  The food for the price is perfect!!!,?
137445,AMAZING My boyfriend and I stumbled upon this place for brunch after going to the Museum of Fine Arts  and we were not disappointed! We were sat immediately and ordered strawberry mimosas to drink  They were small  but very tasty! We both ordered the crepe and egg combo  I got a plain crepe with strawberries and over easy eggs  and he got a crepe with the works: hazelnut chocolate spread  banana  and strawberries  What we didnt know is these meals also came with toast  breakfast potatoes  and fresh fruit! We were also blown away when our server asked if we wanted freshly cracked pepper for our eggs!The waitstaff also allowed us to move to a different table when we were getting too hot sitting near the heater  The service was quick  accommodating  and very nice Decent prices for the amount of food  and how good the meal was  Overall  a very good experience! If we were ever in the area again  we would definitely return ,?
137549,AMAZING  Great prices and their Pad Thai and Green Curry get my seal of approval  Authentic and delicious :),?
137588,AMAZING  Ive recommended this place to so many people  Im not a huge fish & chips person in general but Ill go here time after time in a heartbeat  The fish is so perfectly cooked to a golden brown crisp  but the actual meat is so fresh and soft  The breading is everything  Its sweet  almost like the outer part of a deep fried oreo    yeah  Beautiful  The truffle fries are a really nice pairing as well  I always upgrade  As for sauce  I personally just prefer tarter since the rest of the food is already really flavorful  I would give this place 5 stars but I always struggle to find seating  so I get nervous to come here for fear of not getting a table right away ,?
137785,AMAzing location for a quick bite or to catch up with friends its lovely an they prices are so reasonable   really good crepes n sandwiches love it here best in eastside of town   highly recommend    ,?
137999,AN OK NIGHT OUT   I WOULD HAVE EXPECTED BETTERDate night was very nice because of my date but could have been better here  Unfortunately  at 730pm they had run out of 2 items on the menu that I was hoping to try so I went for a pasta dish It was only OK  I would be willing to try other things here but I think it just wasnt my night The one highlight was the greens and beans a old simple Italian classic with lots of flavor  I may try again but not anytime soon  With such a competitive food scene EVERYONE has to step up their game!,?
138150,APD has been great to me! They have shown their passion for paintball and for their customers by the way they treat others! They always take care of my needs and come through when I am needing guidance with my journey as a professional player! Matt is extremely awesome  Hes honest and he knows that paintball is a expensive sport but he always seems to be fair  Everyone should make this their goto store and cherish the good paintball fellowship that it holds ,?
139655,AVOID this place at all cost  Save your money and insurance  for somewhere else  Try clear vision eye centers  This place will charged you a certain amount at time of visit but  then weeks later they will send you an additional bill  The optometrist is sweet but the staff have no sense of customer service  I have had to contact the billing a few times with no response  January of 2015,?
139732,AVOID! Employ scammers! Longhauled from airport and I knew it as soon as I saw the tunnel  Called him out on it  and said oh its faster  the proceeded to drive like a maniac! Cost to Flamingo was $28 00   return to airport using different company as the usual way  $14 00,?
139848,AVOID   Their office is seriously screwed up   They will tell you the cost is X and then bill you for XXXX and refuse to honor their estimate   They do not honor what your insurance states you owe either   DO NOT GO THERE,?
140679,AWESOME!!!  Great deli and huge portions  Loved every bite  Our server Bambi made our lunch that much better  Worth stopping by!,?
141093,AWFUL!!The only thing worse than the service is the food  Overpriced bland food served by staff who would rather shoot the breeze with each other than actually wait tables  Because of the poor service  I left a small tip (I probably should have given nothing) and believe it or not  when I checked my credit card statement I noticed that the amount had been changed  I called the restaurant and after investigating  they confirmed that the waiter had actually crossed out the amount of the tip and written in another amount! Blatant theft and credit card fraud!If you go (which I wouldnt recommend)  pay with cash ,?
141633,AYCE was good last time  They changed ownership and stoped doing AYCE  Im sure regular menu is the same though ,?
142009,Aaaaaaamazing !!! Right on be corner  youve got to pay to park on the street but theres always empty spots  They sit you down as soon as possible  staff is amazing  food is bomb  comes fast and you can tell it was just made  Definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a great breakfast place downtown ,?
142902,Abosolutley fing terrible! They need to throw away the whole restaurant  We ordered steak and frites  the bacon burger  and the chicken Milanese with the mac n cheese and a coffee  The coffee came out cold  the chicken was super dry  the mac n cheese a child wouldnt eat  the burger was sweet and instead of the medium well steak we ordered it came medium rare  The french fries that were served had a half of a full potato in the bag (see photo) and it was under cooked  Dont waste your money or time ,?
144143,About time to update my review   This place still rocks!  One of the best steak places in Vegas  in my opinion   The table side Caesars salad is off the hook and the steaks are great   Service cant be beat  and the atmosphere was excellent   Keep up the fantastic work ,?
144815,Absolute BULLSHIT!!! We arrived at 835 pm  The sogn says they close at 10pm  There were TWO empty tables  We were told to wait  Tgen we were told to get out of the way and to sit in the wait to be seated chairs  Three servers were working  Yes it was very busy  But after we were told to wait  no one acknowledged us again  They proceeded to serve drinks to the seated customers  We waited for some acknowledgement  For a server to grab 2 menus and seat us  Nope  We decided to leave   there wasnt a single apology or protest  In fact it appeared they were glad to not have to seat or serve us  Seriously   if you are that busy and you cant manage   tell us when we first walk in that you will not be able to accomoodate us  Ignoring is rude and disrespectful  Absolutey horrible customer service  Im sure the people sitting and eating will disagree ,?
144840,Absolute FILTHY shit holeavoid it like the PLAGUE !!!!!!!Staff are all mindless nimrods!!!!!!This dump should be closed!!,?
145298,Absolute favorite restaurant in Charlotte! I order dinner from Pio Pio once a week  typically on Sundays and usually get takeout  After placing an order it is typically ready within 1020 minutes of the call  The food is absolutely amazing and the price point is unbeatable  My usual order is a whole rotisserie chicken  large rice and large beans  This order comes with two white sauce and two green sauce  I prefer the white sauce over the green sauce as the green sauce is very spicy  They have a small patio for outside dining and when I have eaten at the restaurant the service has always been great! Highly recommend! Authentic and delicious!,?
145332,Absolute four stars  Kensington is my mustgo place for relax  Thanks for the super convenient neighborhood  I could easily cityhike from china town to Spadina delight: Kensinton  And Fika  is the delightful stopby for quick coffee or afternoon break  They have my favorite scone  which always make me miss it when I have to take Timmies tea biscuit   They also serve very nice espresso  Find a sunny day in September before leaves all gone   knock in with your favorite books  enjoy treasuring moment in Fikas backyard ,?
145662,Absolute professionals ! Jason and Ray were on time  courteous and the job they completed was A  The guys only just left my place but I had to get a review up straight away to praise their work They mounted my 70 TV and hid all the cables and the only thing I am upset with is that I didnt call them earlier  I wont hesitate to recommend We Mount TVs to any friends and family  and will be looking forward to using them again in the future  10/10 !,?
145757,Absolute terrible service  Everybody was all over the place making a mess  Small line took for ever due to one person working while the other employees watched her  Employees lost my order then when going to remake the order tell me they are all out of some ingredients to fill the original order  Employee then gives me attitude and Did not even tell me sorry for there mistake  Very disgusted in this place ,?
145789,Absolute trash place  We called twice during the day to ask what the cover was and we were told free for ladies and $10 for guys  We made a reservation and confirmed it  We then called again before leaving the house and were told that the reservation is confirmed and the cover is the same  We arrive and the nasty girl at the door tells us that the cover JUST changed to $10 for girls & $20 for guys AND our reserved table is taken and they only have standing room the rest of the night  We drove 45 minutes to be told something opposing to what we were told multiple times the entire day  We were with a group of 5 so we were not about to pay $80 to get into a bar to stand  I will never return here and neither will anyone else I was with ,?
146108,Absolute worst service I have ever experienced  They even tell you they dont serve tap water so that they can charge for bottled water  They are rude and inattentive  I  would never come back  Wish i could give less than 1 star ,?
146672,Absolutely Delish  There is always a special happening which is wallet friendly  Only suggestion is more attentive staff  but the food is YUM YUM YUM YUM!!!!!,?
147631,Absolutely a MUST SEE!!! I would come again and again  Celine  Diana Ross  Cher  the list goes on  The performers are amazing and absolutely beautiful!!,?
147792,Absolutely a must try! 15 min drive from the strip but its worth it! The food is so tasty and service is amazing! Cest magnifique! Wish we knew about this place at the beginning of our trip ,?
148304,Absolutely amazing dealership! Management  sales  parts and service  Even the owner!We have two Toyotas now and I wouldnt think of taking them anywhere but Whitby    And were in Zephyr  so Newmarket is much closer  Huge shout outs to Miles  Gary  Steve and Jon  But seriously  anyone you deal with will treat you with a smile and a heap of respect  I cant say enough good about this team ,?
148420,Absolutely amazing experience  The food was great but even better was the service  Quality quality quality! Loooooovely waitresses   let me tell you ;) 100,?
149445,Absolutely amazing! Made my night special and a night to remember! Stunning view and delicious food  Felt a little rushed and wish you could hear the music when seeing the Bellagio fountains  Service was impeccable!,?
149510,Absolutely amazing! The flavors are all so unique and delicious and they are more than encouraging of you sampling any flavors youre interested in  The girl behind the counter was super cheerful and patient with us  The outdoor patio is a fun setup to enjoy your ice cream on as well  I am kicking myself for not getting here sooner!,?
149898,Absolutely amazing   Very rarely will a meal render me speechless   I truly appreciated the uniqueness and overall quality off the food  not to mention the creative plating   The mashed potatoes were by far the best Ive ever eaten   The prices are very reasonable as well   This is truly a gem of Las Vegas   Fine dining brought to a tavern with a very eclectic menu   Safe to say after one meal that I will be a regular   Chef Carlos you rock!,?
150024,Absolutely amazing  Id be obese if I lived any closer because I would eat here everyday if I could ,?
150043,Absolutely amazing  Its a very cozy  inviting environment with fantastic service They have a great selection of beer and theyre more than willing to talk you through the process if your palette is in the mood for something specific You are doing yourself a grave injustice if you just go here for some drinks  though  Selfservice peanuts and popcorn are in the back  its a lot more sanitary than the typical stuff sitting on the counters in dive bars across Pittsburgh  Zamir  the owner  is legitimately the most personable guy Ive ever met in the bar scene  The guy genuinely cares about the experience hes providing for you  especially with his food  Everything he creates is right behind the bar freshly and carefully prepared  If you like any type of Middle Eastern / Mediterranean food including hummus  falafel  or gyro  this is the place to get it  If its not on the menu  you can request golani which is a spinach patty on a bed of lettuce  Its to die for ,?
150173,Absolutely amazing  We both had chicken gyros  They were delicious and I appreciate the extra sauce  The fries were amazing my wife said I think these might be the best fries Ive ever had in my life  Were a little snobby about food but this place is incredible  Ill be back! And great customer service ,?
150647,Absolutely awesome  This is not some cheap pizza joint  An almost overwhelming menu full of many many choices  Not the cheapest but definitely the best ,?
150910,Absolutely awful  Stopped here for a late dinner with a group of four  and waited over an hour for our food  The place wasnt busy  and we were finally given the explanation of there being just one person in the kitchen after waiting  ignored  for an hour  When the food finally graced us with its presence  it was in the form of a charred  inedible pizza and an utterly tasteless risotto  One member of our party ordered the Caprese salad and was informed only when the other food was delivered that the kitchen was out of tomatoes  After waiting OVER AN HOUR for the food with no apology whatsoever  to be informed that the salad was unable to be made is unacceptable  Our server  Christopher  was inattentive and smarmy  He blamed the kitchen for the delay and the kitchen blamed him  There was a bug in my wine and I was shorted change back upon payment  His parting words as we left  Sorry we failed so hard tonight  Sorry we wasted our evening and our money  and ended up at Taco Bell ,?
151210,Absolutely best donut shop in Las Vegas  Owner is so nice and literally these donuts melt in my mouth!!!,?
151229,Absolutely best location  very nice environment  We payed more than $100 for two pastas  one beer and one red wine at a Wednesday night  For this price I wish my scallops are bigger than just as some pea size pieces  Good pasta shouldnt be that salty in my opinion  If they improve their food quality  I am sure they will get more returning customers in the future ,?
151360,Absolutely brilliant Everything about the show was stellar  Bob Anderson is incredible both visually and sonically  And the way in which he combines each aspect into the the overall performance is superb Couple all of that with Franks piano and band man Vincent Falcone and a top notch 32 piece band and you have a show that simply must be seen ,?
151412,Absolutely charming and delicious  perfect for a morning brunch  nice lunch and even an afternoon wine with a pastry  The crowd is nice yet not uptight and its also located in the nicest part of the city  Mustdo ,?
151517,Absolutely delicious 2 item lunch special  I got kung pao beef and yellow chicken curry  spicy level #8! Comes w a huge dollop of white rice  smal cup of soup and choice of appetizer  I got a wonton  all for only #7 95! Plus  they are offering 7% cash back through Yelp  by signing up one of your credit cards  then  all you have to do  is use it there  and Yelp credits you back 7% of your bill  Highly recommended  Great flavors ,?
151903,Absolutely delicious food! Ordered a cod sandwich  received enough fish for 2 sandwiches! Homemade French fries and chips were amazing  The onion ring appetizer was an entree in itself  My husband ordered an ultimate burger and proclaimed it the best burger hed ever had  Love the atmosphere ,?
152848,Absolutely delicious!!! Fast service and home cooked dinner  sever was nice and precise  love the cause of the restaurant  will definitely come back in the near future ,?
153121,Absolutely delicious  Everything for dinner is just wonderful  I had the spaghetti al limone  tender  sweet shrimp in a light cream sauce  At first the pasta seemed a little underdone but then the cream sauce just soaked in and it became perfect  My husband had the Octopus pasta  which is VERY strongly flavored with the Uni sauce  but was also delicious  The whipped ricotta appetizer was creamy and perfect and probably would be a perfect dessert even  it was so rich!The only minor  MINOR complaint I had was that the tiramisu is extremely strong on the espresso flavor and was lacking in creaminess; it was a little grainy  But I still enjoyed it and the Amaro selection that our server helped us with was perfection  I wouldnt have known how to pick an afterdinner Amaro without his help  but I LOVED the one I got  and my husband loved his as well Well be back for brunch!,?
153360,Absolutely delicious  Wonderful baba  bread  and the lamb kofte adana were favorites  but all entrees were delicious  Im an east sider so wish I cold get here more often  but best persian food Ive had in Cleveland and anywhere else  Beautiful decor and service was very attentive ,?
153613,Absolutely disgusting and horribly overpriced  The flavor was bad  The chili was gross  Ended up throwing the food away  after wasting $20  The guy with cane is RUDE  I do not recommend this carter save your money Yuck!,?
153703,Absolutely disgusting! Worst sushi I ever had  These people should be ashamed for serving that kind of garbage to customers  Chopped tuna sushi was repulsive  Tasted as spoiled tuna covered with sauce that was horrible    Salmon roll had salmon that had skin and huge white fat veins    This usually gets cut off and not served  Avocado roll had pieces of Avocado skin inside and Avocado was half brown    Tasted horrible  Unagi roll was just a mess of eil fat and skin  Everything was horrible    Nothing good to say about this place    Avoid ,?
153707,Absolutely disgusting!! The manager said oh thats not grease on the table  He tried to say thats the way the tables are made ,?
154098,Absolutely excellent  Chef Lucky Thai (thats her actual name!) was professional  friendly and had excellent skills! The food she prepared was delicious and plentiful  definitely perfect for parties  She will go to your location (ours was in a suite in Vegas) and set up everything from beginning to end  Multiple dishes and reasonably priced  Would definitely recommend her and will use her again!,?
154369,Absolutely fabulous  Was there twice in two days  One  dinner  We had chicken livers and French buns for appetizers  and walleye and burger for main course  The cocktails were very good too  Sunday brunch was amazing too  We were four people  We had Bloody Mary  smoothie  mimosa and bellini  then fish sandwich  chopped salad  burger and Cesar salad  Soooooo good  I have not lived in Cleveland for 12 years  and was so happy to find the Fire!,?
154727,Absolutely fantastic salon! Cynthia was very great with her suggestions about how to style the classic side part style i was going for  The inside is very nice and clean  and ALL the stylist inside are very friendly and helpful  Normally ive been very nervous in the past with getting my haircut professionally since i have a birthmark on the right side of my head  but Cynthia made me feel extremely comfortable the entire time by assuring me it was no big deal  and just general small talk  I would highly recommend everyone go see Cynthia!,?
156214,Absolutely horrible food and experience  Weak drinks  over salted everything  rubbery meat  slow service  If you are in desperate need of an alcoholic drink  then buy it here   But  go to Burger King next door if youre hungry ,?
156503,Absolutely horrible we have been in this house for 5 months and nothing on our original walk through has been completed we called about 6 times and used their online system several times and nothing gave them a list again a couple weeks ago when we dropped off rent and was told to call their maintenance guy hadnt called because of starting a new job and Linda has the nerve to call today and tell us with an attitude that we have 24 hours to contact him or we will have to pay for everything thats broke and missing       call the guy and he lied and said he has stopped by our house several times and called my number a bunch of times a number they dont have then after we agree to have him come Monday he tells me to call him Sunday and remind him      this place is a joke go elsewhere I know we will be,?
157048,Absolutely incredible Ethiopian food  The flavor was delicious  the portions were huge  and the price was so low my wallet cried tears of joy Also the injera was so soft and fluffy and perfect that I used it as a sleeping bag and took a nap right on my plate ,?
157158,Absolutely incredible neighborhood restaurant    Very friendly and food is out of this world   Best ceviche I have ever had and you can design your own  octopus/shrimp with a slight mango flavor and incredible heat like nothing Ive ever seen    Great paella  authentic South American drinks  and lots of fun ,?
157171,Absolutely incredible place  Ive been twice in 3 days  They have the best sandwich Ive ever had  the white bbq pork sandwich and their spaghetti sandwich might just be the second best Ive had! The friendliest staff around  a great family atmosphere and probably the best chocolate chip cookie Ive ever had too! Will definitely be coming here very often and if youre nearby make sure you stop by and try it  you will not regret it!,?
157863,Absolutely love it here  Im a Vegas local and I usually come for a couple day staycation every few weeks  Friendly staff  nice clean rooms  and fairly priced ,?
158320,Absolutely love the place   Delicious waffles  And the I ed coffee too  Our favorite place  Make sure to visit,?
158695,Absolutely love this hotel  I dont think I have come across one rude staff member  Special shout out to Ryder (lifeguard) at the pool who helped my son getting a life vest for the pool  Rooms are very nice  Especially the pillows  Minus one star for how expensive everything is in this hotel  $11 for a store bought sandwich that tasted like doodie  Would most definitely stay here again  Just gotta save all my pennies  Or win the lotto ,?
158737,Absolutely love this location! I work in the same complex  so II here about 5 times a week  On top of the subs being tasty  the staff is super friendly and welcoming  They even greet me by name and have my order memorized! 5 stars all around,?
158964,Absolutely love this place for our kids! We visit at least once a week just wish it was a bit cheaper ,?
159087,Absolutely love this place! A girlfriend brought me here and they were so friendly and fun to chat with  They also have this awesome Hologram color that is so fabulous  I loved how it turned out  Its very clean and neat here  they took their time to do a great job but finished faster than I expected  I love how they are detail oriented and do things right as opposed to just rushing to get the job done  Highly recommend this place!,?
159622,Absolutely love this place! They offer a special fairly often $99 for a one hour massage and one hour facial  Today I had Candace give me the massage and Christine perform my facial  and both were incredible  My favorite was definitely the massage Candace talked me through what some of the issues I was experiencing are and gave me good advice on some adjustments to make to my diet footwear to help with my personal issues  The atmosphere is always great  playing light spa music and dark rooms with comfy robes and sheets ,?
159733,Absolutely love this place!! Reminds me of South Korea  Great food and atmosphere! Love the service  We have made this a spot we come to several times per month  Everytime  we come its alway amazing service and food! Our kids love Cindy and hug her when the my see her and she treats us like family ,?
159898,Absolutely love this place  since we are from Louisiana  and we know how to appreciate good seafood  Food tastes like it is cooked at home  with love  Staff and customers are always friendly  Customers happy to be in a Louisiana environment  Lola is a doll! Friendly and energetic and wants to please her customers ,?
160427,Absolutely love this place  The food is great and the staff is very nice  Its just a fun dining experience! Another Sam Fox success!,?
160549,Absolutely love this place  We had dinner here on Christmas Eve   The restaurant is charming  a little bit of old Vegas  The food is always delicious and our waiter Rene is the best   Franco was very accommodating seating us where we preferred and Ben is a wonderful  host   Looking forward to going back again soon ,?
161151,Absolutely loved my experience   My hair was cut and styled by Tina (Tiny) and she gave me a precision cut with ultimate results! I couldnt love my hair more   Im looking forward to returning  Thanks Tina!Enjoyed chatting with the salon team  They were friendly  professional and I even got to witness their hearts in motion ,?
161425,Absolutely loved their service  atmosphere  dinner and drinks! Their prices are definitely worth the visits! I do want to mention that the day we went to dinner  which was a Saturday night  their air conditioner was somewhat high  so I asked the young lady that was taking care of us if they could turn down the air a little bit  and she came with a black chal to help me stay warm! I absolutely did not expect that  but that was super sweet and thoughtful! That deserves a 10star rating! Loved it! Highly recommend!,?
161645,Absolutely loved this place!! The decor is so pretty full of lights  and the food is AMAZING!! Perfect for a date or even for a girls get together  I had the smoked brisket sandwich  and I have to say  it was the best sandwich I have EVER had  I highly recommend you guys try it  We also got appetizers for the table  and the corn with bacon was good too  Friends had other dishes  and everyone raved about the food  so this place is consistently good  Jus delicious  Wont be disappointed  Pretty place with good food ,?
162598,Absolutely one of the best Football Stadiums in the Country  The food is good not great  the food at the Levi Stadium is the great  The big screen TVs here are the best  The TVs at the MBZ Super Dome are the worst  The way the roof opens and how the grass field rolls out is absolutely state of the art  Ive been to almost a dozen NFL stadiums and nothing compares to this place  Our seats were great  4th floor row A & B  Even if you have to buy nose bleed seats just stay low and they will be good  Parking kind of sucked  like any stadium that doesnt have trains and or a lite rail system  My son and I are trying to go to all NFL Stadiums by the time I turn 50  its not cheap but its a lot of fun  Levi Stadium and the University of Phoenix Stadium are the only two so far that I hope to visit again soon!,?
162952,Absolutely outstanding! This was unquestionably the best meal we have had in the Phoenix area   We were warmly greeted by Jessica  Oscars (the owner) goddaughter  Jessica was friendly  attentive and a pleasure to speak with  We ordered the lomo saltado and the pollo a la brasa  Both were excellent  We have had Peruvian food in our home town of New York and this was as good as gets  We strongly recommend Andes Peruvian  You wont regret it ,?
163794,Absolutely stunning hotel  Beautiful pool  lots of awesome shops  great restaurants and it smells amazing when you walk into the casino  Lots of new slots and you just feel fancy when playing table games  Drinks are delicious and although pricey but worth it  The pool area is relaxing and clean although I think they need more room between the lounge chairs and the pool area  Pool food is expensive but very large portions and tasty ,?
166234,Absolutely the chillest spot in Vegas! Bartenders  drinks  music  and of course sexy Stacy! Mojitos  Moscow Mules  and The Last Words were all banging drinks  those bartenders hooked me up  This will be my first stop next time Im in Sin City ,?
166242,Absolutely the fastest most attentive team of technicians available in Las Vegas  Clean cut  professional  knowledgeable  understanding and straight to the point  Called this company to look at a drain that backed up  They had the technology to temporarily fix the problem but recommended replacing some drain pipes  They cleared the clog and left for minimal charges  Months later  hired them when my rental was vacant to reassess the condition of the pipes and we opted to replace all plumbing  THEY WERE SPOT ON!!! The pipes underground were rotten  Thank goodness they suggested replacement  Full service !!! Jackhammer  backfill  concrete  drywall  paint and the works  Very happy with the service  Highly recommend them ,?
166415,Absolutely the only place i would get a banh mi in my dear town of Las Vegas  Dont count on a 5 star dinning experience though  this is just your usual grab and go asian joint  DAKAO is the epitome of your tasteful mom and pop shop  a damn hole in the wall that could use some aesthetic remodeling but thats definitely irrelevant to the product delivered! My usual is the dac biet  the number 1  The bread is flaky yet never dry! Im especially particular when it comes to bread  In comparison to the much overrated Lees sandwiches whose bread is super hard and dry! This places bread is fresh flaky and moist on the inside  I mean cmon isnt it safe to say the essence of the Banh Mi lies within the consistency and texture of the bread?! The only unkudos for this place (hence the 4 vs 5 stars) is that i wish theyd give more meat  theyre a little stingy with their meat but thatll never stop me from detouring here for my Banh mi cravings! Enjoy everyone! :),?
166774,Absolutely the worst customer service  I took my daughter in for her senior photos as required by her school  We had an appointment and over an hour later they took her back  Then said we could choose the photo online but hat would be a $40 charge (a credit if you purchase the senior photo) or free if you come back in a week  Im sure Ill have to wait for that as well ,?
168317,Absolutely worth the wait! Excellent service and friendly!Had superfruit antioxidant drink and WOW! Burgers are amazing and huge! Definitely add  onion rings to your meal    Love love this place!,?
169161,Accidentally booked but the place was gross so we didnt stay yet they still charged  I explained it was an accident and then we thought we would give them a chance but the room smelt funny  several drug addicts were lingering outside the room & the stand up shower was peeling and moldy  Do not book this place  for $30 more you can get a very nice hotel with no mold  no addicts hanging out and a pleasant experience ,?
169230,Accidentally ordered from this location at 9225 Mentor Ave when I usually order from another store(which is awesome)  Walked in and no one around  Finally  a little punk came around and said  Juuust waaait  one minute  Im helppping sooooomeooone  Then Shaggy came up and finally gave me my order  And the pizzas were poorly made and not even cut correctly ,?
169267,Accidentally stumbled on this place  The pork buns and crispy tofu I had were fantastic  The outside seating is nice with lots of greenery ,?
170441,Actually a pretty good place for an airport place  I got coffee and a slice of tiramisu  Both pretty good  Will stop here again when I travel through next time,?
170542,Actually found this place by accident last week  was actually trying to go to the Hash House a Go Go that is off the strip  but being the unobservant person I am I read the name wrong ended up here We decided to give it a shot since we were all starving  initially I regretted the decision because it took forver for our order to be taken and the food to come  but once it did it was SO delicious and fresh! I really liked that if what you wanted was not already a combo on the menu they were willing to create a combo for you (i e  instead of the 4 pancakes by themselves you could get 2 with whatever side)  The waitress was really nice and continued to check on us throughout the meal  Everyone was pleased with their meal and while the portion size was not as large as HHGG the quality was much better ,?
171553,Adams availability of companies saves me money  His New Yorker character gives me the straight talk Im looking for  PS  Availability to answer calls after 5pm and weekends is amazing  Thanks for all your hard work over the years ,?
171741,Added Yelp just to write this review  I live about 10 minutes away so i got the 29 95 per month package which includes a parking pass  Great deal?? NOPE  It can only be used from 68am and after 5 (which the garage is lease only until at least 7 every night if not later)   So basically i belong to a gym that basically i can never use when is convenient and half the time i go the garage is full and i have to drive around finding something or just give up,?
172219,Adequate pizza in a land of pizza philistines Im from Chicago originally and Im an unapologetic pizza snob  Chicago pizza is the best you lose get over it That said  Ive eaten at Metro Pizza with friends a few times and I can say if you cant get real Chicago style pizza  the Metro pie will do in a pinch I get it with pepperoni on the thicker Metro crust and tell them to leave it in a few minutes extra  I like my cheese browned a bit on top Its pretty generic or Sbarroesque as another reviewer said (love that description by the way) but its still head and shoulders above the crap they sling out of pizza hut and dominoes or the king of craptastic pizzas Little Caesars Also  weve always had great waitress service there which is amazing compared to the usual level of service Ive come to expect in Vegas 3 stars for an adequate pie and above average service ,?
172254,Aderra is a great location and the grounds are improving with the new management hired    Things are getting fix and improved to make Aderra one of the more upscale condos in the area ,?
172665,Adobada tacos  SOOOO GOOD! No visit to Vegas is complete without a visit or two to this wonderful establishment  The food here is good any time of the day  breakfast  lunch  dinner  late night snack  You order at each station (they all specialize in one/two types of meat)  You get your food and pay at the cashier  The first time we went  it was empty and we were confused so the nice ladies walked us through the entire process very patiently I will always make sure to make a visit here every time I visit Vegas  This place is THAT GOOD!,?
173952,Aesthetically pleasing cafe  Its nice to come here and listen to music in my native tongue while sipping on a tasty Pistachio Frappe or Latte  Not too much of a fan of their coffees  but their teas and lattes are quite nice  When I do need a coffee fix  I opt for Pistachio latte with a shot of espresso  as recommended by a buddy  Service is great  guys behind bar answers your questions  Music is very cafeesque  a mix of English and Korean  A little too loud if youre trying to study  so I would recommend for more casual hangouts ,?
175067,After 2 other companies failing us  and a short stint of trying to do it ourselves  we called Bulwark  They said they would be at my house between 10A12P  They arrived right on time & got right to work I liked that he sprayed the perimeter of my yard   not just the perimeter of my house  and the tech (Billy McAlpine) saturated my yard  Bugs that were underground were coming out to get away and dying right before our very eyes (LOL)  I havent seen ANYTHING in my yard since even at night He  also  sprayed inside the house & removed outlet covers on the 1st floor to drop poison there as well! No other company has ever done this  He scheduled a time to come back in a week to make sure we were satisfied Their products are safe for pets & for a 2300 sqft house they charges $100 for th initial visit & going forward it is $69 every other month If you are having any pest problems call Bulwark!!!,?
175100,After 2 weeks my nails are still perfect   :) they look amazing cute design I will definitely go back to them !!,?
175507,After 4 years of bad haircuts from franchised haircut stores (ex  First Choice and GreatClips) I finally decided it was time to find myself a Barber  I decided to go to I Barbieri after reading such great reviews  I didnt make an appointment and showed up 30 mins before closing and was greeted with a firm handshake   I told Ando the haircut I wanted but my hair wasnt long enough in some parts due to a previous bad cut  He cut my hair great in the original style I wanted when I got the bad haircut and I will definitely be back once my hair grows for the style I wanted  We had a pleasant conversation and he tailored my haircut to fit my hair type and cut my hair to my exact requests  Only thing I was disappointed in was not getting a complementary espresso after expecting it from reading the reviews but Im not complaining as I showed up 30 mins before closing without an appointment  Will definitely return again as Ando is now my favorite Barber ,?
176992,After a bit of driving and shopping around     we found a set of 4 used tires here at a better price than anywhere else we went ,?
177080,After a busy day  we decided to give the new Captain Robins Restaurant a try  The friendly atmosphere ushers us right in the door! A smiling server directs us to a table  We sure didnt have to wait very long! (To be fair  it was 430 pm) Piping hot food arrived  the Reuban sandwich was huge  tasty and disappeared quickly after it was served to my husband  He shared an onion ring  and as far as good onion rings go  these were amazing! Next  my choice was the heaped high country (breakfast)  skillet  This was a real treat  reminding me of a favourite skillet at a friends restaurant back in Saskatchewan! We will become regulars after having had their great comfort food today! Great food at a reasonable price  happy customers!Our neighbourhood needed a relaxed restaurant  and we finally got it!!,?
177325,After a coworker found this on yelp and tasted the steak and eggs  I felt I had to try this place  One word comes to mind: impressive  A very warm and inviting atmosphere with a good view of the casino  Its a casual dinner witch is always a plus and also does room service for the hotel  Avoid alacarte items as these appeared a little heavy to me for a dinner  However the special menus(daily and lunch were VERY attractive The prime rib was sensational  Something Id expect out of a higher end steak house  I asked for it rare and got it that way which was very pleasing  The horseradish was a nice balance of spivey and flavor  The greens and mashed potatoes were fresh and cooked just right  The service was just as good as the food and Ill probably be back a few more times this week!,?
178184,After a friend recommended this place a few months ago  I finally got around to picking some food up from here  I called them 3 times and they ended up calling me back right away  Made an order an hr ahead and still had to wait an extra 15 minutes for our food  This place is BUSY  but for good reason  Tried their char kuey teow and curry laksa  Both dishes were HUGE portions and delicious! I loved the smokey wok flavour in the char kuey teow  I will definitely be coming back here to try some other dishes!,?
179881,After a long wait (no reservations for parties less than 6) on the comfortable patio  we enjoyed the bacon jam and chicken skins  Great beer selection  The stroganof  tacos  and NY Strip Steak were delicious  Pretty high prices for such small portions  I would try it again  but not very often due to the cost ,?
179911,After a long wait  we got in but the choice wasnt great  The price was a whopping 38 instead of the advertised 30  The decor is clean but the place is under staffed  The main highlight  snow crab was half frozen ,?
180167,After a mixup with our reservation and all the rooms being sold out Jessica Martinez and Wendy at the front Desk were extremely helpful and friendly and resolved the situation expertly  Fantastic staff,?
181250,After a terrible experience at CVS  I stopped in to get my prescription filled here today in hope I could get back to work quickly  The staff were gracious and the service was great  Thank you for making it easy on an otherwise difficult day for me ,?
182247,After all the hype from friends about how great this place was  my Saturday dinner buffet  as far as the food was concerned  they were a total disappointment  I tried a little bit of everything  they all come in small dishes anyways  but ALL the food were either too salty or too sweet  I am not talking about typical American restaurant food saltines level  the dishes were like double to sometime triple those saltiness  Yes  I drank a couple glasses of water plus another big glass of lemonade  When the food were not salty  they were mostly on the sweet side  I had to take a second look at my various salads to make sure they werent dessert items  As far as selection goes  very little seafood  primarily your typical snow crab legs; lots of chicken variations; very chewy Prime Rib; very limited sushi selection; and overly sweet desserts  Will I go back  definitely not  Will I go back if its free? Not if they are still serving the same food ,?
183433,After balling it up at the Sky Lofts at the MGM the last time I came to Vegas  I was afraid that I would be too jaded and unsatisfied with any other hotel  I definitely did not feel that way when I stayed at The Venetian  I love that it is suite style which definitely makes it easier to have a few extra guests  The beds are super comfy and the sofa actually pulls out into a bed which gave our 5th guest a good place to sleep  I guess the room is kind of expensive at around $200 a night  but if you split it between a few people its not so bad  I also love the fact that they play music from Phantom here in the elevators Also  you must pay a visit to their pool  Tao beach and the shallow pool with chairs in the middle make for a perfect place to get that tan!,?
183468,After bed experience in 2012 and avoiding this place for about 2 years  decided to give another shit  was pleasantly surprised with changes  very nice menu with good choices in sushi tools as well as main dishes  after several visits looks like they now take service mostly better than before  waiters has no ledge about dishes and special and more available than in my first experience overload good dinning choice for average bill 5060  dollars per person,?
184392,After being to Lawreys and leaving disappointed (Ill tear them a new one after completing this)  I was kinda skeptical to try another LV steakhouse   But being a fan of Top Chef  I figured I gotta see whats up w/ Colicchio (sp?) Luckily we were there for Restaurant Week so we did their special menu that came with a bunch of sides and 3 different cuts of steak   We also ordered their yukon gold puree w/ truffle oil   Cant go wrong with that  2 of my favs yukon gold & truffle oil in one dish?!  More please!  :)Everything was good  including the steak   I guess I was expecting GREAT steak and so was a little disappointed   I must say the portions were good and everything was definitely worth the price (mind you  it was a discounted price for restaurant week)   Other than the puree  nothing exceptionally special   Id go back  but its not at the top of my list for Vegas ,?
185068,After car shopping all day  my boyfriend and I wanted to have a nice relaxing dinner  I got the rueben sandwich and it was the best rueben I ever had  My boyfriend thought his shrimp pasta was subpar  Our waitress was very friendly and attentive  we never had an empty drink  However  we were the only ones in the restaurant without a bottle of wine at the table so when I saw the manager touch every table besides ours I was baffled! Even when she dropped our food off it was awkward and we seemed unwelcome  We will not return and will not be telling our friends about it because they probably wouldnt be welcomed either  We are a younger couple so maybe we looked like we didnt belong but I work in the restaurant business and we both know how to appropriately tip! I feel bad for the waitress because a lot of guests would lower their tip because of this  But she was awesome and got over a 20% tip  Kudos to her for being appropriately trained!,?
185384,After close to a 2 month wait  Jiro style omakase dinner was nothing short of amazing  It was a theatrical experience  Chef Yasu is definitely giving my alltime favourite  Sushi Kaji a run for the title  Best Sushi Restaurant in Toronto  Without the time to travel the world for good sushi  this is the next best thing  IMO  Fresh fish and seafood that Ive never had the chance to try from all over the world; Japan  Spain  Boston  Alaska  Norway  Beirut  and Vancouver  Our favourites were the scallops and sea urchin from Japan! Heaven All of this for $80 per person  which includes 16 18 pieces of sushi plus dessert  A deal if you ask me Note: After the meal  you have the chance to order more  Our scallops and uni sushi were $16 a piece Reservations: A mustParking:  Street parkingHours: 6:00 PM  11:00 PM,?
185602,After coming here just once I completely get why Tony has so many great reviews  Attention to customer service and pride in what you do goes a very long way  Tony was charming  beard trim looked great  and its always s good thing supporting small local business ,?
185838,After consistently crappy experiences at Williams Sonoma  I came here  I dropped a considerable chunk of money on a Breville machine  accessories and a few other items Needless to say  I was informed throughout the entire purchase and felt my money was appreciated  I was greeted with a smile and no one even mentioned I was there after closing  I love this place Every weird gadget you could imagine plus every vanity item you could ever crave I will be back  Enough with those snotty competitors ,?
186273,After dining at Jamies Union Jacks at Covent Garden  London our expectations were similar from Jamies Italian  The place offers a super ambience with awesome customer service  The food was also good  which we expected it to be excellent  I liked the porcini fettuccine  Spaghetti Carbonara was like any other home made dish  However please try to orange blossom polenta cake which was outstanding  Id definitely go back to Jamies Italian to try some of their other dishes  Cheers,?
186787,After doing some research  this place seemed like the best place to get a piercing   Scott is very knowledgeable and answered every question I had  He was professional and polite  I would recommend him!!!!,?
186889,After driving 9 hours I stayed at the hotel across the street and just walked here  We were seated immediately but had to wait over 45 minutes for a chef to begin  Normally you get Miso soup at a Japanese restaurant  here you get chicken broth  Then salad and whatever else you may order from the hibachi  While the steak  chicken and shrimp were delicious  the fried rice was very bland and grilled veggies were mainly onions  zucchini and mushrooms  Within 15 minutes of finishing the meal we ran back to the hotel to fight over the bathroom  You can figure out the rest ,?
187068,After driving by this place on numerous occasions ( when it was a diner)  finally decided to stop in  Im glad I did! The place itself is clean and open  The staff is very friendly and knowledgeable  The food itself was quite good  We shared the roasted chicken as the portions were big enough  This also came with two sides  we got the ( devil eggs  cabbage)  All of it was amazing  Look out for the daily specials the buttermilk fried chicken wings are amazing!It would have been nice if the sides were a bit bigger  as it is on the pricey side Other than that  would go again for sure!,?
187733,After eating the buffet at Ceasars anything would be a hard act to follow   The food was not too bad for the price was not equal for its value   They had unlimited house wine and a couple of beers to choose from   The had a decent selection and the servers were nice   We ate there around noon on a weekday   I hear their brunch is better on the weekend   I would say this was an overall average buffet experience   Not bad but not exceptional ,?
187765,After eating tons of fatty  fried  and overly rich meals around the strip I was desperate to find a somewhat healthier option  Earl of Sandwich offered an affordable and delightfully healthy Greek salad to help offset all the burgers and tacos I had been consuming The salad itself had big chunks of feta cheese and a great  tangy Greek dressing  My only gripe was that the salad itself was on the smaller side  and didnt have as much grilled chicken in it as I would have hoped ,?
188385,After finishing a very long shift at work  I was famished and wrestling with one of my rare cravings for red meat  My boyfriend  with the aid of the mighty internet  discovered this place nearby Whatever the seasonal game steak is  GET IT! I ordered the bison steak cooked to medium rare; it came out closer to medium but was so tender and perfectly seasoned that it didnt matter one bit My boyfriend got the 3 brats  Typically  I despise them but these were made of 3 types of game meat and  delicious!We finished with the cronuts (basically croissant donuts) which were recommended by our waitress  They were pleasantly light  sweet  and perfect after finishing my entire plate Prepare yourself for an audio/visual sports onslaught  Big screen TVs everywhere and quite noisy  I was glad it wasnt a busy night because thats not really my speed but  the food was too good for me to leave anything less than 5 stars ,?
188520,After forty years of working side by side  Penn and Teller know how to do magic  They are funny  engaging and  well  magical  They change their tricks and routine often  so chances are youre always in for something completely new  Flying doves  matching love cards  floating balls and more  For a 90minute show  it was fast paced and had high audience involvement  No seat is a bad seat  We purchased mezzanine level and thought that was perfect  The incline between rows ensures everyone can see  too  Best of all  at the end of the show they are available for pictures  which we LOVED  I would come back every time Im in Vegas for sure :),?
190050,After growing out my brows from a bad threading experience previously I was a little cautious coming here  I was so happy with the result  Farida does a awesome job!,?
190925,After having gone for the second time last night  I figured it was high time I get in here and talk up the Parmesan Crusted Chicken Ive had both times   The white cheddar mashed potatoes are worth an order of this dish!  Get yourself the Chocolate Raspberry combo drink with some stout and raspberry beer (I cant find it on their online menu  but check it out for sure)   It doesnt matter how many people have already said it   their pizookies need to happen at the end of your meal!  The peanut butter is always my first choice but their fancy salted caramel pizookie is good too   We got the trio this time around and shared different bites with the whole table   if youre okay with sharing  this is definitely the way to go ,?
190973,After having had some underwhelming meals at our hotel and around the convention district  this place was a BIG treat  The service was spot on  and we knew the meal was going to be good as soon as they brought out their special mixed chips and dark  smoky salsa  After our margaritas appeared (their special margaritas come out with a refill in the shaker)  our entrees did not disappoint  Hearty chicken in the enchiladas and quesadilla  and our friends intriguing naked chili relleno  Portions were beyond generous  and thanks to checking in with Yelp we shared a dessert for free  We chose the banana burrito and had no regrets  Highly recommended  Sad that I wont be back in Phoenix any time soon  Id definitely come back if this were in my city!!,?
191052,After having lunch I figured it could be timed for dessert  The selection on pastries and cookies is so extensive here and makes for better moods  I know that sugar is bad for you  but when life deals lemons eat chocolate it makes it better  The staff here is so helpful despite the machines that they are being replaced with machines for ordering  The new ordering technologies that they are using are very easy to use and more accurate than the human staff sometimes  You have to be the judge if that ,?
191055,After having lunch and doing some errands  my wife and I stopped by to try the goodies  The store owner was already helping another person who had heard about this place on Yelp   I think he got some poke  not sure if he got some sweets   Well my wife decided on a piece of guava cake and I got some cream puffs to try later on  We also picked up some pork hash  Dinner time here it comes!!So just as we are leaving out came the malasadas  Plain and red velvet  Still full from lunch and having gotten desserts for later tonight  I just had to try a single malasadas  Got the red velvet with chat illy cream  The wife and I thought that it was so delicious   Thank goodness that we dont live in the area because I would weigh a ton and end up with diabetes   The one bite alone told me that the other stuff I bought was going to be great  Will have to go back to the the poke and to add to this review ,?
191335,After having some free time after a doctors appointment I came here to relax and get a pedicure  The facility is very bright and clean  The chairs werent like your typical salon where they can recline and adjust  it was like a bench with little cubbies where you sit and put your stuff  There was a vibration setting but no massage on the chair  Isnt of grabbing a polish  they hand you a book which eliminates the chance of missing that perfect polish because someone else has it  I felt like the prices were a little pricey but you got to pick which scent of bath bomb and scrub was used which was a unique touch ,?
191446,After having the run around from the customer service line  we came into store    Mei was so helpful with the process   She spoke to customer service herself to try and get situation resolved     Great service from her and her manager Jie ,?
193101,After hunting around for places which sold the newest addition to the So Delicious frozen dessert (aka vegan ice cream) selection  I found it here! They have all of the So Delicious Cashew Milk vegan ice cream flavors: Salted Caramel  Snickerdoodle  Dark Chocolate Truffle  and a Cappuccino flavor  There were no Salted Caramel in their freezer case and the worker pleasantly obliged my request to look in the back for more  She returned with my treasured Salted Caramel in tow!Awesome employees  The parking lot is a little crazy at this location but its not unbearable ,?
193464,After leaving Korea I began to crave the food   This place is as authentic as it gets without being in Korea   No Soju  but bring your own   Classic Kimchi and other Kimchis are all top notch  as is everything else   Try Kimchi Chigae    Go if you havent  you are really missing out ,?
193501,After leaving a disappointing dinner we stumbled upon this place on the way back to our hotel  We ordered a classic strawberry shake and a chocolate peanut butter sundae   The strawberry shake was solid  with bits of strawberry throughout  The chocolate peanut butter sundae was extremely sweet which wasnt for me but my kids happily devoured  A fun place to stop in at for dessert with the family  If you have a sweet tooth youll love the sundaes  if not stick with the shakes ,?
194458,After looking for a maid service for sometime  a friend recommended Cardinal Maids   Ive never had a maid service clean my house so I was skeptical  but I must say it was well worth  Booking the appointment online was very easy  the maids were on time  and needed very little direction from me   I was impressed with the cleaning as well  it makes me want to keep my house this spotless all the time ,?
196435,After my GPS took me in circles a few times  I finally made it to Pips  except now its Johnnys   I understand not much has changed   The other patrons were mostly regulars   The amount of butter used is heart stopping   And the breakfast was topnotch Its a tiny little place  though  so I wouldnt recommend going on a weekend unless absolutely necessary   As it was  my friend and I got the last table when we showed up around 9am on a random weekday   I cant remember what my breakfast was officially called on the menu  but it included eggs  bacon  home fries  toast and pancakes   Those who know me know my love for bacon  but here at Johnnys the pancakes were my favorite part of the meal Those pancakes were outstanding  and probably enough to get me to return eventually at which time I will sit at the counter and enjoy watching my breakfast being made   I think a good show will only add to my rating in the future ,?
197181,After my issue with the car wash  the owner responded with a satisfactory resolution   That was appreciated ,?
198233,After only being open for less than six months  this location in South Fayette has permanently closed It was announced last week that Noodles and Company planned to close 55 of its 510 stores nationwide   Also closed are the locations in Monroeville  Peters Township  Washington  and Wexford ,?
198355,After ordering the wait for the food was unbearable   The burgers were not good  Mine was missing avocado   The bottom of the bun was over cooked  The meat was dry   If we had brought wine maybe we wouldnt have been so aware of the entire situation  Unfortunately we got one of the last tables after we arrived   Sad as the waitress was very nice and apologetic ,?
198410,After our UYE hike at Red Rock Canyon  we came here to have some lunch   I opted to skip breakfast foods and go with a Reuben sandwich with french fries   The sandwich was good but it needed some more Thousand Island dressing a good Reuben has I am upping my rating to  four stars because of the excellent service we got when our previous server went on break  quit  or whatever  and we got Elias   He got me a cinnamon roll to go and made sure it was packed well in a styrofoam container and then put in a paper bag   He was also OK with our group of ten getting singleton and doubleton checks   It just didnt bother him and was part of his job Now  the Golden Gate needs to validate parking tickets whether you have a slot card or not!  You earn enough from DuPars   Thats a deal breaker for me with much of downtown ,?
198495,After our favorite Thai restaurant in Chandler closed down  we were forced to drive quite a long way to get to another favorite  Now  with Charm Thai in downtown Chandler  we have another favorite close to home We stopped by on a Saturday afternoon  so it was pretty quiet there with only a couple of other tables being served We had the green curry with tofu and veggies and the Thai fried rice with chicken  Both dishes were excellent! Portion sizes were generous as well  so we had enough for a light dinner later The service was excellent as well  so it made the whole experience superb!,?
198744,After our vet of ten plus years retired  we are thankful to have found Four Peaks! They were very efficient  showed great care for our Chocolate Labrador  and their prices are fair which can be difficult to find in North Scottsdale  As our pets enter their golden years  so comforting to have a vet who is so caring and trustworthy ,?
199350,After posting this review  I sent a copy to the owner at Organic Dry Cleaners by email   He never responded   This place does bad work and provides bad customer service   Dont go there ,?
200937,After reading flawless reviews on this place  I decided to go and give it a try today  All I can say is Dr  Angela is really nice and you can see she is very knowledgeable in her career  Both Brian and her helped me look for frames and took the time to show me options  he then went over prices and wasnt pushy about options that other big name places would suggest you get   He thoroughly explained the pros and cons of each lense option and leaves it to you to choose  I really enjoyed this office and would suggest anyone else not sure of where to go to go here first   Im new in town and while there are a few others with high reviews as well I dont regret one second of my time here ,?
202428,After reading the excellent reviews on yelp  I decided to give this place a try  And Im so glad I did!! I called at 12:30 on a Friday  and was able to be seen at 1:30 that same day  The salon itself was very well kept and designed  And every staff member was very friendly  I had the stylist Colleen  To put it simply  shes awesome!! I hadnt had my hair cut in a really long time and she worked with me  listening to me and adding her input when I asked for it  The results: my hair looks amazing! She taught me how to do the style myself while she was blowdrying it and then again afterwards  The cut and style cost only $50 too  you cant beat that! (Ive paid way more for top salon cuts that looked much worse)  Shes very nice and funny and the conversation flowed the whole time  I will recommend her and this salon to anyone  Ill definitely be back ,?
202706,After reading the other two reviews I was saddened by their experience  However  we had an excellent experience with the Evan J  Strong funeral Service  The funeral director came to my aunts home to make the arrangements personally and everything went smoothly  The personal and professional care was outstanding  I have unfortunately lost both parents and as executor found the process monumental and it consumed my time before the funeral  Evan Strongs service did all the arrangements for the funeral mass and the internment  My aunt was able to spend time with family and grieve which is what she needed to do  I highly recommend this service ,?
202720,After reading the positive Yelp reviews I decided to give this company a try  Maybe I got the one bad technician or he was having a bad day  After rearranging my afternoon to be able to meet Fred  it ended up being a waste of time since he obviously didnt want to be there and couldnt wait to leave  My daughters house is two stories  Fred doesnt climb ladders so that was the end of his visit  He said they havent been doing AC systems very long so only would do single story homes  Shouldnt the salesperson I talked to on the phone have vetted the situation before setting up the appointment? Any way we ended up finding a Howard Air a fantastic smaller company with employees who care and provide excellent service ,?
203359,After reading the reviews we were hesitant about trying this place out  But we figured we try  Boy are we all glad we did We got there at 8:30 am on Sunday and were seated immediately   Our server brought water and offered coffee while we looked over the menue  Our order was taken and about 15 minutes later our food arrived  Everyone in our group got biscuits and graveyard and we all thoroughly enjoyed them  I thought the grave was very creamy with lots of flavor but wish it had bigger chunks of sausage  The biscuits were very good  Flakey and rich  The hash browns were crispy on the outside and not to soft on the inside with lots of buttery potato flavor   The thick cut bacon was excellent  (nice that u get 3 pieces) We all said that we will be back ,?
203728,After realizing I had not supported my neighborhood restaurants in a while and being hungry for mediterranean food  I popped in to Yallas   It was after lunch and the restaurant was very quiet I was looking up at the menu on the wall  when a very nice young man pointed out the menu was also on the counter   No neck strain necessary   Plus  I can see better   So  I ordered the vegetable skewer plate for $8 50   Initially I thought it was a little pricey until I got home and opened it The food is stored in a styrofoam container with a large area in front and two smaller areas the back   The large front area was filled generously with very tasty rice   I loved the seasoning  it was delicate and smelled beautiful   Two large vegetable skewers were placed on top  filled from end to end with a variety of grilled veggies like tomato  red pepper  mushroom  red onion   The were cooked perfectly with just a hint of a bite There was definitely enough for two to share   Ill be back!,?
203851,After receiving a suggestion to come here  my mom and I did for lunch  We loved it! By far the best Brussels sprouts we ever had  And our ramen bowls were delicious! It was perfect for an extremely cold day in Charlotte  I just moved to the area and Ill definitely be back!,?
204095,After relocating to the area I needed to find a new stylist and took a chance on a Groupon for cut and color with Brian figuring anything he could do with my hair would be an improvement to my overgrown roots    Brian did an awesome job on both my color and cut   He listened to what I wanted and took the time to review the color information my previous stylist had given me   I felt comfortable from the minute I sat in the chair and Im so happy I found Brian!,?
204297,After responding by yelp regarding a bad experience I got a phone call from a District manager   She was awesome!  She thanked me for my feedback and handled the phone call with exceptional customer service  She was kind enough to tell me she would send me a gift card the following day   I will go back and give them another go around!!  ThanksI started this review appx a month ago and still have never received anything from the gal who called so maybe I was mistaken on the customer service again   Why would you go to the trouble of calling individuals who take the time to complain  boast about your customer service and then not follow through   I guess it starts at the top and trickles down ,?
204585,After scheduling a late morning appointment for 10:30  the guy finally shows up at 1:15pm and raises his voice because we would be there in 8 minutes and then proceeds to tell me they cant pump the septic via the pipe that was installed by the contractor to pump the tank and when I tried asking why he raised his voice again and then hung up on me  So I called Dan at the Health District and got a list of permitted contractors ,?
205070,After seeing Julia and Julia  I was on an excursion to try out all the things French Cuisines  and this came at the right time   The restaurant  is hidden inside Cesar in the corner with a very narrow space   The decor is mimimal considering the price on the menu   People who ate there that night was very snobbish  and acted like royality like   LOL  I came here with my bf and we are casual people  so the fun from looking and observing the crowd was hysterical   Food    its was ok  simply not the best  and the price is extremely high   by bf couldnt stop talking about the price of a wine listed on their menu for $40 000   We opted for $100 bottle which came out to be the best wine Ive had   We chated a bit with one of the waitress there and she gave us some other places to try that wouldnt break our savings  she was uber cool ,?
205633,After seeing so many 5 stars reviews we decided to give this a try  If youve read my other reviews  Leos at Arrowhead is the best Hawaiian in Phoenix (so far)  We ordered beef Kalbi short ribs  Teriyaki beef and chicken  First up the Kalbi werent short ribs but cut up beef  nothing like Korean short ribs Im used to  The teriyaki beef and chicken were just ok  RIce and macaroni salad were also not as good as Leos ,?
205651,After seeing so many good reviews of this place  including that from Bourdain  we decided to try this restaurant last weekend!  And to our dismay  it did not meet our expectations   It is tapas style here where you order a couple dishes to share   We had the duck confit dish  a raw tuna salad and some other app that I cant even remember because it was that unmemorable   Portions were small  food was not good and each dish was expensive (1220$ each!)   Service and decor was ok  but it did not make up for the below average food   Needless to say  we left with a pretty big dent in our wallets but still hungry and had to fill our tummies elsewhere   I will not be coming here again  nor would I recommend this place to anyone   Very disappointed to say the least ,?
206075,After seeing their flyer and procrastinating every day since I finally decided to try it and Im absolutely in love with this place  Their food is delicious and I love the ambience and their music  I will definitely be back ,?
206254,After seeing your commercial we decided to get dinner last night from Boston Market via the drive thru  When we got home we were highly disappointed in the portion size! Somebody was not paying attention when portioning out the food  as one of our meals was a 3piece dark meat  Someone didnt notice we only actually got two pieces of chicken  The leg meat of one piece had fallen to the side  So  we actually got two pieces and a meatless bone The food quality was still yummy however frustrating to not see this error until were unpackaging the food at home  Boston Market is NOT one of the cheaper options for dinner  so it is expected to get what youre paying for  And this case we did not ,?
206633,After several years  this is still my favorite place for green curry chicken  Thai tea with boba is excellent here  Its nice and small which helps the atmosphere  Service has always been great and they remember you when you are a returning customer  Im always happy to take people there with me and will be back again soon ,?
206990,After some Viet food on the west side decided to bring the parents for dessert to this bakery and it was a home run out the park!My dad went with sponge cake that was very soft and just delicious (albeit on the sweet side) but still perfect companion to the hot choco latte that he chose   My mother and I both loved the taro filled donut   Imagine an angel  take all that goodness add taro  split it in half  and enjoy with an Americano or macchiato like my mother and I did on a cold afternoon like we had today and you have a winning dessert combo Taro filled donut was so soft and good  I felt like I for sure am not going to make it past the pearly gates for it is no doubt such a sinfully great donut Oh and I have to give my respects to the bakers and the lady out front serving the drinks and ringing up people  very good service indeed   Great baked goods and great service   Unbeatable bakery in town!,?
207987,After stopping over at Big O Tires and my car dealership to get a nail out of my tire they all turned me down because they were either closing or it was something they could NOT fix   Pep Boys was on my way home so I had hope that they could remove the nail  which they couldnt  I would need a new tire   So they gave me hope that my tire wouldnt be completely flat by the morning  So the guy decides to ADD AIR!!!! to my tire   I start to drive and my tire makes a hissing sound  Im thinking to myself  why would he add air and what the hell did he do to my car   Well thank the car gods that my house was less than 5 minutes away  I get out of my car and my tire was completely flat    Can you imagine if I had gotten on the free way?!  My tire would have made it through the night had he not added air to my car   Never again! Ill stick to Big O Tires   Thanks ,?
209565,After tons of research and excellent reviews  I had decided to contact this salon and take a leap of faith that I would find a talented hairstylist   I was fortunate to receive an appointment with Allison who is an amazing artist who provides phenomenal customer service and an awesome head massage   I am so pleased with my beautiful cut and color that I will only go to Allison from now on   The staff at the salon are super friendly; the salon and its decor is clean and stylish   No attitude here at this salon just a sense of comfort and professionalism without being stuffy ,?
209880,After trying another high end salon and not being happy with my cut I decided to try Sean who got great reviews   He took the time to explain the cut I wanted and my type of hair  etc   I was not rushed AT ALL!!   Although he didnt cut much (we are looking to grow it longer) there was a definite difference with how my hair looked   They are a little pricey with color  but the cuts are reasonable   I would definitely recommend Sean   Ill be using him for my color also:) ,?
210457,After two visits  terrible   Cochinita Pibil tacos dry and tasteless   And with French fries!  Guacamole should be advertised as chopped (at least as well as you can with a spoon by a server who told us it was a pain to do guacamole tableside when it was busy!) avocado not guacamole   Service seemed just plain uninterested   Prices not justified at all for what you are going to experience ,?
210858,After visiting Thuy for the first time  now I know why all her customers follow her where ever she goes  even out of state! She is so amazing! I have been getting Brazilians for over 10 years and this was the most painless Brazilian I have ever received  Also  one of the best after seeing the results  She makes you feel very comfortable by engaging in fun conversation and also getting to know you and letting you get to know her ,?
211109,After visiting the aquarium  I came here with my crew  Unfortunately  it started raining  otherwise we wouldve sat in their nice outdoor patio  The food was very delicious and the presentation was outstanding  The ambience is very chic  and family friendly  Most of the customers are hotel guests and theres direct indoor access to subway from the hotel ,?
211305,After waiting 2 1/2 months to see Dr  Halmi for a sclerotherapy consult I was shocked to find that he actually does not treat spider veins with sclerotherapy   The website has extensive information on the procedure to treat spider veins   The website describes spider veins as small  visible surface veins that can appear as blue  pink  purple or red lines      And yet what I waited two months to hear by Dr  Halmi is that he does not perform schlerotherapy on blue spider veins  only red ones!  My legs have about 10% red veins and 90% small surface blue veins  He said he hasnt injected blue spider veins in 15 years   Thank you for the no charge consultation  but perhaps stop recommending that you perform the sclerotherapy procedure at all ,?
211500,After waiting close to 20 minutes and being the only car in the drivethru  fries were cold  soggy  and tasteless  Not impressed ,?
211751,After waiting several days for an appointment  which was made for the 57 pm hour (its the last one of the day so if youre a 95er be prepared to have to leave work early) I rushed home as to be on time for the service call  At 5:44  45 minutes after they were to be there  I received a call saying they were not able to find a technician to come to my home  They wanted to reschedule  I told them to forget it  thanks for wasting the last hour of my work day in addition to 45 minutes waiting around for you not to show  No second chance here  One star is too many ,?
211833,After walking about 15k in the searing heat this place was a welcome stop  Really nice patio overlooking the strip with water misters constantly going to keep you cool and you enjoy their many beers on offer  We ordered the loaded waffle fries between us and it was fantastic  Great staff and great bar means we will definitely be coming back ,?
213476,After years of service and 3 years of corporate discounts Verizon decided I was lying about my employment  So I cancelled them  They said that it didnt matter if the store verified my app or that I sent in my pay stubs  So they lose 1000 a year  Good riddance ,?
214175,Again  Dunkin? Seriously? You make this exhausted mama SO sad as I drive away with no latte ,?
215305,Agree   Best hibachi in town   Also most expensive but you pay for what you get   Atmosphere is nice employees are friendly   Sushi is best on this side of town  No just wish they would do something different as far as the hibachi cooks perform its always the same routine and gets boring hearing the same thing over and over ,?
216613,Ah  the Fox  Ive spent several enjoyable evenings here for karaoke  Its in a convenient location for me  and theres usually just the right sized crowd  Enough to make it fun  but not so packed that you have to wait forever to belt out some tunes I usually dont eat when I come here  but I have been for breakfast a few times  The food is alright and the prices are reasonable  Really nothing special though  Still a great place to pass an evening ,?
217523,Ahh  the Biosphere is full of interesting short films and interactive exhibits about sustainability  Kudos to the museum for promoting the education of this idea! We stumbled upon here thinking it was the more popular Biodome  which we didnt figure out until later  Such is the life of an ignorant American traveling in a different country! (It looks like we werent the only ones judging by a fellow Yelper  You see  anyone can make that mistake )Anyway  I highly recommend this museum if you love learning about eCOOLogique  They have a sweet rooftop exhibit as well with an amazing view  We  New Yorkers  love anything with rooftops (dont know why  we just do)  Dont forget to fill out the survey at the end of your trip and take an awesome photo with your friends ,?
217721,Ahhh Sweet ESC  Why such high reviews? Small little dessert shop  small selection of desserts  a tad on the expensive side    Dont think Id come back ,?
217799,Ahhh smash! Hard to not give this place a perfect 5 star rating! This place serves up some of the best meals I have eaten  always so fresh and delicious! First tried this place years ago  I found this gem tucked away in the corner of the adjoining plaza its located in  never have I thought twice about returning  Staff are friendly  food is BOMB  prices are very fair for what you get and the whole overall atmosphere is cozy and welcoming  The only downside to this place is its size  it is sometimes hard to get a table for more than 5  especially with it becoming so well known around the Markham/Unionville area over the years ,?
218239,Ahhhh our favorite go to when we just want islander food and sushi   we are so lucky to have this place in Vegas!!!  We discovered it years ago through friends from Hawaii and still drive all the way across town to come here regularly!! We love the island special   the mauna kea   Maui wowie   the croc is awesome   We always get the poke   garlic chicken   seaweed salad and save room for dessert  We usually come for the Sunday brunch   they have a special menu in addition to their regular ayce menu and its only $21 95!!!! I always treat myself to the tempura ice cream   its so Ono!!! Love you guys   dont ever change!!!!!,?
218681,Ahi Steak sandwich WOW! Love it  Halibut amazing  apps are great! The beer cant beat it!,?
218729,Ahi tuna sandwich and fish tacos were bomb!!! Recommend!!,?
219107,Air Jordan! need I say more?,?
219631,Ajisen ramen has more selection on their menu than most ramen places  I particularly like their seaweed salad  It tastes fresh and does not smell ( some seaweed salads have this subtle smell which does not appeal to me)   The ramen is decent but not particularly exceptional  I used to like it before I tried Kenzo ramen  I find Kenzos broth richer and more complex in flavour  Ajisens noodles I find better than Kenzos  Overall  Ajisen is not bad and I would return if I didnt have to drive so far ,?
219701,Akai is another attempt to bring Harbord street to life and have a nice  way more quieter alternative to the Annex madness It just partially achieves so though  Of course  if you are thinking to go to trashy Bloor street sushi bars  please go here instead  Its still a nice alternative just one block south  The place is small and cozy and the service is always superpolite Dont expect to be enlightened by the taste  The salmon/tuna are regularly fresh  some very interesting rolls are offered (my favorite is the crunch  could eat 5 of those!) and every possible modification of the menu is accepted  On the subjective side I find the rolls too small so I always have to spend more $$ to get full  I still keep coming back there from time to time when a good old sushi craving hits me ,?
220233,Alamo is a good option for car rental in Las Vegas   Recommended  I had a very bad experience with Dollar at McCarran last year  See the reviews here and avoid Dollar  they suck  Alamo was great  Easy fast check in with ATM like machines  The car was in good shape but I did find a half eaten slim Jim in the back seat  Yuck  All said it was a good experience and will be my goto car rental next time Im in Vegas ,?
220353,Alan left Totii G Salon  Alan is at Las Vegas Beauty Supply and Wholesale  Please call Alan at 7325818665,?
220622,Albert Youhanan is a THIEF and a LIAR and a CRIMINAL  Over a year ago I gave him a $4000 deposit and then he returned my deposit with cheques that all bounced and stupidly he conned me again and did not show up at the dealership to give the $4000 deposit   DO NOT DEAL with this person ,?
221309,Alex and his team are amazing  We called this morning to inquire further about the Groupon special  Alex not only said we could take our car in right then  but also offered an amazing price for darker tint without a Groupon  Tint looks so great  that well be back next weekend to do my car too! Thanks again 305 Kustoms  I will be telling everyone about your place!,?
222033,Alexis has done my hair for 2 years  I always do something fun at the end of the school year  This is her amazing work!,?
222473,Alicia is the bestest ever great at fixing hair color   Great place to visit and great prices,?
222852,All American is the only estate sale company I have been frequenting for more than 10 years  Always great finds!! The proprietor Bobbi is a very fair business woman  Dont let her shrewd business like manner scare you off she has a big heart  She takes very good care of her customers and her clients  When I receive Bobbis emails I get excited and cant wait for Friday! Stop by and tell her a very happy long time returning customer sent you  I promise you  you will always find a treasure at a very fair and reasonable price!! Enjoy hunting!!,?
223040,All I can is MEH   For the price point  I thinking the food to die for   But I cant express how average it was for me   First  the place was deserted  like two other parties in the whole joint  Huh    interesting  We went to Mortons to celebrate a friends birthday  They did it right with personalized menus and confetti on the table   Hands down it was awesome  The gesture is pretty awesome since most places dont come close to that   I ordered a salad and the filet mignon tacos  I was that hungry   The salad was cool   The tacos you get more of everything else but filet  and should be called tacos of condiments hahahaha  The filet looked like beef jerk or barbacoa   For me the best was the berries and cream   Absolutely amazing!  Just overall not impressed with the price and selection   Maybe I partial to my favorites ,?
224090,All I can say is go to the happy hour    great great prices   you gotta get the hot rocks   food is good   ask for the free bread    killer!!!!,?
224205,All I can say is some of the best huevos rancheros and chiliqueles Ive ever had  This place was serving breakfast and although it was quiet on a Labor Day morning  the food was fantastic Most dishes came with meat  but the cooks can alter it as you like  Our server was so friendly and smiley  Food arrived quickly and was just so damn good  Im sure dinner menu is just as tasty  but for a delicious Mexican style breakfast  this is my new favorite ,?
224388,All I can say is that we were starving and needed some heavy food to prepare us for a night on the town  Their food is pretty bad and Im for certain that my burrito was cooked in a microwave and then smothered with red sauce  The beans they use are definitely canned and probably the cheapest you can buy  I dont know what kind of  beans they were but they were a weird brownish gray color and I picked them out of my burrito  Most Mexican places use refried beans  This place they were whole and undercooked  Yikes! We were lucky that we didnt get food poisoning ,?
224468,All I can say is this experience is a must while in Las Vegas  It is totally worth the price and it is super hush hush about the menu; but if you keep an open mind it is a great date night experince ,?
225606,All I have to say is that I will drive an hour to get my supplies from this place  including custom canvas frames and quality paint  The staff is very friendly and have gone out of their way to fill my orders  If you need professional quality supplies  Kensington should be your destination ,?
226121,All I wanted was a brownie and ice cream  I didnt want froyo   I didnt want takeout Once I saw the Hot Stone desserts here I was sold  but the reviews! I took my chances and was very pleased!I got the chocolate lava one  I tried my bfs chocolate chip one and didnt care for it much  was SO happy w mine   Glad we beat the crowd because the line moved slow behind us  They didnt seem to have many flavors  but I guess maybe thats their thing  with the mixing and everything ,?
227628,All i can say about this club aside from the other reviews  is that I loved the view   They have a balcony that overlooks the strip  Crazyness ensued  as well as my drunkness   Which led me to a calorie laden double qtr pounder combo from Mcds afterward  LOLOverall music  mostly house  and a lil hip hop   Kinda dark  so really couldnt check out anyone  which could be a good thing :)Drinks  yes steep on price    We got in for free  so F* it    ,?
227675,All i can say is that Dr  Coffey is a very smart and skilled chiropractor   He took his education to the highest level and he really knows how to assess the problem   He treats you like a patient not just like another customer walking in the door   He will also educate you   He is extremely well priced   His office is right across the street from EOS fitness which is convenient because thats my gym   Dr  Coffey will be seeing me bi week for adjustments!,?
227810,All in all a decent star alliance club  Not quite up to par for a hub location as compared to the NW/DL DTW clubs or the UA  SFO  locations  its still pleasant and quiet  (BTW this is a club in the B terminal )As a European Star Alliance Gold member I can get access even when flying US domestic  In the US when flying domestic First you do not get access to lounges  You have to buy memberships or day passes ,?
229292,All of wizardry  theatrics and tinctures you could possibly want in a cool urban residential neighborhood comfortably distant from touristy downtown area  It is stumbling distance from Au Pied de Cochon and the walk helped us work off a fraction of the calories   The bartenders are skilled but the guy practicing bar tricks and constantly dropping the bottle was distracting    Just practice at home until you are ready for the big show ,?
230110,All the employees are 1619 years old with zero backbone  Theyre to shy or scared to enforce safety rules  No employee watches over the areas to prevent aggressiveness  The place is hard to have younger kids there Bc of some older kids/teens know they can bully the littlest and the staff doesnt care  All the trampolines and foam pits are really cool  But they really need a employee to be like a life guard at a pool and enforce safety rules ,?
231046,All the rolls Ive tried and appetizers have been VERY salty  I wouldnt recommend them  But their sashimi is a whole other story! They give VERY GENEROUS portions for the sashimi which is great! For once the fish is longer than the lump of rice! Especially since it is so close to school  I would come back just for those big chunks of sashimi! And to see if they have green tea tempura ice cream   ,?
231358,All the times I have gone  the quality of the burgers were always good  They were big and juicy and have so many assortments of burgers that you come back to try them all  But for 15 dollars plus for just the burger and side is way too expensive  I would rather go to hero burger where I can get a drink  and a side for a cheaper price ,?
232142,All was received as promised exactly on time  Placed a second order today!! I live in Apache Junction AZ and its snowbird season  so every elderly person in the country is roaming the isles of my local grocery store Getting my groceries delivered saves me a TON of time gas and spares my rapidly dwindling sanity :) Hopefully my second  order goes as flawless as the first!!,?
232876,All you have to do is read the comments after the reviews to know what kind of guy is running this cold  noisy  falling down joint   We will never be back ,?
234240,Almost a 4 star family restaraunt  Mixed feelings on the staff  some are great some arent  Lots of wine on the menu from Italy but the wine list lacks any description other than varietal and brand  Menu hits the normal american version of italian food but with tradition and great sauce  Its a great place to take mom and dad and the kids ,?
234420,Almost as good as Fazolis  only without free breadsticks and 5x the price  QUITE disappointing ,?
234719,Almost fell asleep while getting work done  very good and comfortable experience  Will be returning in 2 weeks for more work,?
234767,Almost got killed trusting all the reviews and folks in neighborhood garage  I went to neighborhood garage for a noise from my steering  A shop in uptown told me correctly the problem and Andrew told me completely wrong  Somehow  I trusted him and replaced the item that he suggested me  The noise was still there and I went here again twice/trice  He told me nothing is wrong and lied to me that he inspected the control arm and it is fine  Finally  my control arm broke one day  Thankfully it happened while I am trying to park my car  If it had happened while driving in i77 or i80  I would have got killed  All because I trusted this guys judgement  I would never ever take my car again to a small shop like again  To my knowledge  he is not a cheater but I guess he is lacking skill  A very friendly guy but that wouldnt have stopped me from getting killed ,?
235359,Along the newer part of the extended main street of Bradford is Cancun Mexican Grill  a standout among McD  Timmys  Swiss Chicken and other Canadian institutional food outlets   Its small  and simple  less colorful than La MexiCanada  but good  simple food none the less   Im sure that being family owned has something to do with it The portions are slightly larger than La MexiCanada  but smaller than Made in Mexico   If you are looking for something other than the big chains  this is the place ,?
236208,Alright place  Expensive for the portion  and the taste is not anything special  though not bad  Their 10% off if you pay with cash is very nice  (paying you back for evading taxes) Space is small  cramped seating  Miso soup is alright and not too salty  There are probably better places around though ,?
236392,Alright so we were downtown Fremont enjoying a fun date night out and happened to smell the burgers a sizzling over at Binions cafe  We were hungry and  remembered the yummy burger we had last time  Our service and experience from the previous visit was horrendous and we decided to give the Cafe another shot! We decided to stroll through and check out the wait and to our surprise there was no line and plenty of open seats We grabbed a seat at the bar and were greeted by the main cook who is Awesome! He took really good care of us all of the way through  kept our drinks filled and even chatted with us for a bit The burgers were delicious and our tab was low so you cant beat that with a stick!I am pleased to announce our visit was much better this time around so we will be back for burgers!,?
238112,Although Hot N Juicy is better imo  the boiling crab is visit worthy  Sometimes Hot N Juicy gets crowded ( not like Boiling crab doesnt or anything)   or sometimes you might want an alternative to the asian/creole style shrimp/crawfish  and the boiling crab is the perfect alternative to hot n juicy  Id recommend this place to anybody  The only bad thing i have to say about this place  other than the obvious messy eat  and hand smell hours/days after consumption  is that this place gets very large groups    and it always seems like these large groups are always late to show up  and sit there doing nothing after they eat  taking up valuable seats to hungry waiting customers  Staff is nice from my experiences  and prices are reasonable ,?
238605,Although I gave it a bad review before  I went back a few more times and have changed my mind Its a good  local takeout chinese food restaurant ,?
239731,Although SLIGHTLY better than the deer valley and 83 ave location they are still well known for doing shoddy work and overcharging  Buyer beware your dollars are being wasted here  You can get a lot more for your money at an independent garage  I caught them trying to scam me on an oil and filter change by putting my old oil filter and air filter back in my car and I will never trust these noobs to touch my cars again  Plus their techs use air ratchets to put wheels on  (Guarantees warped rotors) and I watched the guy install mine in a circle pattern (huge no no  day one stuff ),?
240145,Although it has a generic name  dont let that fool you  Greek Wraps has the best fallafel in the city  Its not dry or overcooked  Its seasoned perfectly  The shwarma is also the best in the city  The kebab is tough and overcooked  Their humus is good but not very authentic tasting  This is better than Spices in Chandler and Phoenicia in Gilbert  Their gyros are good but many places make great gyros  Go here for the falafel and ask for the chile sauce,?
240315,Although it was better than what I expected  it wasnt anything Im going to go out of my way for  The margaritas were decent and the food was overall pretty good  however  the fried ice cream was a little disappointing for my first try  Overall you can definitely find better mexican cuisine in the valley ,?
240415,Although its not on the nicest side of town  the eclectic and iconic Neon Museum is not to be missed  This was my third time to Las Vegas and after not being able to squeeze the Neon Museum in during my first two visits  the third time was a charm! It was a short 15 minute walk there from the Fremont Street area so Id recommend squeezing this in while in the Old Vegas area  We reserved a night tour so we would be able to see those neon signs lights beautifully and brightly! Our tour guide was a lot of fun  quirky  helpful in answering any questions and overall  just made the experience so much more informative and fun  I definitely recommend the Neon Museum to any of those who are wanting to see a different side of Las Vegas and learn about its history  It was so fun walking around the neon boneyard  learning about the history of all the signs and even cool facts about neon  itself  and how its made!,?
240495,Although limited to a small late night menu the experience was decent  The actual menu you receive when you get there differs from the one posted online  which sucked   The service was great  I wanted a combination of the kool aid & an alcoholic drink  which the waiter accommodated without hesitation  The fried green tomatoes and catfish fritters were good  nice light batter & fried to perfection  The buttermilk fried yardbird with red velvet waffles & grits was good as well  however the waffles were tasteless  The grits although being tasteful were a tad salty but nothing overbearing ,?
241432,Although the food tasted good  the portion size is a disgrace  For $13 of Dan Dan Mian  you will barely have few bites  I dont think it is worth the money for hungry tourists ,?
241517,Although the food wasnt too bad  The service was the worst I have ever experienced   Waiting an hour past the promised time for pick up and even then got the order wrong   When a call was placed to complain the owner argued with me that she was right and was quite rude   Very disappointed,?
241788,Although the place looks nice and up to date   the service has been horrible these last two years  Every time I go though the drive through  they ask you to park and they will bring it out  theyll ask everyone in drive through to do this and then the parking lot is a hot mess  I dont understand it   makes no sense  A few times I waited 15 mins for them to come outside ,?
241864,Although the quality of the food in my experience has always been good at this location  the customer service including the manager has dropped to terrible lows recently   I was one of the first customers to embrace this new location and ordered from them fairly regularly having them deliver to my home almost weekly and tipped the drivers well   I loved the fact at I could pick up the phone and order if I was busy and they would be at my house in record time   I called them recently for delivery and they told me that corporate no longer would let them deliver more than a mile from the store   My location is 1 1 miles   I explained to the manager that they had already delivered to me at least 20 times prior with no problem and the manager told me sorry you need to drive here and pick up now   Not only will I not drive to pick up at this location I will no longer give Jimmy Johns any of my business ever again!  Plenty of sub shops around that will treat loyal customers better    ,?
242593,Although theyve been operating at the farmers market for some time  this is a new business to the downtown core   As a residence of the area  my wife and I make frequent walks downtown and enjoy seeing new and trendy businesses opening their doors   For the few times weve been there already  the owners and staff have been friendly and helpful   The coffee is better than the other 2 coffee shops around the corner and the cinnamon buns are delicious   I would definitely recommend the Queen Gypsy to others as this is my new downtown cafe of choice ,?
243150,Although we couldnt do the chocolate tour I was very happy with the tent they had outside  Its more like a tent that you see in those zombie outbreak movies  They did have very cold AC running with is a plus because Nevada right now feels hotter than the gates of damnation  Anyways they fretted up with chocolate  Very SEEs Candy like (which I cant complain) and browsed the tent  Very good chocolate  Will come again!,?
243805,Always I enjoy caming here with my friends  its a great place to relax and to spend your time ,?
244082,Always a delicious time at The Keg! However  this location doesnt have an espresso machine! :(I purposely chose to go to The Keg for their amazing Billy Miner Ice Cream cake pie and a latte  But no espresso machine  means no lattes at this location  Their steak  twicebaked baked potato  caesar salad  red sangria and Billy Miner Pie are delicious!!!Their calamari which I tried isnt the greatest  It was too soft  and maybe its the oil they use    just wasnt as appetizing as other calamari served at other restaurants ,?
244243,Always a fan when I find  a place where they are from Chicago  The gyro was great  and the cheese fries made it even better ,?
244399,Always a favorite! The macarons are probably the best Ive had (and ive tried a lot of them in the US  from NYC  to LA  to DC  to Baltimore)  It was the right amount of chewiness  and crunch in the shell  The flavors are amazing  but not too overly saccharine  The pistachio and the salted caramel are my favorites  I also got a chocolate croissant   OMG  it was AMAZING! The croissant was super buttery and flaky  It also had dark chocolate as the filling so it wasnt overly sweet  It was basically perfection!,?
244943,Always a good meal no matter what you get! This time I got the Pad Thai  even though Sushi was calling my name! Just had to try it  And it didnt disappoint  though its not the best in town by a longshot  Still a decent dish with plenty of chicken and the sweet/heat noodles known as Pad Thai  Note: This dish could have used more heat     just saying Overall a good meal for a really good price!,?
245508,Always a great cut and beard taming    cold beer in the fridge   straight razor shaves  a real mans barber shop ,?
245681,Always a great experience here  Their brisket is the best in Toronto especially if you like them fatty ,?
247428,Always a positive experience with Dr Trigg and the Target team    A great selection of appointment dates/times  good prices  and I leave feeling like I have been well taken care of ,?
247496,Always a sale going on Seasons are changing and after putting on a few pounds trying out new restaurants  time to get some new clothes and my wife insisted on a wind breaker after all of that rain last weekend With their Kohl;s cash and scratch off discounts plus reasonable pricing on name brands  you can get some good deals  Last week we got a great deal on a Columbia Water Proof Wind Breaker and some of their house brand long sleeve shirts  Today it was a long sleeved Nike Shirt  and all were at least 25% off Nice store with good selections  Only complaint is they dont have that many registers open at one time so there is often a backlog when you check out ,?
247909,Always accommodating  clean and professional  Nail art a plus bring pictures  they will make happen ,?
247943,Always always delicious! I usually get the medium whole shabang shrimp and a corn in the sauce  Yum! Try the fries if you want something to keep your mouth cool ;),?
248387,Always an excellent meal here  My favorite is the bone in fillet  They have a really nice bar menu also  The burgers are very good! I tried the chicken sandwich with hot sauce and blue cheese slaw last week and it was excellent  Service is always very good also,?
249212,Always clean   helpful staff who lend great opinions and options on a variety of products  Brands are limited to a few select ones and although they seem to be the higher quality or caliber than most they arent always the preferred favorites of some   Pricing is sometimes steep also but again this isnt food city its in a class all to its own   I highly recommend trying the cappuccino muffin it is nothing short of amazing ,?
249568,Always consist excellent service  New items are amazing!,?
250074,Always delicious!!! Its always a treat coming here  Friendly chefs & staff  Treated like royalties every time  Every dish was made with love  Outstanding!!!,?
251045,Always exceptional  Sitting at the bar for dinner is the way to go  The salmon appetizer is delicious  the prime rib dip is the best that Ive ever had and the rotisserie chicken is worth trying  The staff are attentive and the food is consistently good  Nice atmosphere and you never have to wait long for food ,?
251072,Always exciting to see a new local breakfast/lunch spot in the area  Atmosphere is hip and fun  Wood and metal tables and a semi open kitchen  It feels spacious and not like youre sitting on top of anyone   which is important  The menu is creative  with a mix of sweet and savory options  I tried the biscuits and gravy which were very tasty and a generous portion  The only thing that would have made it better was if the sausage was more crumbled instead of in a patty  because it was very dense  My sister had the breakfast burrito which was massive and had tons of flavor  But it is rare for me to meet a burrito I dont like  Im intrigued by the Tiramisu pancakes on the menu and plan to try them next  Service was very friendly and seemed to run smoothly for only being open a week  My breakfast w/ side of eggs and coffee left me stuffed for $11  Not bad at all  Ill definitely be back ,?
251441,Always find something useful  but keep in mind it is a discount fabric store   Customer service is quirky (youll know what I mean)  but always knowledgable!,?
253001,Always good food and service  I miss the old one out near Henderson that had a full bar and poker machines  but the food quality has always been consistent  I usually get an omelette from the menu and jazz it up a bit with some add ons,?
253207,Always good for delivery  Usually pretty quick  Chicken fried rice  orange chicken  beef lo mein and gyoza have always been good ,?
253617,Always good always on point their fried veggies are delicious  just like their burrata with jam love their beer selection ,?
253655,Always good  Always on time or early  Food is always hot  Its almost like the delivery guy is cooking it while hes driving  lol  I dont know how they do it  Best Chinese take out in Las Vegas  for sure  Potstickers are just like they should be  Chow Fun is always good & I love the hot & sour soup  You really cant go wrong ,?
254418,Always great food  Light crispy batter on the fish  Plenty of tarter sauce and malt vinegar on the side ,?
256055,Always have fresh fish (the nigiri pieces are huge) Unique flavors (unlike most sushi places where they have 2 signature flavors and it all ends up tasting the same) orange hinted rolls  bbq  coconut  lemon  All mixed with fresh fish  crab  crunch   etc  We have eaten here over a year on and off and have never had bad fish or service ,?
256140,Always have great service here  So far the best Petco out of anywhere in the Valley!,?
256456,Always helpful at this location  Went in for a nail in the tire  Got the tire fixed  all tires rotated and was out of there in less then 20 mins  Good job guys,?
256963,Always look forward to getting take out here  The staff is friendly  and the Tom Ka soup is to die for! Delicious!,?
257551,Always love the buffet  plenty of food and always bringing out fresh food  Wed  night is Prime Rib night and Fri is king crab night  Service was a bit slow getting to us our drinks  The gelato may be the best in town  Huge raw oysters too when I was there on a Wed  night is always a plus!,?
258600,Always order there love boat   comparing to before  their food quality is goes down  the sashimi is not fresh as before   Today is the worse   Salmon is outdated and its smell bad   Owner just exchange me two salmon after I told her    ????,?
258731,Always packed and super expensive  If you dont like video games like myself  dont waste your time  Everyone thinks the games are free but youre paying for them with your drink prices,?
259075,Always punctual and courteous  Ive never waited more than 15min past my appointment time  and they do my bloodwork on the spot  Nice seating area with TV   WiFi and magazines  Dr  Zoeteman is really nice  and listens to me  He does his best to make sure I stay well AMD on the right track ,?
259309,Always reliable for good pizza and reasonable prices  The ahwatukee location is the coziest Just make sure you check you credit card statement  my waitress decided to up her tip by $30 ,?
259444,Always saw the spot but never stopped by  I figured flower shops are over priced  Thankfully I stopped by one day and ordered a half a dozen roses  The lady was really nice and sweet  Gave perfect care instructions on the roses  They lasted as long as she said they would  Stopped by today again to buy some sunflowers and the sunflowers are absolutely gorgeous  They way the arrange the flower is great  My girl loves them!,?
260411,Always the coolest place to grab a craft beer on tap  a mouthwatering specialty pizza  and hang out with good friends and incredible service!!,?
260452,Always the nicest staff  Never ordered a bad cup of coffee from here  This served as a great place to work out of when I didnt have an office  Its also the perfect meeting place for friends  I mean  who doesnt love good coffee?Also  you need the alien burrito,?
260495,Always the way to begin your trip to Vegas   190 octane or a hurricane   both are delicious  but I havent tried them together   that will be my next mission   Always get the extra shot   so worth it   Jello shots are fun  too   If it is kind of slow  they will make you take it with no hands and whipped cream   So  yay for fun bartenders   Summer is on its way  kids   so enjoy yourself some blended goodness ,?
260572,Always top notch service! Joey has always designed such what Ive imagined! And the quality of the jewelry is the best  Im rough on my jewelry and nothing ever breaks!,?
260744,Always very clean  extrememly friendly staff and great food!!!! Id u havent been to ycs  its a must!! Staff is always willing to help u make youre own sauce or show u how to make their fav sauces for your bowl  And free ice cream!!! Cmon :),?
260915,Always wanted to check out Weezies  its always been a big mystery to me  No website    blinds usually down   So I finally checked it out the other day and I wasnt really impressed  The service was great  Our waitress was fun and attentive and always available to answer all the silly questions we had about the menu  The menu  kinda weird  Its basically tapas but not clearly defined  Theyve got bigger tapas items and smaller ones so we werent entirely sure how much we should order (queue the helpful waitress yet again)  The food was tasty but not that impressive  I dont even remember what we had (which I guess isnt a good thing)  I remember having asparagus with an egg on top that was overlooked :(Glad I went but I dont really have a burning desire to go back ,?
260996,Always wanted to try a Food Network chefs restaurant  so this was our chance  My husband  me and our 3 yr old daughter had a great experience there  The food was delicious  My husband had the Crunchburger  he ate up his burger in 5 minutes! I had the L A  Bunless Burger  The burger without the bun in a mix of greens  We shared the fries and sweet potato fries  Best sweet potato fries I have had in awhile  It came with honey mustard and chipotle cream sauce  The decor is causal  loved the design of the eating bar  Definitely will go back!,?
261198,Always wondered what this place was about and came across a Groupon for weekend brunch  so I finally decided to check it out  I called around 1:30 on a Sunday afternoon to see what time brunch ended and was told that they werent accepting anymore walkins or reservations for the day even though brunch ended at 3    boo  Tried again a little earlier on the next Saturday and successfully set a reservation for 2pm  Got there a few minutes after  and to my surprise  the place was nearly empty considering the full list the weekend before  Our server was nice & cheerful  I ordered the bacon croissant sliders & my hunny ordered the green & white omelet  both of which came with breakfast potatoes  The food took a pretty long while to come out for the place to be so unbusy  but it was all delicious  Music selection was a cool eclectic mix   maybe a good Pandora channel? Allinall great brunch in a modern chill spot without all the hustle & bustle  May try the patio next time ,?
261281,Always your best bet when it comes to small kid entertainment   This CEC was pleasantly clean and had all the games in working order   I also think they must have changed the pizza because its not as greasy as I remember it  which is a good thing   I ordered the family 2 pizza deal and it fed my three boys well   I went to purchase a salad from the salad bar and the nice guy at the counter let me have it for free   If you think about it  youd end up shelling out way more money taking the kids to an amusement park or the fair   Its a nice celebratory place where everyone can have fun ,?
261366,Always  A good  Experience  Always  Sincerely nice     And helpful  And always willingness to help people ,?
262190,Amaaaaaazing! Audrey made me feel super comfortable and I am so in love with my new brows! She makes sure that youre totally in love with the shape and double checks in between to make sure you absolutely are okay  The pain is nothing  You can hear a slight scratching noise thats a bit freaky but its not painful at all and shell check in to make sure the numbing cream is working  If youve been going back and forth about it JUST DO IT!,?

264834,Amazing Pho!!!

265251,Amazing Taco Tuesday! $1 50 tacos and they had calamity steak as a special this week that sold out before I got there (8pm) but Id love to try it  The habanero sauce is super spicy  which I love  and the carne asada taco was amazing! Guacamole was also pretty fresh and its BYOB with a liquor store next door!,?
265959,Amazing and Fresh!!!  My favorite place now  Small dining area  Great staff  Great service  The Spicy Beef noodle was Perfecto!!!  Their Signature Beef noodle dish was Very Very Good too  Steamed Chicken dumplings were Yummy!

267906,Amazing brunch place!  I found the Brunch Club as I was running by   So glad I stopped in (twice!)  Their wake up call drinks are delicious   I would suggest the Wake Up Beer  a mix of a local porter and a shot of espresso   For the nonbeer drinkers  the frozen screwdriver and bellini were equally delicious   I was also very impressed with the food options  very eclectic and friendly for all palates   The Lox Box is picture perfect and my favorite   I also enjoyed the Farmers Hash  the sweet potatoes are fantastic   Dont forget to get a homemade donut on your way out  the blueberry cheesecake donut was a winner Will definitely come by again when Im visiting Madison ,?
268764,Amazing chicken! Came here for my staycation  I usually eat at Canes but this chicken blows it out of the water! I was greeted by Hugo and he was really nice and friendly  Came back to compliment them on their chicken and thasked if I would write a review by Karina and Angelina and Its the least I could do for them  They were really busy when I came to order and they managed to get my order out pretty quickly  Would totally recommend this place ,?
271951,Amazing experience! Food portions huge and perfectly seasoned  Dont expect to find salt and pepper on your table you wont need it!

272603,Amazing favors  I got the brisket and my husband got the chicken skewers  We were blown away by the favors  Im used to kind of bland  super fatty TexMex  so I was definitely in for a surprise  We ordered the Gouda tamales on the side  and they did not disappoint! We had the goat cheese guac which was also good  I wish Id tried other guacs though ,?
272693,Amazing fine dining experience  Since this was my first time here we both opted for the five course tasting menu  Each dish was delicious and refine and the foie gras particularly was divine  One of the best places to try for any special occasion ,?

272924,Amazing foodGreat ServiceLunch and dinner services which are both awesomeWonderful Price PointPlus a great old world wine list :),?
273031,Amazing food & service! Must have is the aged prime rib  Its 20 something ounces with the bone We also ordered the medium stone crabs (came in 7 pieces to the order $40)  As for sides  the Brussels sprouts were soooo good! they came out looking burnt but had so much flavor! The Jenny mashed potatoes didnt have anything special about it ,?

283532,Amazing pizza and amazing service! I went here with a large group and the staff was very accommodating  I ordered the Emilia and it was AMAZING! The meat  cheese  and thin crust worked perfectly together  You can eat one pizza for yourself but if you want you can share with others! I love coming here because of the great pizza!,?

285653,Amazing place   My friend was raving about Burger Priest for sometime  so tonight she finally brought me there and it was love at first bite!  I ordered the Priest  which consists of 1 beef patty plus a cheese filled  garlic seasoned battered and fried portobello mushroom with all the fixings (lettuce  tomato  onion  mayo  ketchup and pickles)   It was incredible   So juicy  so beefy and so gooey!  They must make their patties in house as they look and taste so good  They lose a star because their fries were not memorable   I hope they change their fries or serve onion rings   :),?
286064,Amazing pork stew   tasted like roast duck lolCrab fried rice was not fishy at all  very yummy Calamari was good so was the chicken satay The chicken pad seewu wasnt too greasy!Definitely would return,?
287152,Amazing sandwiches for a great cause  Eclectic but enjoyable atmosphere  This is a casual dining experience  so dont go expecting something other than that ,?
287429,Amazing selection of board games  tabletop RPG  and puzzles  The staff is super knowledgeable and will recommend games to you based on ones you already like  They are always willing to help and will demo (or at least explain) any game they have on the shelf Prices are 1015% higher than Amazon  but with that comes hightouch customer service and the knowledge that youre helping a locallyowned brickandmortar shop ,?
287949,Amazing service and even better food! Great atmosphere! Definitely a new favorite for date night!,?

291111,Amazing staff and awesome views  We went here before our dinner reservations at Rivea  The bartender was very friendly and helpful  We sat at the bar but the views from the smaller tables along the windows are definitely prime real estate  Id love to go back once the weather is cooler and sit out on the balcony  Gorgeous  fun place!,?
291114,Amazing staff and beautifully kept grounds!!! Emily has been amazing to work with and any issues we have had are always handled immediately   They even offer spraying for pest control  which was an amazing added bonus   Definitely recommend this place!!,?
291268,Amazing staff that was very comforting during my wax! They made sure I was comfortable and gave me advice on how to take care for my skin at home  including how tos and products  I will never go to another waxing establishment again  Love Layne and everything about Sugar Me,?
291947,Amazing sushi and happy hour  favorite rolls are the baked scallop and the Philadelphia roll! Atmosphere awesome and staff is too legit to quit!,?
292281,Amazing sweets! Had the brownie cheesecake with vanilla ice cream and whipped cream    Amazing! Very upbeat environment with great staff! Definitely worth the stop when youre in Greektown!,?

292624,Amazing team!   Great hair by Demi and Anthony    I would Highly recommend for great color and cut   ,?
293014,Amazing udon!!! Between the atmosphere and authentic food it was a truly unique experience in Vegas  First amazing ramen then great Korean BBQ now make way for udon Vegas :) and dont worry they have pork cutlet and much more for those they are noodle shy :),?
293025,Amazing updos / wedding hair  The hairdresser for my sisters wedding cancelled a few weeks prior and Capisto was able to get us in lastminute! I LOVED my updo and the airbrush makeup was unbelievable  Although pricey  I totally recommend it ,?
293410,Amazing view  friendly service and delicious food  Still have a photobook to remind of that day ,?
293698,Amazing wings! Best ever on my top 5 list of wings!  They arent soggy  but crisp and the sauce and/or spice sticks to them   They arent overly cooked  The hottest sauce/rub is truly hot!  I loved it!  The fries are delicious   It takes time to get order because its cooked fresh!  So worth the wait!,?
294131,Amazing!   The girls in the front are always   so so nice  Food was  (last week) as always   so delicious   What I love about Notable is consistency  some restaurants you can get great food  one week and the next day or week  not so much  Ive been to Notable over 30 (min)  times and I almost always order the chicken  everyone else experiments   Amazing!!!!   Not one of our friends or our group leaves with with (was an off night)    I have never found a great place for chicken in Calgary  until I ordered it by mistake at Notable   Best mistake ever!   :)     Youll always leave happy that you got a great meal   The waitresses are also wonderful and no Im not related to the owner :) promise    Kudos to him and the chef!! Please excuse this less than perfect review though you get the basic ( its great) as  its about 3am ,?
294369,Amazing!  Ordered the Omakase  was so fresh that I could taste the Ocean  This place is legit ,?
294516,Amazing!  You create a pizza like you would create your sub at subway   However  unlike subway where your stuck with the meats on that sub and each sub has its own price  here you choose what ever you want and it is one price   The toppings are awesome and plentiful  dont be shy  ask for what ever you want   The pie is large (11 inches) so it is easily shared or you will have leftovers   The quality is there  the price is great  and the service is amazing  Great job and great concept   They have very tasty gluten free crust!,?
294872,Amazing! Do the food journey  trust your waiter to make selections and you will NOT be disappointed  Loved our experience!!,?
295030,Amazing! Food was great and the service even better  I had the chicken Parm witch was very fresh and my date has the pesto chicken  The menu is just the right size  Great place to watch the World Cup!,?
295104,Amazing! Got a shellac manicure  and the price was great  The woman who did my nails was so sweet  very detail oriented  and was very welcoming  I work outside in the dirt and stuff and the nails have not chipped or scratched at all  I also recieved a drink (didnt even need to ask)  When I went to the bathroom  they were spotless just as the entire store was  Everything was fresh and clean  Would come here again in a heartbeat!,?
295409,Amazing! I has such a good experience here especially since it was my first time getting a brazilian  When your laying out on the table spread eagle with someone ripping hair out where it shouldnt be ripped out its hard to be comfortable  Bree was great  she instantly put me at ease by making small talk and getting down to business  Perhaps the most awkward is when they flip you on all fours   that cant be an attractive position but i guess it gets the job done  The salon itself is very nice and swanky  Everyone is super nice and I love that they are open 7 days a week which makes things that much more convenient  Prices were reasonable  Im definitely hooked ,?
295527,Amazing! I usually come here on Sunday for their happy hours between 35 pm  Buy 1 burrito and get the 2nd half price! Halibut is delicious  Big portions  the small burrito is massive  I can barely finish it! I highly recommend it ,?
295734,Amazing! Lived up to its hype in every way! Pizza was delicious and cooked perfectly  Crust was perfect and the combination of the sauce and toppings was on par ,?
295943,Amazing! Ordered a house margarita  the shrimp and chips and finally the churro ice cream sandwich  Everything was delicious!,?
297561,Amazing!!! Could not be happier with our experience with Dianne and our older kids love her too  Sleeping through the night in only a few days   just as she said  Only thing I wish we did differently  was hire her much sooner ,?
297624,Amazing!!! Got all 3 of the bureks  spinach  cheese and meat  love the meat! but all spectacular! Great people too!,?
297797,Amazing!!! Passing through on my way to California to get cleaned up before starting new job  Everyone was extremely professional and fixed my previous haircut that was   well subpar  Would recommend to check them out,?
298342,Amazing  Ive been there several times  I usually get the #9 Pho w/ brisket & tenderloin and the egg rolls   The broth is slow cooked daily  The herbs are fresh and the pho is delicious   The staff is very friendly and attentive   I live several miles away but its worth the trip even though there are several pho restaurants along the way   Plus there is a great bakery and market nearby to walk around after dinner  They also have delicious tea (hot or iced) which is a nice break from the usual soda pop ,?
302534,Ambiance: A smaller sized restaurant right smack in Roosevelt restaurant scene has 12 tables inside with a long bar  12 tables outside in their shaded patio via the help of some Palo Verde trees  The vibe here is laid back and whimsical  Lots of hot dog inspired art work on the walls  Food: Gourmet hotdogs? Yes  and theyre wonderful  First lets start with the protein  all their meat is nitrate free   YEAH for healthy  You can pick from beef  brat  chicken or veggie dogs  The buns are naan patties  The ingredient list is killer  Just take a breath and jump in  The Bear had peanutbutter  gouda and crackerjacks   somehow it just works and I totally dig it  The sunny has fried peaches or pear  prosciutto arugula and honey  equally delicious Price/Service: 8/9 bucks for agourmet hotdog is reasonable  Service is always great Overall: Gourmet hotdogs with a lot of healthy options  whats not to like!,?
302975,Ambience was amazing Service was adequate Prices were expensive  which is not an issue if the food was amazing  Chips and salsa  a 9Ceviche was a 7Enchiladas  I could have paid $10 and been satisfied with quality but at $48  they were less than average  Not sure how this chef is famous but the food is not worth coming back for   ,?
303888,Americanized Mexican fast food  Not cheap  Food was served cold  Tortilla shells tasted like MCDs flour tortillas  Worst pico de gallo I have ever tasted  The tomatoes were grainy and unripened  No Mexican would ever step foot in that place  Hot sauces are gimmicky   Some very nice employees though  Everyone working there is smiling Would not go again ,?
304553,Amy & Jason always makes sure Im taken care of! It was nice to start my birthday morning here as they help get me ready for my wedding tomorrow! Lia,?
305308,An OK building and excellent amenities! The buildings are very noisy  there is a lot of trashy people living there (strippers  pornstars  drug dealers  etc ) Additionally  the management and the way the building is run is a complete joke   I have never dealt with such incompetent people in my life ,?
305427,An absolute 5star rating for their $1 taco special    While I cant speak for the rest of the menu  Ive come for their taco specials many  many times and am always extremely satisfied tastewise  moneywise  and volumewise  The meat options are consistently delicious  but I didnt really like the vegetable taco (probably just me being a meat lover)  The place itself is clean and has nice interior decor  One of my favorite parts is all the salsa flavors available at no extra cost you just have to ask the workers for extra plastic cups if you need more and theyll gladly give you them!,?
306548,An amazing gem my wife and I found on yelp the food was delicious and amazing  The staff were really cool and friendly especially Rey he not only gave us a little extra food he sat with us and gave us detailed directions around the city since were not from around the area  He even went over the menu with us to help us pick out our meal definitely a great spot to come too ,?
306801,An amazing salon!  Lucky to find a salon that is affordable  close to home and has good hairstylists  Finally  Love that it doesnt break the bank  Everyone is super nice   Highly recommend it and will now be going there permanently  My hair looks awesome   It was done as a color correction   Sarah was my stylist and she did an amazing job  Cant wait to go back ,?
307090,An authentic MexiCal burrito joint  very fresh and tasty   This place is MUCH better than Burrito Boyz or Big Fat Burrito   Warning though: spicy here means with slices of jalapeno included!,?
307838,An epic gut bomb  not too far from the Olympic Park   Not the cheapest fancy french fries in the world  but worth a splurge ,?
307857,An establishment I always drop by when the husband makes his way to June Records  Empire Espresso is a small  yet cozy cafe   Not only is it a comfortable little joint  its beverages are really delicious   In addition to the basic coffee  Americans  etc   they have specialty beverages like honey lavender latte (which I tried  and it is definitely interesting!)   Check out Empire Espresso if you are ever in the area! Note: the bathroom is located downstairs  be careful of the narrow passageway ,?
307966,An excellent airport  Thanks a ton for FREE WIFI xD Big sign boards which are helpful to go in a right direction and the bathrooms were clean Overall  a great experience ,?
308681,An extremely large spider was in my car while I was driving  I called Green Home (after pulling over  of course) since I use them for my house and they came out to help  They worked with me on the price since this was an eccentric request  My exterminator  Jake  was awesome and super nice  He tried really hard to find the spider and was conscientious about where and what he sprayed in my car  Really grateful for their help today ,?
308714,An great facility! Seth & Stephen are welcoming and determined to get you the results you are striving for  They keep you accountable by making sure you come in and follow your meal plan  Both are always available for questions and concerns  The other members are like a family and there to help you in anyway possible  I highly recommend TPT to anyone wanting results and a place you enjoy going to each day ,?
308922,An illconceived plan makes this museum an awkward  directionless  highly selective trip through the History of Musicians Who Donated Stuff Its understandable that they cant include everyone   However  my recent visit gave me the revelation that someone dropping in from another planet could conceivably leave this place and not know much (or anything) about the contributions of the Beatles  the Stones  etc   Im not referring to their contributions of artifacts  but the impact they had on R&R Meanwhile  they waste wall space on crap like Jimi Hendrixs childhood drawings of football players and Jim Morrissons elementary school report card Thats an inexcusable crime   We left thoroughly disappointed ,?
308956,An impressive variety of beers to choose from  available in flights of up to 5 beers  The catch? The beers werent that great and the prices were extreme  $19 post tax / pre tip for a flight is pretty extreme!Now Ill give them credit for the fact they had many different styles and even some weird experimental things like marijuana beer which Im guessing they drop hop with herb and thus increases the costs  but either way  I left underwhelmed with most of my selections  Im also not sold on the atmosphere of the place  and my bartender was pretty cold and inattentive  While I dont speak french  I know she spoke english  and while Im fine sitting at a bar without conversation  I felt zero engagement at all from the time of sitting down to the time of asking for my bill (without even being asked about another drink order)  Overall  pretty a pretty meh experience that Ill be skipping on my next trip to town ,?
308979,An impulse stop for Thai food netted a great dining experience  Very friendly staff  quick service  and tasty food  We will return here ,?
311059,Anasazi Foundation is one of the greatest companies Ive ever had the opportunity to work for  I did a short stint as a Trail Walker and it changed my life  Anyone who has the means to contribute to this charity  wouldnt make a better investment in our youth  I have seen many lives changed as a result of this program Considering the type of program it is  I was also very impressed with the way it was run  Ezekiel  one of the founders of the program  takes an active part in the programs and works directly with the family members of youth who attend Definitely a worthy youth rehabilitation program ,?
311262,And again!! This is becoming a new norm    This time I decided to venture out of my safety zone (though not too far) and ordered the ceremonial matcha latte with soy milk  As the soy milk is sweetened  I asked them to not add any sugar It  Was  Fantastic! Though the matcha flavour could have been stronger  and the residue collected at the bottom of the cup  making the texture grainy  it was still fantastic  Im thinking of trying their turmeric latte next time!,?
311733,And you can *rent* a firearm to fire? I loved the cleanliness  the size of the facility and the electricmotored targets  The lanes are  however  pretty tightly packed in here  I didnt see anything to police up my brass into just a big rubber squeegie to push it around  I like to clean as I shoot so as not to step all over casings as Im squeezing off rounds  so that was my only bitch about the lanes If its firearm/LEO/military related and you need it   I think its here  This is the only place Ill shoot in the Valley unless you show me something thats just wayyyyy better  Go for it ,?
311804,Andie helped us buy our 1st home  He made something that seemed impossible happen  He went above and beyond exceeding our expectations  Recommend him 100%,?
312024,Andrea gave me great service when I came in  I ordered a pepperoni pizza bagel and its absolutely delicious  I will definitely be coming back ,?
312347,Andrew at Inkdroppers always worked hard to fulfill my orders promptly and completely even when I moved the goal posts and expectations multiple times  They provided great service and went the extra mile for us  Highly recommended ,?
312401,Andrew helped me to set up this wonderful outing/happy hour for my colleagues after a long day of helping to set up Uptown Charlotte for the Pride Parade   We had apps  lots of cold  frosty drinks  a shady place to rest  and a wonderful and attentive server who made us feel right at home!  Thank you so much for welcoming a bunch of tired  smelly workers!!  We LOVED the food and drinks  the atmosphere was relaxed and lovely  and we WILL be back soon!!,?
312860,Andy  Chad and the whole team at Fanco on Tenaya have been great   They were very helpful in suggesting and coaching us on the six fans we have purchased over the last couple months as part of our renovation project   The Electrician is installing them as a type and I can only hope that the products are as fantastic as the guys at Fanco were to work with during the purchasing phase ,?
313039,Angel is so rude  lazy and disrespectful   I go to this location almost daily and typically the staff is friendly  Unfortunately  I had to interact with some guy named Angel and my previous impression quickly flew out the window   The pump I used wasnt working so I went inside to let them know  I was expecting them to check their system or the pump   but instead I was met with hostility  Angel kept saying its my car without ever verifying if anything was wrong with the pump or their system  Another customer had to interject and tell him to drop his attitude  He rolled his eyes like a little girl and said whatever  I said fine Im calling your corporate office and he replied the number is on the door so call them   I was completely baffled   Other customers apologized to me saying it was ridiculous  I decided to leave before I got upset  Needless to say  I filled up at 7eleven up the street  As much as I like the girls that work there  I will not be back as long as he is there ,?
313238,Angela is amazing! She listened to what I wanted  answered all my questions  and even did some extra styling that wasnt included in the package  Great service and quality for the price!,?
313265,Angela is great! Very personable and knew what she was doing  Her little place is darling and very comfty  Found my new hairstylists ,?
314962,Another Bucks Uptown   things you need to know about this location!Decent amount of street (metered) parking availableThe line can get loooooong  but the staff moves fastNot a ton of seating inside  but seems to be enough for the folks who are hanging aroundMy chai latte was pretty thin  but that can completely depend on the barista  of courseThe staff are quite friendly  offer to warm up your coffee cake and get those items out to you in record time For a quick cup of joe in Gateway Village  this Starbucks is aok ,?
315497,Another Home Run !! Wonderful staff and great food  You thinking of opening a business  follow their business plan  Each location runs like clockwork  An awesome experience each time at every location !! An absolute pleasure  Juliana  Jordan Emma and Jeff were great as was Chip the manager   Doing yourself a disservice if you dont come in !!,?
315559,Another Liberty Village lunch staple  Cute decoration (love their glass)  dimly lit place  nice open patio to eat outside  Suffering the same problem as their Japanese cuisine neighbour InJapan in that their food is highly forgettable  I wouldve given this place a 3 5 though just because their glass noodles has some flavour and chicken cutlet is a little bigger  Also purple rice On Ritual ,?
315741,Another Starbucks in Mississauga Great location lots of parking  Its in the middle of all the condos The staff is great super fast service   They even have great seating  ,?
316537,Another buffet spot to add to the Indian scene in the university area   I didnt see a menu so I think they offer the buffet all day everyday  of course I could be wrong   The restaurant is laid out very nicely which was quite impressive  however I found the limited buffet to be just ok   I like more of a variety and Spice Cafe just didnt deliver for me on this visit   I realize theyre still pretty new so Ill give them another try in a couple of months in hopes that they add a bit more to choose from ,?
316714,Another consistent order from Lis Asian  this place deserves a lot more credit for their tasty food! If youre thinking of getting some Asian take out  please eat here  you wont regret it!,?
316908,Another delectable dinner at CUs preeminent sushi powerhouse!  Tonights favorites were the steamed shrimp dumplings and the playgirl sushi   Outstanding waitstaff for our 9 diners which included 4 kids   Definitely worth our 45 minute wait!,?
317537,Another favorite in my BFs neighborhood   Ive only been to the Bar NoRTH location   Great place to just sit outside on a gorgeous day  sip cocktails  eat appetizers and chat    I have not made it past pizza and cocktails but the limited exposure ive had to the food/cocktails/people/service/location  all excellent ,?
318461,Another great dinner with neighbors  Am beginning to feel like a pimp for them  but cant think of a better place with which to be associated Superior service  excellent food and portions and a bar that excels   Owner greets all guests and dont get in the way as HE wants to seat the ladies in your party   Give him the thrill   He is a charmer and puts everyone at ease We have about four dinners under our belts and will add to them on an ongoing basis   It is truly a great restaurant and experience ,?
318628,Another great experience from the front desk checkin process to the doctor herself  Reminder  they are available Saturdays AND Sundays and this is why I will continue to come to this office for years to come  Ive never had to wait very long and theyve always been accommodating as I always has my son with me  Dr  Davis provides the most ocular health information during an exam of any other doctor Ive ever been to and Im truly grateful  She even read my medical history and noticed I made a mistake  Oooops  wrong box  Im still as impressed with this office as my first review and I will continie to recommend people to visit her  I do not get my glasses at visionworks as I prefer a much more economical place like eyeglass world but Im beyond happy with the doctors service ,?
318997,Another great meal and experience at Chelseas   Tried something new this time  seared ahi tuna tacos   The tuna was so fresh  delish peanut sauce & the guacamole tasty    But the star of the meal just may have been the kale salad   Just the sound of kale salad may send some running but this was unbelievable   Service top notch as always from the young  attractive & personable wait staff ,?
319300,Another great place to visit in the Melrose area along 7th Ave (this place is located on Indian School Rd)  Park in the back I found some cool items in this Antique Mall  Its just the right size   not too big and not too cramped  Its not junky either  Items are nicely arranged in the booths with tasteful appeal  (come buy me!)I liked the open and high ceilings   like being in a wearhouse  SUPER friendly service   and Hollywood Regency is moving here next week!!,?
319667,Another hard one to rate for me   Because the fact of the matter is  nothing beats The Good Egg for a simple  quick  satisfying breakfast   But is there anything special about it?  Not even a little bit   I want to give it 4  because for me  for my breakfast wants  I would be happy to go there every weekend   But I cant do that in good conscience  for the following reasons:  Its not a place to linger  because they sling you into a table and throw your food at you super quickly   I also have to honest and say that every time Ive had lunch there  its been terrible   For what it is  it does feel a teeny overpriced   And theres zero atmosphere   This is the first time Ive really agonized over wanting that half star!  Ive got nothing bad to say about The Good Egg  just nothing good   Not when there are places like Palatte and Switch   So for those mornings when you just want to get in and fill your belly  go for it!,?
319781,Another hole in a wall place  The menu is straight forward  The food is really good! The portions are large very satisfied with this place ,?
319895,Another incredible meal at Yasu   The waitress surprised me when I was too torn to decide amongst the plethora of choices   Well done Madeleine   One of the most fantastic pieces of fish Ive ever experienced   The dessert  the sushi  the service   all was sublime   Thank you ,?
320154,Another meal so good we went back twice in our one week trip  and we were staying on Fremont  The sesame crusted salmon was huge and scrumptious  Chocolate lava cake also a musteatService is fair  but the food alone makes this a fourstar meal ,?
320775,Another outstanding breakfast with superb service! Eddie was our waiter and his attention to detail is what I like to see  To top it off  I won a dessert for checking in!!,?
321200,Another poster put it best  Its the Irish version of Hooters  Although I would rate Tilted Kilt a little classier and cleaner than a Hooters  The waitresses are good to look at and the beer is cold  although a bit pricey  We didnt try the food  but I didnt have much to complain about ,?
322171,Another trip to Old World deli and as always NOT a disappointment   Their Gyros are killer and the sauce is awesome! The owner was so nice! We walked in about 2 minutes before closing not knowing they close early on Saturday  No problem they cheerfully made us two king size gyro meals to go (King size has #1 of meat  no kidding) We also got some of their traditional  Greek style baklava and the Lebanese style   All wrapped up well and out we went happily on our way back to Parma  It was still hot when we got home   My son and I enjoyed our gyros and there was plenty of mine left to share with my two small dogs  they loved it too! Needless to say there will be many trips to OLD WORLD deli in the future  Great Job  only wish you were a little closer ,?
322650,Another wonderful experience under the tender touch of a very capable hygienist  In addition to competent caring dental work  the office staff is friendly and efficient  The Doctor always makes me feel confident in the care he provides  My hygienist is a lovely lady with a gentle touch  The plan for uninsured patients has meet all our needs Weve been patients for over 5 years  This plan has always met our needs and budget  They never invent extra work and have in fact worked with us to keep our costs down ,?
322658,Another wonderful local eatery  I loved the cinnamon biscuits with star berry jam  The chicken fried steak was excellent and the plate was very large  Eat has some amazing gravy to go on top of it all  Delicious coffee too!,?
322979,Anthony Vigil is crazy good at color  especially on blondes! Hes Scottsdales blonde expert   Ive gotten nothing but great comments on my cut and color every time I get back from the salon  He also specializes in Brazilian Blowouts and hair extensions   His clientele consists of seriously some of the prettiest girls in Scottsdale that Ive ever seen! If you dont believe me  check out his Instagram: HairbyAnthony and check it out for yourself  Happy coloring!,?
323121,Anthony does mine and my girlfriends blonde hair color  Looks outstanding every time  Pays attention to detail and always makes sure its perfect  Its also a riot to listen to his stories! Ha would recommend to  anyone  Does a great job on women too!!,?
323140,Anthony has opened another masterpiece! He and the gals are super friendly  the salon is GORGEOUS  and there are cocktails! I wont ever go anywhere else to get my nails done!,?
323418,Anthropologie is one of my favorite retailers  and even though I was excited about the opening of this store (a year or two ago?)  I lived so close to the Mt Lebanon location that I never stopped by  Anyway  I moved in the spring  and finally checked out this store with my best friend in September  Five minutes into my shopping experience  I asked myself  Why havent I come to this location before?! This store feels a lot bigger than the Mt Lebanon one  and the sales associates were very helpful (unlike the colder associates I had experienced in the south hills)  After my friend and I had both picked up several items  we were quickly greeted by associates who started us fitting rooms Sadly  we didnt find much  I purchased a fabric handbag and some furniture knobs  but I definitely plan on returning some time soon!,?
323497,Antique  Vintage & Contemporary!Way  waaaaay cool stuff in this place  And  all is priced to sell  The proprietor told me he prices as he does to keep his offerings fresh  he doesnt want stuff sitting around collecting dust  He wants you to come back and to see new stuff when you do  Im east side (Geauga County) and this place is worth the drive for sure  I scored a killer tiffany floor lamp  a mirror for above my fireplace and an ax!Highly recommend!,?
323619,Antonio is a great sales rep   Great service  Patience  Great customer service  We went to look for cars for my brother  He had all his time for us  We felt very happy ,?
324589,Any window replacement company that doesnt do a free estimate isnt worth my time Most smart shoppers get several quotes to make sure they arent getting ripped off and to get a feel for the company   We have an entire house that needs complete window replacement frames/windows etc  it is an older home (1951) and to send out a guy was $50 00 to just give us a quote ,?
324620,Anybody that gives this place a good score is just a shill They only sell coins sight unseen   I bought two coins graded MS63  The coins I received were bag beat  dirtyand scared  Definitely low quality coins that I paid too much for  Dont be fooled by their scam of paying before you see the coin  If they cant afford to carry an inventoryyou dont want to do business there ,?
324695,Anyone can make a pizza  This place has perfected it!  Perfect crust  fresh toppings  excellent customer service   Kid approved!  Lunch special is excellent   Two slices and a drink for $4 95 ,?
324779,Anyone giving this place more than two stars does not know a good burger     The cheapest burger with the most filling available is what they are buying   It is barely meat   The charbroil is what gives it any taste ,?
325367,Anyone who knows what Greek food should taste like should avoid this place  not good at all  The Gyro reminded me of something one might get at a gas station  you know  next to the 3 day old hot dogs and pump cheese  This is not Gyro meat  it is some kind of Gyro looking meat but is most certainly not the real deal  Charging what you do for the cheap food you provide is reason enough for me not to come back or recommend to anyone  Very disappointing ,?
325372,Anyone who likes poutine has got to try this Poutine Restaurant Very Welcoming and rustic  decor   Staff was pleasant and attentive to our needs  ( we asked to put the pickles on the side and not in our smoked meat poutine)   Food (poutine) was amazing   Five of us took 4 different styles of Poutine so we could try some of the varieties amongst ourselves   I had the Smoked meat poutine  cant recall the name on the menu  but it was very  very good  a must try   I had tasted the Pulled pork Poutine  honestly that is my next choice next time I go   All and all a must stop for poutine lovers Bravo to the Staff ,?
326102,Anytime my family and I are on the east side of town  and we have a little bit of free time  we stop in and play a few games here   The breadth of the games available is incredible from very old machines to more current pinball games themed after bands or movies or TV shows   They even have some of the games I grew up with in the 1980s  like Donkey Kong  Galaga  Centipede  Dig Dug  and Pac Man   Ah    the memories   This is a great place for adults and kids alike  and you will be occupied for as many quarters as you are willing to sink into the machines   Also  the owners knowledge about electronics and the care he puts into the renovation of some of these machines is aweinspiring   He has always been quietly friendly  and watching him work is always a learning experience   What a great place    a mustsee in Las Vegas for adults and families ,?
326731,Apparently Im in the minority here  but this place is pretty good   Great salad bar with many items    Some lower cost options to pair with the salad bar and you end up with a $1315 dinner with all youcan eat salad bar    I end up taking my entree home most of the time    Clean and friendly ,?
327219,Apparently theres quite a bit of buzz around Banh Mi Boys  so on my last trip through Toronto I stopped in to have a Kalbi beef sandwich and some sweet potato fries  Im gonna keep this short and sweet  the food is decent  Some people think its all OMGWTFBBQ  but I mean  its a sandwich thats decentlypriced and tastes good  The sweet potato fries were just a touch too greasy  but thats ok  I guess  Its a small place and its crowded and noisy when its busy (which is    always)  Its a nice place to drop in for a quick togo order  Ill be back ,?
327371,Apparently this is a chain restaurant but given my expectations   Staff were exceptionally friendly  the hostess  Bobby at the sushi bar  and my waiter   Free sample of cold soup (dont know the name) and free edamame at the sushi bar was a nice surprise   Sushi rolls were big  delicious and well presented   A nice reverse happy hour at night made many items cheaper   Waiter was very attentive and brought me new water every time I was finishing my current glass   On the menu  most items had bright pictures so there would be no ambiguity about what you were ordering   And they had a sake bar (which Ill have to check out another time)   Ill go back!,?
328512,Appointment ran late  45 minutes past my appointment time  Front desk assistants and vision assistants are friendly  Dr  Johnson soso on bedside manner ,?
328709,Approvals!!!This place reminds me of Katzs from NYC  Although I would say Katz is a tad better in terms of taste  I guess the prices kind of make up for it since Katz is like $1516 a sandwich and here the sandwich is $10  The sizes are pretty much the same  we got a ton of meat here too I am not an Earls fan so I would recommend this place over Earls any day!,?
328933,April and Maria were amazing! No waiting time and great customer service! They took the time to explain the account and perks offered to members and answered all of our questions  I appreciate them taking the time give a genuine smile   it goes a long way with customers!,?
329691,Arctic Bites is amazing! Luckily I caught them when they were at Adelaide Eats  The rolled ice cream always tastes light and fresh  Plus its really fun to watch the staff make the rolled ice cream ,?
329774,Are here a few days after it opened! Our waitress Karen was amazing  she came out from Georgia just to help open the new store  She went above and beyond to get our whole party  4 adults and 2 kids  exactly what we needed  Food was on point  even with a lot of modifications and ordering of things custom made  Definitely will go back ,?
331532,Arghh  I wanted to like this place more than I do  I went here with a friend to do the $30 manipedi deal  we had booked an appointment so we got seated right away which was nice  The two women who did our nails were nice  but the lady who worked on my friends nails was much more meticulous  taking time to make sure she was happy with everything  The lady who worked on my nails went through everything quickly  resulting in very thin polish application which began chipping just later that day  I wasnt as happy with my nails as with other places I have gone before  but I feel like it was a hit or miss situation based on the person I got  One thing that I enjoyed about Nailing more than any other place Ive gone  however  are their massage chairs  They are incredible and have like a million functions  Best massage chairs Ive experienced at any manipedi place thus far ,?
331766,Argus is where its at! Theyre menu is neverending  with a wide variety of vegetarian options to choose from Exceptionally friendly interaction between the employees and their patrons  Argus has a sort of Cheers feel to it  They could use a bit more space to accommodate such a fantastic crowd of people  though ,?
331878,Aria is a beautiful hotel & casino with great customer service  Check in/out was easy  restaurant & bar service was always attentive  breakfast room service was amazing  our room was very clean & we could control lights/drapes with a bedside control panel  We enjoyed a great day at the pool/hot tubs on comfortable lounge chairs with great pool side food & bar service  The taxi valet & bell hop were fantastic  Aria is in a great location without being in the midst of the heaviest of foot traffic  Check out the tram service for a fun little jaunt  Our only complaint was the soft bed that was a little lumpy (room 4121)  Overall  a great place to stay and feel pampered ,?
332157,Arirang is a good spot for lunch or dinner for families  The food is fresh but fails to deliver on the taste and flavour in the meats  This restaurant has great friendly service and is always please to serve you  I would recommend this to families ,?
332403,Arizona Science Center  deserves better   The  Cafe doesnt serve coffee or tea   What a silly joke if it werent so sad!  People need to TRUST that no one business is going to unilaterally change the definition of the word  CAFE to not include a hot cup of coffee or tea   False advertising,?
333872,Arrived at 7:30 pm on Customer Appreciation Day only to wait at the counter for about five minutes while I watched about 12 people running around like chickens with their heads cut off   I made eye contact with several of them several times but they just continued running around without acknowledging me   Then finally someone came up to me to let me know that they ran out of the $1 subs but they could sell them to me at full price   They also referred me to another location that was still honoring the promotion   Honoring is right!I just walked out   I read the website and it didnt say anything about while supplies last   It just said from 48 pm at participating locations   After this  Ill never be back again!Thanks for showing Customer Appreciation!,?
334063,Arrived at around 8:45 pm on a Saturday  there wasnt a crowd  Actually it was pretty clear  The wait staff is so knowledgeable about the flavors of the menu  and the wine/cocktail menu  refreshing  I will be back   so freakin good!,?
334148,Arrived at the bar area around 9:30pm on a Saturday  There was one other couple there  while a few others trickled in    not busy at all  Unfortunately our food took at least halfanhour from the time we placed our order   It actually may have been longer  but we chose not to stick around  Most of the staff was watching the Cavs game  so that may have been the cause of the delay  Not the type service I would expect  which is too bad ,?
334206,Arrived at the very end of the day on Sunday but still full $8 parking and full $16 entry (way overpriced)  even though some vendors had started packing up   They wont take the $1 coupon on your phone like virtually every other place on the planet so had to pay full price The vendors I was looking for either werent there or didnt have what I wanted  All in all $24 flushed down the toilet and an hour of wasted driving while still noticing many of the prices are high The only people making out seem to be Crossroads  since they charge a steep admission and also charge the booth vendors   I say save your time and money  since you can most likely do better The sad part is that many of the vendors are great people and Crossroads is hurting their booth attendance with the ridiculous admission price   If they even cut the price down to $10  more people would come  causing the vendors to sell more ,?
335436,Arrogant  poor bedside manner  and disrespectful! Has no patience with children with dental anxiety  Needs to go back to engineering and get out of the medical field! Please research him thoroughly before you decide to visit this horrible pediatric dentist! Numerous parents have reported the same experience    take a look at the online reviews and see for yourself ,?
335637,Art is amazing  very friendly and knowledgeable  Very honest and nice  felt like I made a new friend in a couple hours  Quick service as well  new wheels are going to arrive and installed the next day ready for pick up  Cant go wrong with this place ,?
336413,As I am allergic to ginseng I didnt try Koryos chicken soup but went for the other items on their menu  Overall staff were friendly  Food came promptly  Restaurant was nice and clean  Food was hot upon arrival  FoodHot stone bulgogi rice  came with chicken broth soup (flavourful with a herbal taste)  The stone pot kept the rice nice and warm while forming sticky rice giving it an extra crunch  The flavours of the bulgogi wasnt too strong nor overly salty/sweet  Could use a little more cause  Beef was tender though  Seafood pancake  I really enjoyed this  Not too oily with a tiny crunch from the pan fried edges  Good amount of spring onions and enough seafood to satisfy the tastebuds  Tofu soup with seafood  this dish for me at first didnt taste hot but the chilli flakes start to creep up on you  Can use a little more seafood but the tofu was greatNonetheless would love to come back and try other dishes,?
336678,As I go through the car wash in three minutes flat  I ask myself why did I ever wash my car by hand!!! The staff here is  friendly and  very helpful  This is the only place I get my car washed!,?
337014,As I read through the majority of the reviews  theyre all pointing in the same general direction; this place/location sucks! The wife brought dinner home for the fam and the food was just disgusting  plain & simple  The burgers were smashed  literally  You could tell not one ounce of care or pride went into the prep of the meals  According to the wife  the place was dead so  the preparation wasnt rushed  the cooks just dont give a shit  I have eaten at other locations & the quality was far better  Pass on this location!,?
338074,As Ive shifted to avoiding terrestrial vertebrate meat unless I know its provenance  I wanted to update my recommendations:  I now am loving the veggie burger ding dong style  which means with shredded cabbage  chunky peanut butter  and sriracha sauce   The burger itself is bean based  but gets a great crunchy outside that goes well with the smooth interior   I will still usually pair it with the tuna melt for that amazing ginger kick ,?
338632,As a California native  Im so here for authentic and lowpriced  and I judge anything that claims to be authentic with a fierce side eye   Los Gemelos wins  and is literally the key to my soul  Tucked in a cute little store  you walk in (grab some mexican candy cuz duh)  sit down  get some chips and salsa for the free free  and chow down  Love this place more than any other restaurant in Madison ,?
339114,As a Las Vegas local  I actually have NOT seen Celines show before! Saw this concert the second day back in concert after her husbands passing and after her brief hiatus to take of the funeral  All I can say is WOW  A few moments you could tell were very difficult for her because of the loss she just suffered  but still  the concert was incredible  I wouldnt call myself a Celine fan     But my girlfriend definitely is  And we BOTH Really enjoyed the show  shes that good!Celine was struggling on a few of the charts I could tell  but other times she was so strong and perfect it was incredible  Even for an off night when she is recuperating from the death of her husband  Celine STILL outshines most performers out there today  An incredible show  An incredible voice  and just an all around genuine performer  A definite see!,?
340307,As a brunch enthusiast  I had high hopes for this place  but I was disappointed  There were wasps everywhere  We relocated to the back of the restaurant where it was a tight squeezedirectly in the path of servers and customers trying to pass through  Headsup: there is no A/C and it was quite stuffy They ran out of several key toppings: avocados  Nutella  ice cream  and something else (I cannot recall at the moment)  The baked beans come out of a Heinz can  They use Kraft singles instead of real cheese  I ordered the waffles Benny and though it was fairly decent  the service was lacking and it marred the experience  When my friend voiced some concerns  the server seemed defensive and patronizing  Great concept  poor execution  I cannot speak to the other locations  but needless to say  we will not be returning to this one ,?
340450,As a buyer  this place is great   There are always oneofakind items   you can bid in person or online   Every employee has been super nice ,?
341362,As a fellow community member I am very upset that when I walk into menchies they do not remember me  I am a frequent customer   constantly being asked if I have a smile card bothers me  Of course I do  5/10 review ,?
342786,As a hotel attached to an international airport you should review your policies  I flew in on a red eye and wanted to land  book a room and get some rest from my jet lag  Your front desk agent told told me he could not check anyone in at 6am so I had to come back at 9am  Terrible service for business travelers,?
343227,As a local here in Vegas  I have seen pretty much all the shows on the Strip  We decided to see this one because my boyfriend and I were staying at the Luxor for a night  There was a ticket special going on for locals (30% off!) as well as a coupon inside our coupon book we were given a checkin  We got tickets to that evenings nearlysoldout show at a great price The show itself was wonderful  with high energy and a lighter twist to it  It is humorous as well as a perfect showcase for these incredibly talented dancers  There were spectacular routines and amazing light enhancements that came together to make an allaround fantastic show that was definitely worth the money I was so impressed that I went back today and bought a tshirt  :),?
343246,As a local its important to have great local bars! Not only is the food great but the service is amazing! Shannon  Rhonda  Joe  Casey  Mikki  Josh  all call this place home they remember you each time you walk in and you feel right at home! Its a great place to grab a drink and watch the game or have dinner!,?
344048,As a music venue  Beachland is excellent  Its just that right size where it feels intimate  but not small  The sound is good  and the adjacent bar is well stocked  The only thing that annoys me is for quieter concerts  people still throw their glass bottles into trash cans right next to the stage  making a huge clatter  Even the artists notice  Still  this place actually has quieter bands  unlike say the Grog Shop The food is also very good  The Pizza Bread is perfect bar food  Many people have raved about brunch at the tavern  We finally went  and it was decent  The Breakfast Burrito was excellent  as were the Bloody Marys  Sometimes the Tavern and Ballroom have different shows with different tickets  Other nights  you can walk in and out of the Tavern without a problem  In that case  the Tavern bar has a lot more beers on draft  and faster service ,?
344507,As a newbie to Thai cuisine  I cannot compare this to any other Thai places  This particular restaurant had an interesting interior design and was very spacious with high ceilings and ropes that suspended the lighting up in the air and cut across the restaurant  The food we ordered was a spicy soup  green curry  and a noodle dish that was chewy and flavorful  The spicy soup though was my favorite since I love spicy foods  lemongrass  and veggies  The green curry had the right amount of spice and tender chicken  The only thing I didnt like about it was the higher price but hey its Vegas in a nice hotel/casino so what do you expect right?,?
345082,As a place to meet with other people for discussion  I give 2 this venue stars because people can have fun and laugh with their friends and talk   But as a result  no one else can hear who they are sitting with at other tables  because the sounds are magnified like a megaphone  pinging off the hard walls and floor Also the chairs here are hardwood and super painful for my bony butt   I had to go to the car to get my 99 Cents Only Store foam chair cushion So if you want to meet and discuss things at this Starbucks  there are other places that are more comfortable  that even have couches  and not sooooo loud ,?
345464,As a recent transplant to the area  I tried this place my first Sunday morning in town and absolutely loved it  There are few things in life I enjoy more than a great breakfast! That being said  I have been back every Sunday since for breakfast  An unusual selection of great foods  with great flavor  Love the chicken sausage  love the oatmeal pancakes  Good coffee too  Friendly service  I also love the decor  its very kitschy and cool all at the same time Im a fan  for certain!,?
345665,As a resident here in Vegas   its one of the best Dim Sum restaurants in town  For out of town Yelpers   no need to look further for your Dim Sum fix  This place dont open till 10 or 10:30am and Dim Sum isnt served all day  Weekends can get a bit crowded so get there early ,?
346546,As a transplant to vegas from the Midwest  This is a A White Castle  Very busy   very busy   oh did I mention that it is very busy   If youre not a fan of crowds  I recommend not going to this location or sending someone In for you  Why did they put the only one on the strip  The strip sucks   I hope that we get one off the strip ,?
348440,As an Indian  I normally cant justify going to a pricey Indian restaurant & paying for food that either I can cook at home myself or that my mom or an aunt can cook for me  But  in the last few months  Ive found myself at Blue Taj twice (once with coworkers for lunch  and once for an anniversary celebratory dinner) Both times  I was impressed by the food  the ambiance and the service  I still believe its expensive  and may be not entirely worth the money you pay   but its not complaint worthy  Its worth visiting at least once  specially since I havent found or heard of any other good Indian restaurants in the Charlotte area ,?
348575,As an administrative assistant  I deal with numerous companies for various things for both home and business  I have used 34 different carpet cleaning companies before finding Royal Carpet Care and will continue to use this company for all future personal and business related jobs  I requested an estimate around 5pm the previous evening and Greg replied within the hour and was able to schedule me in the next morning in my desired time frame  He was on time and is very professional  personable and treats your home with respect  as if it were his  Ive had some companies damage parts of my home (scuffs on walls  little dings on the doors) and not take responsibility for it  I have two dogs and Greg left my carpet looking new again  Affordable price for awesome service  Would recommend to anyone ,?
348829,As an avid ramen fan  I was thrilled to see another ramen restaurant open up in Tempe  I drove past the first 2 nights and saw long lines for the grand opening and decided to come back on Thursday  I ordered the Hachi Special and I have to say for $15 dollars after tip  I expected more  The broth was underwhelming  the noodle portion was small  and not really the type of ramen noodle I expected  The redeeming qualities were the 3 pieces of char sui pork  and the soft boiled egg  Although the portion of pork was nice  it seemed to be undercooked and just not very hot  Even after being in the soup  Overall  I think I would go back and try a different ramen bowl  But if its anything like this experience  I will stick with tampopo or Dozo  The best place I have had Ramen in AZ btw  is Hot Noodles and Cold Sake in Scottsdale ,?
349017,As an increasingly critical coffee snob  theres only one latte in the city worth drinking and thats redline  If youre so inclined an artisan chorizo egg sandwich or lush carrot muffin will pair magnificently  #makemondays better,?
349491,As authentic and delicious as they come  Cash only and very simple and savory  Needed to find a pho place for a quick lunch in between meetings and did a search  Theres two right next to each other a newer flashier one that does viet Thai cuisine  and this place  The yelp reviews (hehe) seemed positive so I parked and walked in  Right away saw the kind of dated and antique dining area with textbook family owned and operated feel and Vietnamese everywhere  Ordered the large house special  which was #7  and it was only $7 50!Very fresh tasting with lots of meat and noodles  Lots of spices and fresh herbs  Under $9 total  Left a $10  Cash only but worth it if youre walking by or need something to warm up and fill your stomach  Would come back for a quick lunch again ,?
349809,As coffee addicts  my husband and I were nervous about moving and leaving behind our local roastery  Thankfully  we found the Roastery of Cave Creek: http://www roc2 coffee/  We have tried five different kinds so far and love them all  Honestly  it is the freshest cup of coffee weve ever had  Id recommend it highly to anyone who drinks coffee  YUM ,?
351176,As far as buffets go this place is a solid winner   Ive been coming here for several years even before the hotel changed to PH   Although the prices have gone up a bit  the food has stayed consistently good (buffet good that is)   The variety is not the largest but they have a good amount of tasty foods   I would have to say that their dessert lineup is on the weaker side compared to other top notch buffet locations in Vegas   Be sure to try their champagne brunch on the weekends! All you can drink champagne for $3 extra!,?
352561,As former Missouri residents  we have been waiting for a Steak n Shake to open closer to us in Henderson   Great prices and good food   Heres hoping they roll out the breakfast menu ASAP!      EDIT: took them down to 2 stars out of 5 due to our more recent experience with the drive through last week   Fries were undercooked (ewww)  patty melt missing the cheese  cookie dough shake missing cookie dough bits (very very few) and it was melted and the chicken was just OK    not as good as the first visit   Would not have even gotten our fries if my 8 year old daughter wouldnt have asked to be sure they put them in before my husband drove away   Steak n Shake    get it together!!  I want to enjoy this place so badly ,?
352592,As full time RIvers who really like Thai food its often difficult to find good Thai food  Last Wednesday after an appointment in downtown Phoenix we searched Yelp for a Thai Restaurant on our way back to Casa Grande  AZ  We found this restaurant not far off the 10 in Chandler which has recently opened   The service was very friendly   Pricing was very good The restaurant was very clean and welcoming  The Spring Rolls  Fried Pineapple Rice with Chicken was amazing  Since we are Snow Birds we will be back! The new owner is doing a great job and should be very successful ,?
353209,As good as tacos get!Fresh  quick and very reasonably priced   Cant go wrong here       the entire menu is sensational!!!,?
355842,As of late this location is increasingly less helpful  Today the manager refused to accept a $100 bill  I visit this location daily  I tip regularly and spend WAY TO MUCH money here per month to be treated like I am asking for a favor  The worst part is the delivery of their excuse why they wont accept it  My order was over 20 dollars and have never had an issue in times past  Disappointing is one way to describe todays experience!,?
356043,As one ca see from past activity I once was a regular here  Am rather upset that no one told me location was closing  Maybe staff didnt know  but the owner should have told regulars Now I have no way of getting in touch with a couple of the staff  whom I considered friends  If we knew this was coming we would have exchanged contact information!A pox on the owner of this location ,?
356267,As other reviewers have commented  this bar offers a 21 martini deal 127pm Sunday to Thursday  Their official martini list is on the short side but the bartender I had (Darren I think) was more than happy to make a variation on the martini list when I told him what I was looking for in a drink  Hell give you your second martini right away but if youre not impressed with the first hell make you a different one free of charge until you tell me that youre happy with it  Just dont get the Chambord Fleur de Lys: its a martini that sounds delicious but is so sweet that it tastes more like a desert than a martini  Le Central offers good people watching  one of the better martini deals on the Strip  and a casual place to strike up a conversation with a fellow Vegas visitor  However unlike most other casino bars you cant play video poker at the bar  meaning no comped drinks for playing but those other bars probably serve worse drinks so it all evens out ,?
357827,As someone who eats a lot of Indian food  this place was great!  Excellent service and the curries were awesome ,?
357942,As someone who has been to Japan  and is educated on ramen  let me tell you how surprised I was with the superior quality of their tonkatsu ramen  The broth is buttery and amazing  I recommend adding the shiitake mushrooms  Go here!!,?
359331,As soon as you walk in you get hit with a citrus smell  so refreshing! I had the Watermelon Basil Lemonade  which was amazing! If you do not like the drink they offer to adjust it or even remake it I had been driving by here for weeks untilI finally made the stop to try this place  I was definitely not disappointed  Their mason jars are so cute & you get a  50 cent discount when you bring it in with you ,?
359490,As stated by several other reviewers the wait staff is good  especially Jenny  However  as also stated by several the store is kind of old and dingy and really needs a refurbishment  But what this store really needs is management that doesnt have a cranial rectal insertion problem  The most recent on his part is the change in acceptance of the free meal after ten stamps program with no notice and no effective by date  When asked about it he informed me I put it up and no consideration to the fact that I had two cards ready to be used  The equivalent of forty meals purchased considering I always have at least one person with me  Just bad customer service IMHO!Wont be back till this store has new management ,?
360003,As the only real option for a music store in the far NW valley  one would think the owners and staff would be totally on top of their game   Not so   Soso customer service and small facility   Poor communication when teachers are out and inflexible makeup options ,?
360318,As their sign says: Autentica Comida Mexicana  The food  the vibe  the service  all excellent  My friend and fellow yelper John M  and I had quite a feast here  Acting on advice from the reviews I read here  I ordered the seafood enchilada  it was pure ambrosia  loaded with juicy shrimp and fish cooked just right  John had the garlic shrimp and let me try some of it; the shrimp was succulent and the garlic flavor intense  I loved it! Caveat: Im a very big fan of garlic and am one of those people who believe that you can never have too much garlic in a dish  so some of you might find the flavor on the aggressive side if you order it  But I know its what Ill be ordering next time ;)   The generous and tasty house margaritas were a perfect complement to the delightful repast  ,?
360393,As this is an ayce place you cant expect to have top notch food like a specialized restaurant  but in comparison to the other ayce places in Calgary  i found this one to be the most decent   Food portion and taste are consistent so you know exactly what you r getting  Price is the same w other places ($30$33 incl tip and gst per person)  Clean and attentive service  most dishes are spiced well not overly salty or spicy   highly recommend if you got a bad craving for sashimi and sushi!( I do wonder if most ayce places in Calgary r owned by the same owner tho  since concept and menu r so similar??),?
360718,As usual this is a place to bring friends  The staff is young and attractive  The food is average at best but my high score comes from the people who sit at the bar  Its always a fun place to sit and strike up a conversation  I tell my single friends to go here and have fun   Order the 101 burger and leave the steaks to a steakhouse  The best apps are fried   Expect to have fun  not an award winning meal  The Tvs are always on and the employees dance throughout the day  Its always fun to be around happy employees  Jay  the GM  will stop at nothing to ensure you are happy  If youre not  ask for him ,?
361311,As we were driving down my friend had to call ahead  which I thought was odd  She said it was soooo good that sometimes they sell out before the end of the night and we would have to wander the streets hungry!But luckily they still had some pork left  It was my first time and despite the simple 2 item menu I was confused what to get  I got what Porchetta recommended for a first timer  It was delicious! It was so good my friend ordered a second then she compliant about over eating  Thank you Porchetta for contributing to the obesity epidemic  J/K  she would probably over eat at other places as well ,?
363009,Ashley was amazing! She was very attentive and turned my dull hair into a dream! She certainly went above and beyond my expectations  10/10 recommend and will definitely be seeing her again!,?
363569,Aside from Penn & Teller being the best show in Vegas    yada  yada  yada    yeah you know that already  and dont need me to tell you again to go see these guys right now    it must also be acknowledged that Angie  who works at the P&T souvenir store is a wonderful human being who works very hard to please all the patrons and is just the best there is!,?
363910,Aside from the hotness of our waiter  our groups visit here was awful   Half of us didnt have water  the other half didnt have silverware  we had to keep asking for basic things that should be a given  hello!  They also brought us one basket of bread for a table of twelve  which was a bit stingy  dont you think?  The food didnt suit my taste  but the decor was fabulous  so I rolled my eyes and just got through the meal without complaining any further ,?
363912,Aside from the infamous bango night its a great place to come with friends for a few beers  Have also been for other events such as birthday parties  etc  Im not a member but if I lived on the North Side Id definitely join  Located in historic Deutschtown this private establishment has served the community for decades Older but super clean  friendly staff and members  Amazingly cheap prices ,?
363934,Aside from the long wait for service at the Meat & Fish given that every time  the rest of Pick n Save is fairly clean and organized  Theres usually no one stationed at the counter for a very long time and theres no buzzer to try and contact an employee  There was another customer waiting before us and she left because the wait was too long This isnt even the first time that we had to wait an extremely long time in order to get assistance for the meat or fish  Also  pretty sure last time the employee did not wear gloves in handling raw meat  However  the employee that came around to help today was fairly friendly and did wear gloves  Overall  the rest of the store had a decent selection of groceries to shop around for with the sections neatly divided throughout the store  Well organized and decently stocked with a variety of food options to choose from  before I can rate this place any higher  Id say the counters (particularly the meat & fish) need to be better staffed ,?
363938,Aside from the longgg line up  this is definitely the best buffet in vegas  Their quality of food is top notchif youre a meat eater  the prime rib is to die for!! They have a great selection of different ethnic foods  We came here for brunch and they served bottomless mimosas and even fresh squeezed juice!! Evrn though its a tad more expensive than other buffets  I personally think it is worth every penny!,?
364279,Ask for Brad !  Most delightful server we have had in a while   Ask for a Bloody Mary   extra spicy & extra dirty and he made sure the Bartender made it as requested  Our salads were prepared as ordered with the dressing on the side Our entrees were perfect  with my Prime Rib was cooked to order a perfect Medium Rare  Thumbs up to great service & good food  ,?
364290,Ask for Buellers wings   best wings in Scottsdale and probably Phoenix   Servers are friendly and my Moscow Mules are always on point!Just finished a chimichanga that was phenomenal because Carlos is a mean Mexican cook!  Love that guy Great patio area and can always catch any sporting event Backyards definitely doesnt get the recognition it deserves   IMO,?
364364,Ask for Dave  Freehand artist/ primarily  Great customer service as well  2 tattoos so far (different sessions) and both times I was satisfied with the shop environment  Good music (usually) and good work  Great job guys!,?
364554,Ask for Kelly Ive been going here for over a year and have just got my last haircut  since Im moving to another state in a couple of weeks  The haircut  other services (shampoo  conditioner  shoulder massage  etc )  and customer service were all amazing  I have also never had a problem with the reservations when I call ahead of time  but I think this is influenced a bit by the person you make a reservation with  I have ALWAYS had Kelly cut my hair  since she nailed it the first time and has been able to do the same each time after  She truly cares about the customer and weve always had a great chat every time I go in  If only theres a place like this where Ill be moving to!,?
365094,Asked for 3 men for 3 hrs  Got 2 men for 4 hrs  Ive moved a lot & never more than 3 hrs  Took them 7 hours! They took their time  They said the owner only pays them $10/hr & no gas money  (Even though I paid $25 trip fee!) Good try boys! The tip I had planned was stolen AND an extra $135! Denied me asking for 3 men  Took forever & should have hustled  To top it off  they took $300 cash from my dresser drawer  Furniture was crushed  gouges in sofa  antique table & chairs broken  my $5 000 bed frame had big scrapes $ the list goes on! See pics! If I could give ZERO stars I would!,?
365593,Asparagus  mushroom and Swiss cheese egg white on bagel was really good! Despite the 10 minutes wait ,?
366909,At bell auto they offer excellent quality cars for reasonable price   They have their own mechanical shop and they offer financing for both prime and nonprime deals on the spot   There is over 150 cars to choose from and they are all come with a free carproof history report   They have been in business for over 10 years and are a member of UCDA and BBB  Excellent customer service and professional staff ,?
368340,At first we werent so sure about this place but reviews on yelp convinced us to try it  Absolutely no regrets! Love the food!!  Great service!,?
368863,At least 4 stars   Wonderful food and environment   Staff was informative and attentive   Layout is fantastic with a lot of natural light ,?
368961,At least the people here are knowledgeable enough to work there  Went to the  one on nellis and they couldnt tell a faux gucci from a real one   They know authentics here    Plus the guy wasnt sure one bag had a high resell so he looked it up on ebsy saw he was wrong and went ahead and bought it ,?
370004,At the risk of sounding like a major shill for this place  we got takeout again tonight  and  again  it was great  They have an awesome dry rub called Caribbean Jerk that my wife and I love  As in our previous experiences the wings were cooked perfectly  We also tried their Southwest Spud Bitez (sic)  cheese and jalapeno filled potato bites  Now  my experiences with those types of apps at these types of restaurants have generally been somewhere between  meh and holycrapisthisactuallyfood? Well  I was shocked because these were perfectly made  nongreasy little puffs of whoopee   Yeah  we loved them  No  Im not suggesting Karen Small put them on her menu  but if they were served at the bar I doubt anyone would complain  So  Wing Warehouse  you have stolen my chickenwing heart  Keep up the great work ,?
370337,At this point in my life I have no desire to be right in the middle of the party  but still want to get to the party if so inclined  I also like an upscale  clean environment  The Signature delivers that  It has its own private gated entrance  no nightclubs or casino  but allows one to get there via a covered airconditioned walkway to the MGM Grand  or a quick walk to the strip  If you want to cab it the line is virtually nonexistent The rooms are large  well appointed and many have great views of the strip  The pool is clean and even when full  doesnt feel overcrowded  Theres a Starbucks and other cafes/restaurants on site The staff was very helpful and pleasant to deal with Theres no casino on the property  and there arent a bunch of drunks or barely clothed people running down the halls at 4am yelling/smoking/passing out/trying to get into the wrong room  Would definitely stay here again ,?
370577,Ate a late dinner there and had excellent enchiladas!  The rice and beans were very good too!  I loved that they had a happy hour starting at 9 pm with  delicious $5 margaritas   I will go back on my next visit to the Venetian ,?
370712,Ate at Elements restaurant last night   Service was outstanding   From the complimentary valet to our wait staff  every person we encountered was extremely friendly and helpful   We were celebrating our anniversary and everyone wished us a happy anniversary   The food was super yummy!Portions were large and the presentation was beautiful   Everything was seasoned and cooked to perfection   Great meal and one of the best high end restaurants we have been to in Phoenix   Also  the grounds and view are outstanding  must do at sunset ,?
371674,Ate here a couple of days ago and this restaurant was a great mom and pop Thai restaurant  They offer a free Thai tea if you check in and the tea was amazing  The food was really good and reasonably priced  The service was amazing  the hostess came by a couple of time and checked in on us  She even offered to have the food redone because it seemed like we were struggling with the spice which was very thoughtful  Youre not going to get anything fancy with the atmosphere but you shouldnt expect that with a small mom and pop place like this  Overall I recommend eating here  I know I will surely be back  I absolutely loved the Thai tea ,?
371694,Ate here a couple of weeks ago  And really enjoyed the concept  build your own taco   Also the taste was fantastic   Going back this week again ,?
371910,Ate here after a volleyball tournament  Wonderful pizza  Really likes the pepperoni  Staff extremely helpful and attentive ,?
372760,Ate here for the first time last night  Nice atmosphere  The dragon is an impressive work of art  They need to work on service though  Our server actually came off as grumpy  For the price we paid  a friendly server would have been nice  Food was just okay  Vegan options are a plus though ,?
373156,Ate here last night for a work function  Food was excellent  service was great  My wife and I enjoyed the experience  Restaurant is very nice inside  And we hope to be back again  just the 2 of us ,?
373620,Ate here on a Sunday night and was one of two tables at 6 PM  Take out business seemed very brisk  Service was very attentive  When my husband requested fried rice  the server actually suggested a combo platter which was cheaper than the way he was originally going to order  Orange chicken was good and certainly good value for the price charged  Would rate 3 5,?
374171,Ate here today! Loved it  The pad Thai is delicious  the duck is amazing and the sushi is wonderful!! The service is always fast and friendly  They put a lot of thought into the decor so its nice to eat inside or you can carry out  They have a full bar with good cocktails and a wine and beer list also  Love this little hidden gem!,?
375096,Ate lunch here today the food as always was amazing  However the service was horrible  As soon as we walked in the guy took us to our table and just left didnt say a word  There was only one other table when we were there and this guy seemed hurried he asked what we were drinking and started to leave in a hurry  He took our order and we asked if we could get the dimsum cart for an appetizer he just  said yeah yeah  The cart never came  the lady came out with the truck helped another table and went to the back  Our food came out super quick so that was nice  Finally i asked if i could have my pho to go and he asked all of it? I told him yes  When i got in the car and looked at my food half of it was missing   The server was a tall lanky man and in the end got helped by the manager half the time ,?
375102,Ate lunch here today  food was up to sonic s standards  It was VERY busy thought ,?
375360,Ate their 2x last week   The service is crazy slow and add in some who cares attitude from some lowrent servers   Reason for 2 visits is that we were staying at the resort   Ive eaten there many times over the years and it has gone done hill  way down hill   There was a time that you could not beat a casino coffee shop for value and quality   Neither exist here unfortunately   No excuse for soggy cold food especially when the restaurant is not busy   Why cant one item be brought out by itself?  Why must it be part of a huge tray?  Where is the food cooked  Detroit?,?
376408,Atmosphere and decore is fantastic  Lychee martini is five star and at 12$ its not supernovae priced  The beans are a must order The kimbucha soup was goodThe mushroom salad was below averageas well as our tofu rice noodle large dish   especially for 18$ I believe that there are better restaurants at Red rock ,?
376648,Atmosphere is awesome  service is excellent   The thai salad is my favorite   I order it almost daily on my way home! The peanut dressing is so good  I could drink it  I also love the drive up take out service   makes it so much easier!,?
376789,Atmosphere is good   Food is ok (lobster is a bit dry)   Price is reasonable   Service is good Overall it is ok  nothing to write home about   So I probably will not return ,?
377360,Atmosphere was excellent  The sushi rolls were good  The salmon I had was prepared not to my liking though  Had the texture of mashed potatoes  Its $16 a pound but prepared poorly  The service was way below average  Took forever for everything  Even to get a water took 15 minutes ,?
378049,Atmosphere: This place is by a bunch of businesses  so there are a lot of people that go here for lunch  It can get pretty busy! Service:The employees are friendly  There was only one day when they were a bit backed up  because they were down two employees  but they didnt seem too frantic Food & Drinks:The food tastes fresh  and I dont feel guilty after eating  Everything is healthy and delicious  I pretty much ordered the same thing on every visit  a turkey burger and soup  It was all delicious every time I ordered it  It was nice that I got great food every time  It was consistent  My coworkers were so much more healthier than me  The whole reason we went to this place was for their Kale Tonics  which is a refreshing beverage (if you like that kind of stuff)  Lol  Im not much of a kale person  but everyone else enjoyed it  They have a nice pick two for lunch with your two choices of soup  salad  or sandwich ,?
378590,Attended Citta twice in the past 2 weeks  Brunch was excellent! This place has an array of fresh pastries that are to die for! Omg the raspberry white chocolate bomboloni! (Italian donut with filling) sooo good! I just had dinner tonight and service was great  Good was great as usual  And the bartender (kind of long hair/totally cool guy) brought over complimentary shots for me and my friend! Always a good time here! Love it! Good job! As usual ,?
378734,Attended a birthday party on their outside patio  What a beautiful space! Only sampled appetizers  Didnt care for the mini crab cakes   but the meatballs a prime rib sandwiches were delicious  Definitely coming back for their happy hour!,?
378959,Attended a very large gathering upstairs  All of the food was very good and the service was constant and attentive ,?
379420,Attended with 6 work colleagues for lunch   While the food was acceptable the service for 6 at our table was slow   At the end of our meal when the bill was brought out we paid individually and the waitresses complained about the fact that there were too many coins (loonies and toonies and about 3dollars in quarters) definitely not more than 10 dollars total in change on a bill of approximately $90 00 before tip   They were quite rude about it   I would not return for the slow service and the very rude staff  Disappointing experience ,?
379527,Attention Charlotte RestaurantGoers  Pollos Mario is a hidden gem!The restaurant is Colombian  with some dishes from other Latin American countries   Colombian food is tasty  not heavy or spicy like Mexican food  but balanced   Their specialities include chargrilled meats  fried and sweet plantains  and fruit shakes (mango  pineapple  guava  etc)   One dinner  consisting of a meat  rice and beans  plantains and a side salad is less than $10!  The service is highquality; the wait staff and owners are friendly and attentive   The restaurant is clean   Restaurants on Albermarle Rd tend to carry the stigma of that side of town  but you wont be dissapointed If youre feeling adventurous  try the beef tongue or Postobon soda ,?
379976,Attentive staff  Great massage  Good price  Affordable quality  Had French manicure and pedicure  Then eyebrow threading  Gave a tip :) take the time to enjoy everything !,?
380026,Attila has helped me with countless projects big and small around my previous home since 2002 and moving into my new house last year  He does a fantastic work installing hardwood floor ceiling fans electrical work as well as any plumbing needs you may need  He is very knowledgeable and real reasonable as far as prices go  Always there on time and works very clean  Before I moved into my new house last year he painted the entire interior and in order to complete the job as promised he actually spent some of the nights at the house so he can work as late as possible and start as early as possible  I highly recommend Attila to Handyman for both interior or exterior work around your home Hes also great working around your pets in the house ,?
380166,Attractive enough facility but the food is average at best   We did an event for 60ish people and had the Salmon and Airline Chicken as choices   The entrees and sides were blah  unseasoned  and visually uninspiring    The salad and rolls were good   Dessert was odd; the chocolate base was good but the poached fruit on top was awful   The servers were polite but their timing was poor; they started serving prematurely during the opening comments and by the time they made it to the last table the first tables food was cold   I wasnt paying but I cant imagine there was value in what was received ,?
380964,Austin and Dennis came at 8 am to clean my ceramic tile  they could not have done a better job2 bathrooms a hall  a kitchen and a laundry room all look brand new you wont go wrong if you need carpet or tile cleaned,?
381691,Authentic Japanese restaurant with nice atmosphere  delicious food at decent prices  scorrrrrre! Ive been to neighbouring Japanese restos and I either find them to be cheap but non authentic or authentic but too expensive  Haru is authentic and fairly inexpensive!  I love rolls and they have a variety of unique rolls thats far from being traditional   I ordered the Rich roll and it was delicious!! Great flavour with the perfect amount of crunch and spiciness  Their rolls are fairly big and its not because its loaded with rice like others but rather filled with lots of ingredients like cucumber and crab  Hmmmmmm  Haru has just became my top 3 Japanese resto in the Richmond hill area ,?
382115,Authentic Pad Thai!  The jasmine sweet tea is great!  Highly recommended!,?
382202,Authentic Sushi  great service spectacular uni  Felt like we were sitting at a Japanese home talking to the chef really great prices were fantastic  did I say again with the service was really great? Best sushi I have ever had ,?
382521,Authentic and reasonably priced  Unlike other Mexican restaurants in the area  the food here does not taste like it has been dumped out of a can and warmed up in the microwave  We had given up on eating Mexican food out due to this trend  I am so glad we gave Viva Tequis a chance!,?
382848,Authentic indian snack foods  The paav bhaji is 2 lightly buttered and grilled paavs served with mass spicedmix vegetable with red curry  The paavs are literally buttered hamburger buns  The curry had a strong tomato flavor The panipuri was yummy but did not provide enough potato veggies to stuff in the puris Mango lassis are delicious! Overall  customer service was not the best  Felt unwelcome from the male owner  but his wife is a sweetheart!,?
383320,Authentic  great flavors  and amazing service  DDD TV segment inspired our first visit  Had mole burrito which did not disappoint  Wife had a specialty drink  much too sweet  Fresh salsa bar fresh with a variety of unique options  Will return for sure however not a Saturday evening   exceptionally loud ,?
383471,Authentica! This place is legit  California burrito was on point  The wait was worth it  Fun place to sit in the sun and enjoy during the winter months  Summer would want to be inside   but a good place to do a quick stop if youre hungry at the airport ,?
383777,Autumn has been doing my hair for over 10 years now and I refuse to go anywhere else! I moved to NYC last year and every time I come home to visit AZ  I visit Autumn as well  thats how much I love how she does my hair  Not only does she get my color right every time  she also styles it better than anyone else  I always get compliments on my color  style  cut etc and I owe it all to Autumn :) Im already looking forward to my next trip to AZ  just so I can see her!,?
384419,Average and overrated  Not to be chosen if your looking for a great culinary experience  Think upscale chain style restaurant  Lacks  personality or personal care  a business lacking soul  The decor is uninspired trendy and suburban ,?
384555,Average at best  Not a fan  I went for a business dinner thank goodness because the bill was 595 00 for 9 people and all I had was soup  Nothing on the menu appealed to me  The French onion soup was gross  Best part was the bread and goat cheese  I was not impressed and would never go again  I dont think there was one person who raved about anything  Too expensive for average ,?
385013,Average food at best  very slow service  forgot 1/3 items we ordered and had us waiting 510 minutes for them to set a table when we got there  What really bothered me tho was that basically every review mentioned that they give out free cookies at the end of the meal  We watched as they gave them to basically every other guest  None were given to us  we even waited around for like 5 minutes after the check to see if they would come but nope  nothing ,?
385103,Average food with an average menu,?
385702,Average place   Slow service   Not impressed with the food either    Not coming back ,?
387296,Avoid the taro milk tea  It is overly sweet  The apple fritter could use more apples  but it is nicely flavored ,?
387897,Avoid this place at all costs  I got violently ill from one of their cakes (rancid custard)  I sent three emails and called them to inform them  and request a refund for the rancid cake  They refused  and basically told me that it wasnt their fault  Poor customer service and rancid goods  Not a good combination  purchase at your own risk ,?
388230,Avoid this place  unless you are prepared to fight against their way to run this place  including charging more late fee than indicated in the contract and blame you for it Some room just dont have any heating  They do have an outlet  but no heating comes out  Their way to build the air conditioner system decided that  explained by their own staff  But they would not admit when you require them to provide you with better environment  Be prepared for the Illinois Winter then!The shuttle services may be shut down by any reason  it is so casual So  unless  you are prepared  avoid this place ,?
388243,Avoid this place     Service doesnt come with a smile if it comes at all   Food is ok but not worth the negative atmosphere shining off the staff ,?
388900,Awasome place  Very nice and helpfull stuff Food is very tasty  I will come back again for sure !!!!!!!),?
388912,Away from the main Strip  M Resort has become one of my favorite places to visit for the food  gambling and sport book  Its a great place to start or end a trip to Vegas  I look forward to all this place has to offer There are some great choices for food here from the Studio B buffet to burgers and brew to the quick VigDeli and Hash House A Go Go!!  yes!I come here not only for the food but the $510 gambling options and my friends love the sport book  A great location to play and not have to place crazy large bets  until you feel really lucky  Dealers here have been friendly and even a couple of the pit bosses  The cocktail servers are pleasantly great looking  Nice eye candy while the house takes your money  ;) Lounges are nice and chill I havent yet stayed in the rooms  but itll be one of the things Ill do in the future  My Studio B reviewhttp://www yelp com/biz/studiobbuffethenderson#hrid:mZjy5Gm83bOYM6ZxkXko3Q,?
389014,Aweful place   very dirty   the only attraction in the buffet for me was the crab legs and the pan was almost always empty    went there sunday night and it was a mess the carpet the floor very dirty  the dishes were wet which was disgusting and price is higher on the weekends! Overpriced ! Big time     never ever going back again !,?
389076,Aweful  The food tasted like it was microwaved which it probably was  The servers sucked they all standed around and talked while i need something for my meal  The hostess were rude  The food is not what it used to be they down graded 100%  Someone needs to shut them down before their food starts killing all the old folks that go in that place ,?
389681,Awesome Carne Asada tacos!! Really tasty  Nice charbroiled steak and fast and friendly service  Cant go wrong  Cant wait to try more ,?

390707,Awesome Ramen! We had the dinner combo that includes one appetizer  any ramen and a beer for $19 00  Red ramen broth is spicy  hot and creamy with just the right amount of pork and noodles  Potato croquettes were delicious and a beer to wash it down was the perfect little dinner  Although not so little  It was definitely filling  Id go back again any time!,?

The skinny younger valet guy is awesome ,?
402380,Awesome job  This place definitely takes pride in their work  Keith took his time with my wash/wax; about 2 hours on a 2 door hatchback and the price was amazing! I recommended him to all my European car friends  which I generally dont do because I know how picky people can be about their cars  but theres nothing they could possibly find wrong with Keiths work  My car literally hasnt looked this good since I bought it over 10 years ago  I will be calling on a regular basis from now on  I couldnt be happier with the way my car looks  Thanks!,?

403213,Awesome local hidden treasure!! Really small blink and youll miss it bar off the freeway  Small parking lot  but there is a lot of parking available near by  Inside is a cool tiki decor (they no longer have hand carved tiki chairs)  The hand crafted cocktail menu has several unique options with a rating scale of sculls to gage potency! I recommend the Wild Wattusi 5 skulls  one of the strongest drinks available  Really delicious drinks and all signature cocktails are generously portioned and only $10 really inexpensive for near strip location  Tip: because its such a small dive bar smoke can be pretty strong so be prepared to wash your clothes after you visit ,?
403215,Awesome local jewelry store  Had 6 rings resized and the work was fast and really good quality  Very fair priced  I would definitely recommend if you need any jewelry work  I was worried because the previous shop I was in was very shady  The people here were very nice and trustworthy ,?
403236,Awesome local restaurant!  I love coming here for weekend brunch   Great options and a mimosa or beer is included with the meal!  Huge patio space and probably the most dog friendly spot in the valley   (Probably not your go to if you dont like canines)They brew their own beer and make some spirits as well (horseradish vodka in the bloody mary was )   Go support you local neighborhood watering hole!,?
403279,Awesome location and Johnny was a saint        sadly the rest of the staff must have been in a horrible funk  DO NOT waste your hard earned money with these people  I sincerely hope my family reconsiders selling this property based on the attitude displayed during my business trip  UNBELIEVABLE!,?

408561,Awesome place  great service  and amazing food!!! Came to Las Vegas for a week long vacation back in August 2016 (Im so late) and this was our first food choice right off the plane  Came here about 3 times during the trip because it was so good! Had one server who was our favorite  Andy  and he gave us the best service! We loved the soju and he would even make it special for us with added lemon since they ran out of the peach we usually got  If you come here you HAVE to drink some soju!! We ate with a group of 8 and we didnt have to wait too long to be seated although the place was packed each night  maybe about 25 minutes at most  but worth every minute  My favorite food choices were the egg that comes around the BBQ grill and the pork belly  Everything else on the BBQ menu was also delicious! We left in a very happy food coma! If I ever get to come back to Las Vegas I will definitely be coming here first!,?

409206,Awesome place  Its very nice small  loving environment  The waiter Lisa is amazing she is so kind  The customer service alone gets them 5 stars  Very clean  They have a chicken and waffle selection on the menu but I wanted French toast  I was able to substitute it out so I am happier than ever   the food did not take very long to take which was amazing because I was starving when I came in   it was delicious very well season  I would totally eat here again ,?

412350,Awesome service  Yummy food  Amazing live entertainment before movies  Family atmosphere  We love this drivein and hope it stays around a long time  If you go  please consider purchasing food from the concession  Not only is it so good  but its how they make their money  Yes  its overpriced and youd do better bringing in your own food  but where will you bring your food to if they shut down?,?

415583,Awesome vet! Cared so much for our little Magnolia  Because of her size under 4lbs the Dr wanted to split up her shots because she was too small to take all 4!!

416057,Awesome worship and bible study  friendly staff and volunteers  and encouraging hope to the ppl ,?
416180,Awesome!  And LATE LATE LATE!SITREPHot Dam!  What a find when wandering along Las Vegas Blvd at 2am!  MENULV Yelper Paolo had recommended the Butter Chicken  Naan  Rice  ALL GOOD  and this particular dish tends to be my litmus test for different places from Seattle to Sacramento to L A  and now Vegas  and I have to say it was DeLISH PRICE YIKES!But the combo was about $14 after tax and tip  with this and something that I would consider to be very pricey if at home or work   However  this was my Vegas trip and in most situations while traveling  I wont spare the expense for the experience THE LOWDOWNA great find in Vegas for Indian fare!,?
416183,Awesome!  Awesome!  Awesome!  Kelly was very friendly and even more attractive in person   Rick and Tyler were both on site working and Rick walked right up to the group tour and started talking to Kelly  My kids and I loved it   It would have been nicer if he would have said hello or even just waved to us but instead he ignored us and went on with his business   I understand he has to work   We saw some of the restored items and their workshop   I didnt realize Kelly had a daughter who worked there too   We bought some very reasonably priced souvenirs and enjoyed our visit very much ,?
416607,Awesome! Fast seating  nice atmosphere  friendly staff  wonerful food selection  and everything was good  The curry vegie was one of my favorite  prime rib was just pure joy  My only regret was I didnt save enoug room for dessert  Had Bellagio buffet the night before and there is no comparison  stay away from Bellagio  its way overrated ,?
416884,Awesome! If you want a nobs quick fix for a stiff back this is the place to go! Chiropractor was very knowledgeable  She evaluated my problems and treated them promptly  Cheaper than my insurance  Only gave minus a star because I waited for about 45 mins ,?

418658,Awesome  Display was well organized and they had tons of options  The woman that helped me was very informative and friendly  Will definitely make this my goto shop ,?
419591,Awful business! After a once over of my dog they said she might have parvo  They vet & tech left came back then took my pup out of office to be weighed  If she was a possible parvo she shouldnt have aloud to possibly come in contact with dogs?  Then they leave again  Vet tech comes back by herself with $600 bill  $300 was for medications  When I asked what was wrong they said could be this    could be that     well try all theses meds & see if she gets better  They wanted to try 6 drugs to help?? But werent sure what was wrong  $100 for dog benedryl?  Its was so sad they wanted to give her antihistamine  ant acids  anti vomit  anti diarial  & antibiotics  she would have an immune system shut down! They wouldnt talk about natural helpers or never asked what  we feed her? It was all push dtugs get $! Very dishonest & greedy  My dogs not an experiment? Dont go here! Research what drugs they want to give you & why before agreeing to pay $75 for tums!,?
419966,Awful experience I have never been so insulted by a place of business  I took my Gary fisher in because the bolt that holds the handlebars broke  when I told the guy at the counter he laughed in my face and said I dont sell stuff like that  I asked if he knew where I could find the bolt and he once again laughed in my face and said home depot is the only place I know that has standard bolts  There should be a sign on the door that says hipsters only because if you dont look the part you get treated like an idiot  Since visiting this place I have been to many other shops that are willing to point you in the right direction if they cant help you themselves ,?
420169,Awful experience  35 minute wait after order  Food served stone cold  No adjustment to bill  Highly unrecommended Returned for a second chance  Identical experience  In fact  they took the food to the kitchen for one minute and brought it back cold again  Two servers in the entire restaurant  which is packed  Nothing like other Firkins Ive been to  which are usually quite good  What a garbage place ,?
420297,Awful food   bad experience   veg pakora were burnt and not cooked    then the manager did not want to credit   ,?
420374,Awful food   Extremely overpriced  Just make your own pasta at home   Not worth the money  Service was painfully  slow  Never again,?
420744,Awful service (lack of any service) and little selection   See below for details Ive visited this store a couple of times only because I was returning products my roommate bought   The most recent time I decided Id do shopping and purchase an extended shower head arm   After searching for a while to find anyone to assist me  the young man I flagged down had no idea what I needed   He finally said he would contact someone in plumbing because he had only been at that location a few days   The young man spent over 15 minutes calling the person   Finally I asked for a manager   I walked up to them  told them how I had been waiting  sat the products down on her counter and saidIm going to Lowes ,?
421004,Awful service  my friend and I came here during a not so busy dinner service and it took ages for our orders to come out In fact  we had to constantly reorder and remind them while our soup was boiling away  Even when they brought our order  it was missing tons of stuff Will never visit again ,?
421072,Awful service   Food for our group came out at different times   Drinks took forever to get   Would not go back ,?
421130,Awful service  Dont go here unless you want to leave extremely unhappy  Avoid! Avoid ,?
421425,Awful!  I should have realized when I walked past a table with 2 Dogs with only 1 bite in them ,?
421702,Awful!!! I remember when Cicis used to be a great place to eat at  But boy it has gone down hill  Food out of a dumpster would have been better  Oh and customer service absolutely sucked! Who ever owns this place should be ashamed!,?
422583,Awful  This place has truly hit rock bottom  Growing up I use to live and breathe this place  now Im lucky if I dont go there by accident forgetting how garbage it is  Ordered the pizza  crust was extremely thin and crunchy  almost no cheese  Also got the small poutine  container was filled 60% of the way  the gravy was like water and the fries were so soggy I thought I was going to explode  My brother got a salad  with no dressing  and another order of soggy fries  All in all a terrible experience  And I will (hopefully) never order from this place ever again ,?
424296,BAD ILLEGAL CLUB!!!!!! THEY BREAK THE LAW!!! SHOULD BE CLOSED DOWN!!!One night I saw a child allowed into the club  He appeared to be 12 years old  and he was smoking with adults   The child was also allowed to get a lap dance  Another night I saw a bouncer assault a female customer  and the manager didnt do anything   The woman was beaten up badly  and this illegal assault should have been reported to police Also the djs are terrible and they play too much black music ,?
424328,BAD SERVICE  I was standing in the mall walkway which is close to their bar trying to decide if my family and I should eat there (total of 10 adults and 3 kids (picky eaters))  While I was waiting for my Uncle to come back from the parking garage I was watching their tv screens they had at the bar when this lady with red hair asked me if I wanted to order anything to drink or eat  I told her no  not right now because I am just waiting  She said I am going to have to ask you to sit on the bench she said I couldnt watch their TVs if I wasnt going to order  (The bench was in the middle of the walkway)  As soon as my Uncle came back  we took our business elsewhere  There are so many other restaurants   why waste time and money on one with rude staff ,?
424979,BBQ sandwich and french fries were great  The tea was just good  Service was very friendly  Will return  possibly for the ribs ,?
425449,BEAUTIFUL!!!! Next time I come back to Phoenix  Im staying here! We stayed in a 2 BR condo that was huge  It had its own kitchen  living room  dining table  patio  2 separate bathrooms  a washer and dryer   I can go on and on   Their facilities were also very good  Best gym Ive seen at a hotel/condo  They also had a kids and teen room and much more  Everything was clean and new  We like it so much that we are going to look at the models of their condos that they have for sale ,?
426155,BEST CLUB IN VEGASI came here on two occasions 6/4 on a Friday night to watch Big Sean and 8/6 on a Saturday night to watch Trey Songz  Both times Ive been here have been crazy! Getting in was a breeze especially when you get bottle service  which I did for both nights  Once you get in  the venue is jaw dropping  Our promoter Brian hooked my group up every time  On 6/4 he got my group a table closer to the dance floor (even though we booked a farther table)  It gets crazy when artists perform and sometimes people will end up blocking your view but it doesnt change the fact that I was listening to big Sean live! On 8/6 we got a mezzanine table and the view was the best! Overlooking the entire venue and it was perfect for watching Trey songz  Long story short  go to drais! Best venue and top artists every weekend! If you need someone to set your group up  hit up Brian 1 (773) 4598133 he can take care of all your Vegas needs and definitely not disappoint!,?
426599,BEST HOT DOGS IN TOWN    HANDS DOWN!!! Especially if you like them Carolina style or all the way   chili  mustard  onions  slaw   the ONLY way a dog should be!! Beef dogs have great flavor and toppings are very tasty as well   everything has flavor   nothing is bland as many other dogs in town are   Dogs are also grilled  not boiled whichnis soooo much better tasting  Fries are also great too   light seasoning salt   yum!!resaonable prices too  we were gonna go to a place where the dog plain was $4 49 then 50cents each for onions and slaw  plus $1 00 for chilli!!! Thats RiDicULos!!! Here at Noda  you get a 2 dog combo anyway you like it with fries for $6 00!! Have to buy your drink from the store  which is no biggie because you have to go over there to pay plus you have thousands of drink choices     from sodas  water  beer  wine!!!!,?
426754,BEST LAMB SOUVLAKI IVE EVER HAD  And Greek/Mediterranean food is my favorite  so Ive had A LOT of it  This place is hands down the best in the city  Grilled octopus  thin fried zucchini  saganaki  baklava    all mouthgasms ,?

429249,BEWARE when you sign a lease  even an extended lease  you have to give the management a 30 day notice before your lease end date that you actually want your lease to end (even though you sign a contract with a specific end date) or you get charged another full month of rent  Management not willing to work with you even if you were an excellent resident for several years  For this lack of customer service  I Do NOT recommend San Marbeya ,?
429356,BEWARE! BAIT AND SWITCH after booking through priceline  Pre paid at 15 a day via priceline  after getting there and dealing with a remote video chat  the agent says we dont have any economy cars  so we will get you a nissan ummm ok? Why do I care  I paid already  month in advance  so they had time to have a car ready  I dont know if Nissan is not an economy car or not  After my 5 day trip  the agent whom checked my car back in asked if I enjoyed my upgraded car  puzzled  I said what do you mean  and she stated I paid 120 extra for the car  I stormed up to the desk  demanded a manager who conviently wasnt available  left my information  and I had to contact them 3 weeks later  Now Im 5 days since our initial email  Unbelievable  Im not going down without a fight  Hertz will hear about this one way or another ,?
429473,BEWARE! These people are scammers! They told me that theyre were a handful of things wrong with my car  When I went to a different auto shop for a second opinion they literally laughed and told me there was absolutely nothing wrong with my car  I thought it was odd every time I went in for an oil change they always came back and said there was something else that needed to be fixed  When in reality  they were just trying to take advantage of someone who doesnt know much about cars  DO NOT GO HERE!,?
429563,BEWARE!! 5 DAY RETURN POLICY! Yes  FIVE  That no one (owner or employee) will tell you about until you try to return something after 5 days  of course (because a standard return policy is 30 days)  And they will point to the miniature exchange sign that is placed on the counter  along side another sign that has nothing to do with the business  and say that is the policy and thats where its posted for customers to see it  I was shocked at such an absurd  terrible  highly inconvenient policy when I tried to return a sweater because when I purchased it not a single person  who works at or owns the store  offered even an Are you familiar with our return policy? Or a Just so you know   Aubrey apologized yet did nothing to truly rectify the situation  This store is quite cute  albeit out of the way (also hugely inconvenient for customers/returns); unfortunately the policy and customer service  or lack thereof  is highly disappointing ,?
430833,BLAHvery expensive to stay herethis hotel has NO theme  not that nice  i did like it though it is clean and smells like vanilla when you walk in but i mean its such an average hotel  prefer Bellagio or Vdara for that matterthe hotel rooms are nice  dont get me wrong  but im connecting the price with the rooms and hotel  not worth it in my opinion  unless you can get a killer deal  go elsewhere,?
431635,BOTTOM LINE: VISIT ON MONDAY MORNING Came here for my free coffee on Monday and used the drive thru  The man who took my order was very nice and indulged my questions  The girl at the window was also very nice and efficient Now  its just a few days later and I decided to indulge in a breakfast sandwich and hash browns  This visit was very different from my first visit  The girl who took my order seemed a little preoccupied but finally got my order right  The girl at the window had a dont bother me look on her face  barely said 2 words to me  didnt appear to count how much money I gave her and did not tell me how much money I owed  Good thing the little outdoor display screen worked  Otherwise  we would both have just sat their staring at each other My thought is the folks staffed toy did NOT have their coffee yet  I will stick with Mondays from now on ,?
432299,BUYER BE WARE!!!! I bought a $70 ring that gave me a green thumb an hour later I am not from Arizona & the lady clearly saw that I was a tourist & took advantage of me  If I were local  i would probably attempt to report them to every consumer group possible ,?
432983,BYRON IS THE BEST ! We had a great time and were thoroughly entertained by his charisma and outgoing personality!,?
433499,Bacchanal buffet and wicked spoon are a must stop in Vegas! Delicious food with great presentation!!,?
435012,Back in the 90s I used to think this place was great   I moved away and when I moved back in 2014 I wanted to go to Milanos   I told my BF what great food they had   I was totally disappointed   I agree with the others about it tasting like Chef Boyardee   I even mentioned it when we were eating   I began thinking that maybe it was just that night  so   I went back and was disappointed again   Cross this place off my list of favorites ,?
435492,Back up the ladder and a nod to the free Big BBQ sandwich ($6 value) offer available through the email club  Went back to pretty much what this place is known for I think  the brisket  You can get it served two ways and I chose chopped this time  Served plain with a few pickles on a white bun  the meat was pretty much perfect  no fat  nothing  The sauces contain alot of artificial ingredients  lately an issue for me  and all three sauces kind of taste similar  You only need a dab if you choose the brisket  Too bad the other meats are not up to brisket quality  but now at least I wont wait til my birthday week to return again ,?
436196,Bad Daddys Burger Bar is AWESOME!!  Great atmosphere and totally yummy food   Highly recommend the Sam I Am burger paired with the straw onion rings    The banana pudding is insanely addictive   Burgers are a little pricey but well worth every cent!!,?
437592,Bad experience  Wont ever go back to this location 1) The hostess seats us and all she says to us is let me know if you have any concerns    I automatically said should I be concerned? jokingly  She didnt say anything and walked away  I mean who says that when your first seating customers to eat? Red Flag!!2) Our waitress only came to our table once to get our drink order/food order  Whats the point of offering bottomless fries if you cant order more? She wasnt anywhere is sight to even call her over 3) Bathroom was dirty and hadnt been cleaned in a while with trash all over the floor  also no toilet paper at all ,?
437609,Bad experiences at places like Ryans kept me from trying Showmars  But I finally gave in because I found out they serve gyros   And I hadnt had a gyro since leaving Chicago many moons ago   To my surprise Showmars gyros are really good!  Not gourmet or authentic by any means   Lets just say most Greek restaurants dont griddle their pitas in butter   But its cheap  fast  quality diner food  Definitely greasy and if you order too many sides or dessert theyll have to roll you out on a gurney   But for what it is  Im a fan   The crowd is pretty hip too ,?
438942,Bad service  steak not cooked to order and Caesar salad was not good either  Only thing  was lobster was decent  Couldnt even get a refill on water! Wont go back!,?
439402,Bad stay for my honeymoon the hallway smelled like weed and the smell eventually went into my room  I called security 3 times for two days straight and they never did anything to solve the problem i will just stay elsewhere on my next trip in october,?
439419,Bad sushi  do not try the coconut nigori  its not that good  Everything is overpriced for the poor quality fish  Avoid this place  or just order the Kung Pao Chicken  You can never go wrong with that  But at this price  youd be better off at Panda Express ,?
440154,Bagels here are pretty good  Soft yet crunchy but 4 stars bc a small everything with vegetable creamcheese turned out to $4! A little over priced but the person that made my bagel was very generous with the creamcheese  I would def come back!,?
440448,Bailie is AMAZING! Shes the only one I see anymore! She listens to everything you ask for & really pays attention to every detail  I fall more in love with my lashes every time she does them   Had to update my review because the retention rate of these lashes  sucks! Ive been seeing them for about a year now & the reason I only see bailie is because shes the only one whos work lasts longer than a week  until this last time  Its only been a week & Ive already lost over 80% of my lashes  It sucks because their lash artists work always looks so amazing but they never last!,?
440612,Bait and switch  Advertised a 6x10 cargo trailer for $1 821 00 on their website  Told me they are $2 100 00 and that was a mistake and could not sell it for that price  Take your business to a better  more honest company!!!,?
441733,Bang Bang Burgers is SO yummy! I love that its so close to our house in Elizabeth  The burger bowl is delicious  really everything is! We have been here at least a dozen times and they never disappoint!,?
441825,Bang for the buck!Went there on my birthday  we ordered a Full Rack of Ribs and  Wings  What really stands out is their serving size  wings that are actually not tiny and magnanimous beef rack ribs!Not to say that the size took anything from the taste  All of that for a really reasonable price 10/10 would go again ,?
441868,Bang was my first salon experience and it was great  Nicole gave me a cut and color  Im very happy with it and will definitely be a regular customer of hers  Thanks  Nicole!,?
441927,Banging guacamole! Great service  good prices especially for their lunch special   Rice was good too  not dried out like other places   :) their carne Asada tacos are legit tasty   New Yorker here in Arizona for the first time and I am impressed ,?
442409,Bar 32 is a hidden gem! I enjoyed viewing Cleveland and watching the sunset  The weather was perfect  72 degrees  The drinks were a little pricy  two bud light drafts came to $20  The atmosphere was great and upscale  I would not suggest wearing casual clothes  You should dress to impress ,?
442467,Bar Code is the BEST! From the food to the friendly servers  everything is first class! The DEGENERATE BURGER is one not to be missed  and the DEVYN SALAD is simple yet scrumptious  The beer and cocktail prices are really reasonable especially for a bar so close to the Las Vegas Strip! Totally worth the trip  Id recommend it over and over again!,?
442603,Bar ReviewThe cosmopolitans are really tasty and a great portion   My favorite item was the tuna tacos  This is a good happy hour overall but the atmosphere here is odd    not too happy  The servers were excellent and the happy hour items are unbeatable  Order anything you want but do not order mojitos  they are bad    really bad  Manhattan and Cosmopolitan are too good! I cannot wait to try their late happy hour soon ,?
442827,Bar is much better than the restaurant part  Because the place is very loud  So if you are there for drink and finger food it is ok but for eating i think it was a little too loud  Food is good but pricy ,?
443244,Bar/lounge is beautiful  Unfortunately my husband and I were not impressed with their drinks  We went to Fizz (Caesars) and Parasol up parasol down (wynn) during the same trip and really enjoyed what we had at those places  The waitress was nice and attentive and we also had fun people watching so I would give this place another chance  Maybe we just ordered the wrong things ,?
443379,Barbara and Edit have amazing skills  I have had chest waxing and facials by both  The waxing has been have been absolutely great and painless  The facials are very relaxing  Both are friendly  funny  and are a pleasure to interact with  Easy to book either over the phone or via their website  I have bought a few gift certificates for friends and family and they all have nothing but great things to say about how professional and friendly they both are  I would recommend them to anyone ,?
443543,Barber was rude  probably had a rough day  but did a decent job cutting my hair  They only take cash which is a bummer but the place is fairly nice ,?
443852,Barf  Vomit  Puke  Yes im describing the food and what i had to do after eating here  Do I need to say more?,?
444826,Bartender has been talking to employees and giving them all espressos and Ive been here 5mins without her asking if we wanted a drink    (We are and have been the only customers here)Now shes sitting at a table stuffing her face  All we have had is water brought  Really? Ok she brought our pizza  asked if we needed Parmesan  And left  Done with pizza and only got water whole time  Whats with Pittsburgh and pizza soup tho  Pizza was so runny it slid off into my lap  This is very similar to nearby stone but crust was way better there  And they have no staff (just a cashier) and I was still offered a beer  And the pizza was half the price there ,?
445707,Based on a suggestion we tried White Chocolate  From a meal cuisine standpoint its 4 stars but from a value standpoint its 5 stars  We had the Atlantic Salmon  Layered Chicken Enchiladas and the Tomato Gin Soup  The soup was wonderful   5 stars!  The salmon was very good but not special enough for 5 stars  The enchiladas were very good and quite a large portion  Im a big guy and couldnt finish it  The nice thing is that the prices are very reasonable for a nice restaurant  will good atmosphere in Scottsdale which is why I say from a value standpoint its 5 stars  We paid $53 for two and that included a glass of wine  Highly recommend when in Scottsdale ,?
446436,Based on the fact that I had my wedding reception here  my review could be a little biased but being an extremely picky customer I walked into the restaurant expecting to give it a four star rating and walked out with a five  The service was fantastic! what an amazing group of staff ! Spectacular view   probably one of the best in downtown TO  Finally but not the least  simple  quality food with an amazing wine list and an excellent bar! A great place to hold functions or even reward yourself with a quick drink at the bar on a Friday afternoon!,?
447992,Basically  everything is great  I loved eating sichuan baked fish in China so I was super thrilled to see a restaurant serving it here in Canada for the first time Food 5/5Just like China  Flavors are rich and powerful  I love spicy food  especially when its ACTUALLY as spicy as advertised  The food here doesnt disappoint  (They also have nonspicy options )Service 5/5The service is terrific  I dont usually expect much service at Chinese restaurants in the west but this place definitely sets the bar high  One of the girls that works here (full time I assume since shes always here when I come to eat) is super nice and accommodating Cleanliness 5/5No complaints They also take WeChat pay and Alipay ,?
449370,Be aware  this grouchy old guy will tell you he will buy your records and for you to bring them to him  Then after you load up boxes of heavy records with the promise that he will make you an offer  he flips through them so fast he barely looks at them  Then he cherry picks one or two if your lucky and tells you to take the rest to good will  A old time bait and switch  Dont waste your time  Unfortunately he is the only game in town and he knows it For those people who post they like this place its because they are buyers of records not sellers  So you can believe what you read ,?
449637,Be careful people  whit medicare o medicaid this place is a scam this business is NOT CONTRACTED by medicare  they make fill you prescription there but they never get it pay by medicare so after all you loose time the preteen to make you pay cash and This is scam      I I ready report this business to the authorities in las Vegas and medicare      Also this place  make the prescription shoes inserts in  the house of the employee they dont have any skills for factory any of the inserts or orthopedics be careful  dont  let this peoples continues robbery people whit disability a,?
451016,Be sure to have your invite ready to show the guard at the gate or hes not gonna let you in  Itd be good to know your license plate number as well since hes gonna ask you  Show your invite and proof of working at your company and youre in to roam around  Ive recently discovered that I fit into kids size shoes  Benefits include cheaper prices and one less tax haha  The prices for shoes are pretty good but the discount on the clothing doesnt seem to be as good ,?
451474,Be warned!!!  When you cancel your service they will bill you until the end of the month no matter what!!! My Mom was using republic services for trash and I recently took over paying her bills  The cost was ridiculous  well over $80 00 for three months so I called Republic to cancel the service  They asked why I wanted to cancel  I stated because it was so expensive  The person stated that maybe it was because she was the only pickup in the area and that was why it was so expensive  Mom is on a fixed income so the why doesnt really matter  She said we will have to bill you to the end of the month  I said Mom isnt going to pay that because she isnt going to use your services until the end of the month  She said its our company policy  I asked to speak to her supervisor  She stated that the hold time was a long time and I did not have time as I was at lunch during work ,?
451819,Bear did my nails  and they look great  He got a bit close to the skin while doing the cuticle and cut my skin  Its a very clean shop  they offered me a drink  Would have given a higher mark had the cut not happened ,?
451822,Bear in mind that THIS La Cave is the one in the Paris  and is NOT the restaurant in the Wynn   There are still some conflicting reviews and pics in here  but dont be fooled   Try the other listing   Also  the pics are still incorrect on here   You got it!  For the other place That said  I love this little shop   And if you like wine  how could you not?  Lots of cookbooks  wine books  wine art  plates and trinkets   If you want to have nice things for wine events in your own home  this place works like a charm And while I havent tried all of their little foods  cheeses and chocolates  I have tried their pate   And I LOVE their pate The whole setting is charming  and fits in with the French exterior outside   It just looks like a quaint little shop nestled in the middle of a Parisian neighborhood  and its a nice effect If you like wine  not just the drinking it  but the art and culture behind it  this is a great place to visit ,?
452004,Beat the Las Vegas heat and step in for an iced coffee or smoothie!,?
452519,Beautiful Park that was designed by the same landscape architect who designed Central Park in NYC and Stanley Park in Vancouver,?
452679,Beautiful ambiance  and very accommodating despite of us being late for our reservation  great food and Tyler our server fabulous!,?
452761,Beautiful and artful  I love this new concept which make me feel more elevated  I sat at the bar near by an entrance  Their shrimp and grits was great and lucky enough I was there on $5 wine day  Many servers were on the floor during the time I was there  I noticed all servers were just stuck together chatting about their personal life instead of spreading out or checking up on their guests  Sadly to see this beautiful bar is lacking of services  My second glass of wine was not pour from the bottle but popped out from under the counter  I realized that since I sat at the bar    I saw a waitress brought back a glass of wine from their dining area  Maybe someone didnt like the Chardonnay?,?
452812,Beautiful and delicious gelato but it may a substantial wait time if theres a line in front of you  But if youve got the time then I recommend dropping by Right near The Linq so its a nice area to head for dinner and drinks then here for dessert  They also serve coffees and teas One can order a small  medium or large rose  Choice of up to 3 flavors for the small  I had the small and it was more than enough ,?
452924,Beautiful and spacious studio! We got a great deal otherwise it can be pretty pricey!,?
452934,Beautiful and tasty Italian food  Special staff that makes great not on the menu recommendations  Feels like having a meal with family! Homemade taste  If youre downtown  stop in very welcoming!,?
453846,Beautiful decor and ambience and service staff were attentive but flavour was lacking  meats were generally overcooked in my opinion  beef selection was small and I did not enjoy the chicken  Pineapple and cheese bread were my favorite things were  Hostess quoted the wrong price for dinner at reservation ,?
454369,Beautiful food and restaurant  they give ya food for days and days!I got the deelish risotto (they have multiple risottos) the service was great too ,?
454847,Beautiful hotel! The best in Vegas (from what I have stayed in)  The rooms make you feel like royalty  And the location is perfect  The venetian has all the best restaurants  bars  shops  EVERYTHING  I could probably just come to Vegas and spend a whole weekend just at the Venetian  The rooms are a bit expensive  but trust me  they wont disappoint  The pool is also very nice ,?
455953,Beautiful outdoor mall but dont try to use the restroom   Our first visit was yesterday   We decided to have lunch at RIce Republic   We asked the waiter where the restroom was located   He told us theres NO restroom in the restaurant   You have to use the one outside thats located in between the stores   To make a long story short    we had to go to 3 different restrooms at 3 different locations before we found one thats availabe   Apparently every restroom they have it only has ONE stall ,?
456422,Beautiful place with great amenities  great location  fair price and great management and maintenance ,?
457556,Beautiful salon and great location! I cant rave enough about KC! He is amazing  Every single treatment he has ever done to my hair has come out perfect  from color to cuts to Brazilian blowouts  Best hairdresser I have ever had!,?
457960,Beautiful sidewalk seating but awful friesnot crispy with a hint of mint! The mint didnt bother me  It was the soggy noncrisp fries  You can judge a lot on a basic side  If you mess this one up  theres no need to try anything else  Way too dark and dreary on the inside   Waitress Samantha was a doll!,?
458860,Beautiful views from patio but had to wait an inordinate time to be served cocktails after having been seated in restaurant  Wait staff seem confused as to which tables were in their section as we had 3 different servers  General manager was extremely nice and apologized for our delay in being served and said there was no excuse for this  Definitely need more help in bar area and waitstaff training  Food was good however  Id wait on trying this place again until theyve had more time to get things in better shape  Other friends of mine were also there and complained about slow service ,?
460071,Because I had a friend from Wisconsin coming in  I decided to look for a restaurant that I had never been and ended up choosing Javinos   I really didnt know what to expect and was pleasantly surprised    We both loved the atmosphere and the food    I felt like we were dining at a highend restaurant but without the highend price   The service was also great This is definitely a MUST COME BACK TO place ,?
461659,Beef soup is the way to go  Be prepared to wait for a table  but usually worth it  Table turn over is fast so you cant really linger if theyre busy  The food is really great  especially for the price ,?
461720,Beef chicken bowl and katana roll!!! Food looks and taste bomb!!!The staff are amazing always smiling!!Take bowls home for later   ,?
461765,Been 20 years    Looked the exact same Old dive bar  There is an odour that greets you upon entering  Id try to eliminate that  will turn off more than a few    Be nice if prices a bit lower ,?
462515,Been a member of LVAC for years   First started going to the 215/Flamingo and loved it   Moved to Henderson and went to the one on 215/Eastern as well as the one on 95/Flamingo and loved it  They were always great with my daughter   Just recently moved to Centennial Hills and was relieved when they opened this one   It looks great on the inside and everythings so new  But thats it   Ive never had a problem getting my daughter into the playroom until I came to this gym   A reservation? I would go on any day to the eastern or 95/flamingo location at 56pm and never needed a reservation? Am i going to a 5 star restaurant on the Strip?  You sure have enough property to make room for the stupid yogurt place and the overpriced nutrition store   Make room for the kids! And the staff in the playroom are the most unemotional  robotic people Ive ever seen   They never smile and are more like guards at post than playroom attendants  This place is ridiculous!,?
462545,Been a member since this club opened in 08   Spacious  with many different options to have an excellent and diverse workout   No gym really compares on this level  including The Village at more than twice the cost This would be an easy five stars if it werent for:1) their cancellation policy  my friends have had to jump through hoops and/or pay a personal visit to have their memberships stopped   If you can sign up over the phone  why cant you cancel a membership over the phone and email?  And 2) it is very crowded during peak times   On the flip side  this just means the price is right   To those who complain about the price tag  think how crowded it would be at HALF the price?Thank goodness they are open 24/7   If you are serious about getting a great workout: best to go late at night or middle of day ,?
462600,Been a patron for years and we went for our annual cheeseburgers which have always been one of the best in Scottsdale until now  Apparently  the new owner decided to redo it and very disappointed  Lettuce and tomato ice cold  strong hickory barbecue sauce added and then they cut it into 4 pieces and served like a club sandwich  I have no idea why  Burger was cold and growing colder   Impossible to eat and falling apart in addition to the chewy bun  They did remake them and comped our food which was greatly appreciated and the service and attention were excellent  Cole slaw was outstanding as well  The burgers were cooked to perfection but know to request uncut  etc ,?
462909,Been around different steak restaurants in Vegas  though a lot of good ones  Capital is always my go to   The steaks are cooked perfectly  and the service and ambiance are among the best in NV   The side dishes are like the rest  but their seafood app is the best!,?
463299,Been buying from this place for years  ONLY place in Phoenix for many of the varieties of rare tropical fruit available anywhere in Arizona  Good selection  decent prices  No they arent home depot low but these arent everyday plants  Good value  Owner is helpful and patient with questions  Completely non pushy  True they dont take credit cards and its located in the backyard    but when a place offers such killer otherwise unavailable plants that they do  who cares? If you are a true rare tropical fruit enthusiast than you will love Shamus!,?
463369,Been coming for 8 years and last time i came they have lost over $200 worth of shirts  They had no record of the receipt but im glad i kept mine ,?
463514,Been coming here every once in awhile since highschool  Place isnt too big and tends to be really packed during lunch hours since theres a school nearby and when dinner comes theres usually no seats  Food is great  I usually go with the chicken souvlaki special or the half chicken special  They take cash only! no credit/debit so make sure you stop at the bank or atm beforehand,?
463726,Been coming here for a couple of years and have yet to be disappointed  Consistent quality  great service and their food is made with love  I recommend the lo mein but ask for thin/skinny noodles  Incredible sauce/marinade ,?
464376,Been coming here for several months and its been a great experience  The shop is quiet and very peaceful  Many clients have been with Heather a very long time and why? Because she does awesome work! I never feel like they are rushed when I come in and I enjoy that immensely  Great new technique just introduced in the shop and I caved and went for it  So glad I did! Thank you Sachi Nails!,?
465164,Been coming here occasionally for a few years   Always found the free breakfast to be great and the service decent   Went here today for football Sunday and it was so hot inside and the smell was bad   In the womens room it was horrible   Service was at a crawl   just like the cockroach we saw on the bar!  We instantly tabbed after seeing that and having only one drink   well   tried to since it took at least 15 minutes to get service   Place has really gone downhill and based on other reviews it looks like they have a bad roach problem ,?
465816,Been coming to Ninos since late 80s  A big fan!Love the pizza  wings are the best and I lpve their chicken Parm sub My only complaint is they open too late ,?
465943,Been coming to the Tims since I was 10  their coffee in all that time has always been very inconsistent  More so in the past 8 years  The Tims down the road near the car dealerships (woodchester) always has great coffee Service tends to be pretty good  a few staff have been here for the past 14 years and theyre always amazing and super nice The new Mexican soup that offers chicken has little to no chicken Generally theyre quite friendly  its also relatively clean as are the bathrooms ,?
466098,Been coming to this place for a few years  the food has always been hot and fresh tasting  and always ready when I come to pick it up  not always the friendliest customer service but I dont care best Chinese food in town and you can always see in the kitchen ,?
466590,Been eating at this restaurant my whole life  and I have always loved it   The food hasnt changed in 25 years   Jade red chicken is obviously a favorite here   The cuban black beans and jerk fried rice are the two perfect sides to go with   You can order any of the meats here inside a burrito or quesadilla too  for some variety :D,?
468234,Been going here since 2005   Usually I get slices of pizza with spinach and tomatoes (around $8 50)   Back in the days  Guss had thick breadlike crust before which I really liked   About 3 years ago  they made their crust a lot thinner   The thinner crust is probably more representative of the NY style  but I still preferred the breadlike crust   So  4/5 star   Still my favorite place ,?
468715,Been going to CEC with my kids for over 15 years  Usually a great time  Havent been back in a while as the kids got older  We did go yesterday for my daughter and a few friends for some games and pizza for her 11th birthday  Nice new games and card system  More choices with the games now  The employees were using a booth right out in the open as their personal hangout/ place to eat  They had work paperwork on the table and boxes in the seats  That stuff should be kept in the back and their hangout should be ina break room and not taking up a booth  Ordered a beer and the girl who rang it up said she was under 21 and couldnt pour it  The lady who could was helping kids redeem tickets  Waited like 10 minutes  seemed simple to switch places but they didnt seem concerned  Probably wont be back for a while  Time for the dave and busters type places ,?
468875,Been going to Harts since I moved North in 2003  I have watched it grow from pretty much just Dr  Hart to the addition of additional doctors and assistants  Dr  Hart  the other doctors  and her staff have always been friendly and knowledgeable  The office is full service  so if you need xrays or surgery  it is all done inhouse  The office is clean and has been recently updated  Located in a small house in a residential area  it could be easily missed  Appointments are always taken on time  When I first started going here years ago  that wasnt always the case  but the addition of additional doctors and staff has the office running like a well oiled machine  That being said  the doctors still spend the appropriate amount of time with each patient  I only trust my furry family with Dr  Hart and her excellent doctors and assistants ,?
468983,Been going to Med cafe for years  A must visit for me every time Im in Madison  Their Algerian tea is sweet and super tasty ,?
469393,Been going to this anytime for a couple years now  Friendly staff and pretty decent equipment  If you plan on working out from 4:306 on week nights  plan on being there a while because equipment is hard to come by when its so busy  Overall a nice facility!,?
470215,Been here 3 times so far  all have been great! First visit I got the BBQ pork burrito  super tasty and refreshing  Second time I got the Mexican Street Burger  again  awesome  This time I got the Supreme Tostada Nachos  Soooo good! I love that the menu has a pretty big variety of stuff  because I dont always want a typical burrito/etc youd expect from a Mexican restaurant  It was busy and the servers were busting their behinds and we were still in and out pretty quick  The servers are all so kind and cheery  I have an IndiCard so I use it whenever I go for the sweet discount (dont worry  the amount we save is usually what goes to the server for their tip  for example  our bill tonight for 2 sodas  Burger Nachos  Tostada Nachos  and a fried ice cream was only $21 with the IndiCard hookup  so we tipped $20  Winwin  right?)We want to come back on a Wednesday for the Trivia Night with our friends soon  :) Thank you  Nacho Daddy!,?
470321,Been here 3x in the last month  consistently average service  average food  and    NO SOPAPILLAS   Cue sad music!,?
470390,Been here 4 times now   great efficient service  their dry cleaning doesnt bbq the fuck out of the buttons on my shirt  slightly more expensive than the cheapest dry cleaning ive ever had but cant complain Alterations are expensive  find someone else to do them  other than that  this is a great place to do laundry/dry cleaning,?
471173,Been here a couple times now and its definitely on my top five delicious spots in Vegas  Croque madam was so rich and delicious Baguette sandwich with ham and cheese   holy hell   sweet  crispy  chewy sourdough  Amazing Got a bunch of pastries that did not disappoint  especially the cannelle  Had never tried anything like it  Like a little  chewy bread pudding tart  Off the charts  Seen a few bad reviews on here  and although Ive only been twice  the staff was attentive and informative and I thought the space was super charming and Im a super fan  Now  please excuse me while I eat this quiche ,?
471380,Been here a dozen times & everything is always so delicious!!! The margaritas are so smooth & tasty & of course my favorite the pork tenderloin & who can resist the corn muffin    yes  they only give you one so u must share to enjoy!!! Too bad this year our service was sub par  waited a very long time for bread  had to pour my own wine & our server who was nice  forgot that we ordered a side relleno     maybe better luck next year,?
471513,Been here a few times already  Regular serving of food  Family operated spot  the mom always has a smile  Food is on point  The teriyaki chicken/beef is a bit sweet for me and overly sauced  but to each their own  My other friends dug it  Lunch bento boxes are priced right for what you get  Hence why Ive been back multiple times  Still exploring the area but Im a creature of habit ,?
471950,Been here a few times and wasnt so pleased with the service  The Five stars are not for the store but for the cashier that was at register 8 today around 3:15 pm  His name was Nicholas  What a great asset to this store  He should train a lot of the other employees on how to treat customers  He went beyond his job and carried a conversation that he started just by paying attention the the items I was purchasing  Definitely Manager material  Thank you Nicholas!,?
472919,Been here a few times   Customer service is always iffy but when it is busy  forget it and walk away   Went when it was busy one time  we were seated next to another two people and our tables were together   It was very awkward   The service is also extremely terrible during busy times   The sushi is excellent and their lunch specials are great!  Would recommend going at a odd time when they are not busy but still expect just mediocre service ,?
472969,Been here a few times  A couple of times were carry out  and once was sit down  There food isnt amazing  and the staff isnt anything to write home about  The sushi I got from take out was warm  and they got my order wrong  There are much better places around ,?
473422,Been here a number of times and went this time for the Motley Crue residency   Awesome show with crazy pyro   The venue and seating were well above average  the cocktails were fine  and the security and organization to keep things moving were fine   You cant expect perfection at a concert because people are people and lots of people always creates some issues   Either way  always love seeing concerts here   Staying in the hotel makes it even more convenient ,?
473689,Been here around 4 times and always loved this place  This is probably the only AYCE place Ive been to so far with unlimited sashimi available  Good food quality  The only bad vibe I got from today is my female server  She looked annoyed the whole time and I have not seen her smile once since I sat  She made my dining experience a little uncomfortable but everyone else here is so kind  Hopefully she looks happier my next visit if shes here again Thanks for another great meal  Hikari! Im so happy ice cream is part of AYCE now! Woohoo :),?
473765,Been here before always superior service and food; best in town! I would recommend this place to anyone hosting family or out of town visitors wayne ;),?
473890,Been here before service wasnt great to begin with   only thing that kept me going back was the atmosphere and the back patio  So we decided to take my brother and his gf for her 21st so no one seated us we decided to head to the back and as soon as we sit down the waitress in the back asked if we were to seated back there and I replied no in to which she replied well the back patio is for customers who are ordering food if we want drinks only then we have to sit at the bar  Mind you weve  sat plenty of times back there and ordered drinks and never had an issue   So we head back in and of course the bar is full and were getting no service and decided just to leave ,?
474481,Been here half a dozen times  I like the rock decor   guitars hanging in walls  bands and djs on weekends  Touchtunes jukebox  not too brightly lit  Outside bar in back is always popping  The food is good  The mussels are outstanding  Calamari and tots good  I tried the turkey reuben recently  I didnt care for how dry the inside of the sandwich was and how greasy the outside (bread) was  Service has always been good  Fair prices Now the bad  Parking can be impossible if you come late on the weekend  You pretty much have to park in the back parking lot which is small and is for several other establishments  Also  they have left the front and back doors open on more than one occasion and it was COLD and letting cigarette smoke in  I choose to sit inside to stay warm and not breathe cigarette smoke  I didnt ask anyone to close the doors but I was uncomfortable enough that my girlfriend and I left early ,?
474789,Been here many times for lunch as I work really close by  Every time I am there  they always greet me by name and even remember my usual order  The food is always top shelf and well prepared  All food is made to order  which ensures me that I get my food steaming hot just the way I like it  I would pay more if they offered footlong subs  which sadly they dont  It would also be plus if they sold french fries  Overall great place to eat ,?
474915,Been here many times! Great food  great service  Amazing happy hour  Hosts have always been welcoming  servers always friendly  Robert at the bar will make your drinks just right!,?
474986,Been here many times   Every time is better than the last   Whether its sushi in the tea room or seated at the hibachi grill my family always have a good time ,?
476011,Been here quite often  love their kbbq and love their brisket sauce  Prices are understandable however service can be a tad bit better  was a few times when I would order a drink and have to ask for it again or have dishes missing  Quality of meat is pretty standard and you do get a large variety of choices for the price  PARKING as always is a pain here and you should expect at least 5 mins or more just searching for an open stall  Please do not park on the sides of the walls or unmarked areas as I have seen cars getting hit that were parked in places they shouldnt have been  Be prepared for an additional wait as there is almost always at least a 30 minute wait time for this place so note that in advanceOverall though place is good and will be here pretty often :D,?
476285,Been here several times for both dinner  lunch and breakfast and we always say to each other  why dont we eat here more often? Granted we live here but I think that the food  service and ambiance are pretty good We have done the Sunday brunch  average for a buffet  they do omelette to order and have lots of things to choose from  Lunch was out by the pool  sandwiches were great and just what we ordered  Dinner has been good as well  the fish and chips are very good as well as steaks  I like the soups  these are fresh and made from scratch  There are some chef specials  the chef here is great  I should visit it more!,?
476342,Been here several times in the past with good food and service but this time was surely different   Seated promptly and friendly  beautiful rose for the lady and a nice booth   We made our selections and when the entrees came out we noticed both my filet and her lamb chop were under cooked  I could deal with my filet but her lamb was still blue  I notified one of our waiters and our main server came over and took part of the lamb back for further cooking  It came out a few minutes later burnt on the outside and still extremely rare on the inside  She couldnt even eat any of her $60 lamb chop  The server never once came back to check on her  no one addressed our obvious discomfort and then we just got presented with the bill   For what was my favorite romantic restaurant to take my lady I was extremely disappointed   I dont see myself returning ,?
476507,Been here several times  a classic little breakfast diner with a nice menu of breakfast and brunch items with nice twists  My personal favourite and a bit of an addiction is the eggs Natasha  basically a smoked salmon eggs Benedict on tiny pancakes with black caviar  its amazing  The staff here is always friendly and generally run by an older staff that is always on their game  A great breakfast spot ,?
477620,Been here twice for lunch   Both times have experienced good food and good service   One of my friends is on a glutenfree diet  and there several dishes are gluten free  though the server stumbled a little and had to check it out before coming back and pointing them out   She did it cheerfully so still full marks   I had the paella  and it was delish   Very nicely made and the seafood was very good   One of my friends had burger and fries and the fries (which were tested by the table) was crispy on the outside and soft on the inside (yes!)  Overall  good noise level  high ceilings   One small minus  unless you get a table on the mezzanine up front or a booth  you will be seated at a table with high bar stool chairs   If you are uncomfortable with those  make sure you point it out or ask / reserve something else   I didnt like it  my legs dangled   Otherwise god place  fast service ,?
477647,Been here twice in 2 years  The rooms are very modern and clean  The beds are very comfortable  Location is great  too!,?
477686,Been here twice in the last 24 hours  Not sure why we went back again after the service was bad and food is average  Probably because we are staying at the hotel and it was convenient  No thanks  we have vowed as a group to not return   It is very confusing because it seems like there is plenty of staff in their red shirts  they just arent doing their jobs ,?
478852,Been here twice  This old school shoe store is a relic of the past but has helped me in a pinch to get to the future both times  First time I was in pretty desperate need of All Weather Protector for new shoes that Id gotten at the end of winter  No place had a can of suitable size to cover all shoes  but Williams did  and it wasnt expensive at $12 a can Second time I needed a pair of black shoes in about 5 minutes before hopping a cab to a friends wedding and they got them for me Not to be mistaken for Town Shoes  but a good shop with friendly owner and employees who know their stuff Walk on down   ,?
479167,Been in for a manipedi twice now and it was lovely!  Mandy does such a great job on my feet  super gentle and careful   Also had a full face wax and my skin feels great (I have sensitive skin and am prone to breakouts following a wax)   Definitely making this my goto place for nails and waxing!,?
479603,Been looking for a great Dim Sum place for a while and ran across this place which isnt too far from my place  I cant remember the name of the dish that I had  but it was delicious  My fiance and I went out on a limb and tried some shark fin dumplings and squid  While Im quite familiar with shark anyway  being Caribbean  the squid kind of surprised me  For some reason I wasnt expecting it to be served cold  but it was still good  The texture kind of threw me off a little bit  as it has a slight crunch  but I still enjoyed it! I cant wait to come back to take part in the actual dim sum menu to see how good the options are!,?
479796,Been many times traveling through while on business  Go here  itll surprise you  Wonderful Chinese food from a great couple owning a local business  It wont disappoint you! Go and youll understand what I mean  Orange beef  lunch specials and chicken dishes all very good  Highly recommend!Enjoy ,?
479840,Been meaning to come here for quite a while  Wish I wouldve come sooner  Great looking place and the food was awesome  I had the brisket French dip  OUTSTANDING! My girlfriend had the baby backs which were also very good  Were definitely coming back here  Good job guys!!!,?
480534,Been seeing Dr Webber for about 2 months now and look forward to visiting always  Staff is always friendly and helpful  Dr Webber has been extremely helpful with getting rid of discomfort and solving any aches or pains that I have  Definitely recommend stopping by!,?
481442,Been there lots of times since they had opened  Their food and service were good at that time  but last three time visit was horrible  Food tasting was pretty good and lunch special is also good  but the service was very uncomfortable  The server always looked angry  always didnt bring some stuffs and even showed attitude to us  There was hair in a soup  so we complained  We didnt eat at all  but they just charged all food cost with 10% comp  We didnt say anything since we thought we are regular customers  Anyway I wont go back  Ban chan 1mile up there food taste and service is much better,?
482181,Been to 4 vape shops in town  best service and best help Ive received and best staffed   Not much of a wait   Peter was extremely helpful   Definitely recommending this place to others and will definitely be back for more flavors and upgrades  Only thibg I didnt like was they didnt have a restroom lol,?
482544,Been to Nile a few times and the food is always great    Service could use some improvement   My friend had to ask for a sauce 3x before they brought it and it was halfway thru our meal   Also  the waiter brought us one check and did even ask if this was together or separate and walked away   They were busy so we decided to just give all our cards and have him split it for us   However  some of us had additional items that when split the check ended up paying for other items   it wasnt much but still a waiter shoudl always ask ,?
482779,Been to Wasabi several times and have never been disappointed with the food  I always go for the hibachi and usually pair it with some sushi  Consistently delicious  Service is usually excellent as well  The only reason Wasabi doesnt get five stars from me is because it can get a bit pricey  but if I had the money  I would eat here every night!,?
483857,Been to this location many times  they are not too bad when it comes to customer service  Selection of Computer components could be much better  but they are close by and convenient ,?
484330,Been to this resto a few times and always had their specialty: a nice chunk of meat (a k a steak)  Always cooked to perfection  This last time  I wasnt really in the mood for red meat so I tried their tuna tartare  It was ok  but didnt hit the spot  Lesson of the day: stick to their specialty  That being said  the pouding chomeur was divine! When reserving  ask for a seat outside to enjoy what little we have of summer ,?
485095,Been waiting for ten minutes with no one to greet me or give me a menu or take my water  The place is empty except for a few customers in the corner at one table  Chick is yelling on her cell phone on the patio outside extremely unprofessional  As Im typing this she just showed up and simply asked me  Yes? Got me a menu and went right back on her phone  I am not buying food from here or ever again  heading to Merkato ,?
485248,Been walking around during looking at cars for 30 minutes and not one salesperson came up to me to ask if I needed help or what I was planning on purchasing ,?
485529,Been wanting to try here for awhile and finally had a chance during Arizona Restaurant Week  My wife and I were both satisfied with our meals  The Stetson salad is as good as advertised!  Due to the couscous base  we had leftover that we were able to eat the next day  My wife had the short ribs which were very tender  I had the lamb lollipops which were okay but Id probably get something else if I went back  The restaurant is pretty expensive so thats a definite drawback for a return visit  Service was very good!,?
486348,Beer has been improved  food still relatively good  service is pretty good too!,?
487596,Before I came here I had no idea what Nepalese cuisine was like  I left wanting to learn more  We had the Chicken Sekuwa and the Mixed Grill with some garlic flat bread  The Chicken Sekuwa consisted of about 6 strips of chicken treated in Nepalese spices   The Mixed Grill was a hodgepodge of meats consisting of Tandoori Chicken  Chicken Sekuwa  Lamb Sekuwa  Himalayan Kebab and Shrimp  Both were cooked in their clay oven and were delicious   I found myself introduced me to flavours I never experienced before  especially the Himalayan Kabob  It was a bit gamy  but I love game meat  The server suggested that we get something saucy as well for our meal  but we chose not to   I kind of understood what he meant as it would of been nice to dip the bread and meat in some sauce  The portions are smaller and it isnt the cheapest place (per portion size)  but I think worth the price because of its uniqueness  I will definitely be back very soon ,?
487730,Before I even took my seat outside I was greeted with a menu and silverware  And before i even opened the menu i got ice water and so did my dog! Who joined me for lunch on the patio  The interior was very inviting with its shades of green  and A/C  But I choose outside on green furniture  Not just patio furniture but wooden chairs and good tables  But if my shirt was any thinner I would have splinters in my back  The wooden chairs are worn from the weather outside I placed my order for the golden soy chicken delight  It was delicious  Chicken was crisp on the outside and moist on the inside a perfect portion or excellently cooked veggies  Broccoli  squash  peppers  and cauliflower  And my choice of jasmine or brown rice chose jasmine and it was good Dessert and mint flavored drinks were tempting but I just had my meal and water and walked out for under twelve bucks The reason I am giving it a 4 instead of five was the splintery chairs and patio floor needs to be pressure washed ,?
488448,Before Uber and Lyft competition locals would complain about not being able to get cab service out to the neighborhoods   I kind of feel like that is the issue with Metro   Of course calls are prioritized and of course some days are busier than others but I have had a couple of issues of open crime and disturbances and no one ever comes or by the time they do its all over   It kind of leaves you feeling shaken and all alone ,?
488621,Before choosing an audio shop to upgrade my stereo I visited 3 stores  Sounds Good To Me impressed me the most  They are very knowledgeable and took the time to answer all of my questions  They were willing to work with some equipment I already had  Their communication and service was outstanding  I had sound deadening material installed and I am very pleased with the results  Thanks Mark!,?
489680,Before this salon opened I KNEW Id be checking them out  I saw one of the owners  Kenny  installing new stateoftheart pedi chairs and the space was bright and clean  Since theyve opened  Ive been back twice! Mimi and Kenny are friendly  professional and talented  So is the staff  I had the best pedicure EVER at Az Nails & Wax  Between the super comfy clean chair and complimentary beverage and sugar scrub  hot towel  lotion and real oranges  I am hooked  Wish I was wealthy and could go back every week!!! My old salon cant hold a candle (or a file!) to AZ Nails & Wax  Tomorrow Im going to get my hands beautified with gel  Cant wait!!!,?
489693,Before this visit  I had only had Korean style BBQ in Seoul  This was well cooked  fast  and plenty of food  The restaurant itself is the smallest little restaurant but is quite busy! Loved the chop sticks and forks  They also play Korean music videos  which are crazy  but awesome ,?
489914,Before we went into our movie  I reported to security that I observed two people wondering around aimlessly (literally upstairs and downstairs) w/ backpacks  One quickly left when he saw me reporting him  Evidently  its AMC policy that they dont search backpacks  WTH???  #SeeSomethingSaySomething,?
490707,Being a foodie and a an avid food network and travel channel junkie  I totally had to make a stop at this piece   After seeing the Vegas Man vs  Food edition I attempted to do up some crawfish myself   It was alright  not great   So I had to go this place just to taste it   Man oh man   It was awesome   I had 2lbs of medium hot and juicy special with potatoes and a sapporo   Service was great  place was crowded at 5pm on a Friday night   My only disappointment was that there was no bar   I went there by myself and I felt bad taking up a table for four by myself   Also  more TVs would have been nice   you know for those who dine alone Overall a good experience and walletfriendly ,?
491636,Being a holiday and I think this was the most disappointing one that I stayed in  While it may be modernized inside it lacked and everything else  The TV was shoddy at best  It kept losing the video connection  The toilet did not always flush  This shower did not always turn on  The hallway was dimly lit  The elevator and its panel look like I could take it apart and start messing with it  The railing on the pool steps was loose and wobbly  It is one building only and its right next to the highway  Most importantly I think is the curtains that will not cover the windows  So you get the nightlights out the window all night long  I really was not impressed ,?
492366,Being a true blue cebuano i didnt really expect this place would pop up  after typing ngo hiong   being bored and  after a long  night of gambling and drinking  i craved for ngo hiong and lechon   I could say this is as authentic tasting as it gets here in the US of A  And being from san jose ca  i might have to make travel plans to vegas as often as i could ,?
492721,Being an old time Chicagoan I consider myself to be a bit of an Italian Beef connoisseur so this place was a bit of a disappointment  They have signs indicating they were voted the best for years and I can only image the poll was taken at a family gathering  While the sandwich was okay it certainly was nothing special and the fact an order of fries is almost as much as the sandwich makes this place just an over priced fast food stop  There are plenty of Chicago joints in town that have a good to very good beef sandwich and this is not one of them  If your driving past and are hungry this should fill you up and not kill you  but dont believe the hype about it being a best of anything  just another chain trying to fill a niche and in this case perhaps they have stepped out of their comfort zone ,?
494238,Being from the Pacific NW I have say the oysters from this place are the best quality and tasting Ive found in the desert   Shane loves his trade and is proud of the product here   Get place to go for oysters in Phx ,?
494927,Being middleage I have become resigned to progressive bifocals   I did the cheap readers of varying strengths and my vision finally progressed to presbyopia a few years ago   Have been to a few optometrists and have been able to get decent glasses   However  lost my glasses on vacation in August and when I got back I started using my old pair   That was OK until the problem with scratches dead center of my lenses was driving me crazy   So  made an appointment at Americas Best and saw Dr  Stone who was great   Picked out 2 pairs of progressive bifocal glasses for what it usually costs for a single pair   The best part  they came in within one week!  I was fitted quickly by the courteous staff and home with new glasses   The frames are fun and I was able to get a black and a brown pair so they match ,?
495263,Being new to the area  Yelp had some great reviews so I gave them a try  Service was great  pricing fair and repairs done on time  I felt like it was my little shop back home ,?
495462,Being on the primal diet  this place was an absolute tease! Why did I decide to come here? Masochism? Attempt to test my will power? At last  I was strong enough to resist the picture perfect cronuts and colourful macaroons  and the 50% off pastries  to settle on a decaf soy latte  Im fully aware of how lame this review is so I will make up for it in 5 weeks when I return to eat one of each baked goods this shop has to offer  Prepare for an update fellow Yelpers!P S  The latte was good  my friend had the Nutella baked stick and a strawberry glazed donut  he enjoyed both thoroughly as I sat beside him   salivating ,?
496609,Belfiore has been on of my favorite places for years  Unfortunately they have been closed down for the past few months and when you call the message says they are under new management and going through renovations  I hope they open again soon ,?
496621,Belgian triple threat: Belgian white mussels  Belgian fries and Belgian Trappists trippel beer: so good!!! I couldnt stop sopping up that garlicky broth with the not overly sour sourdough bread! Delicious and decadent ,?
496853,Believe me when I say Jessica Green definitely know what shes doing!!My mom took a massage therapy class when I was younger as a hobby   I used to get amazing massages from her and since I moved to Vegas I have yet to find someone outstanding within my budget   Not to mention my husband tends to always get the less experienced of the two everytime we try a couples message Because of the availability  I got to try Jessica 1 week before my husband did and I was so happy not only because I finally found someone good and affordable  Im happy that my husband will soon experience this as well and end his terrible massage trend! A week later  he came home a happy camper! Well done  will definitely be back soon!,?
496943,Believe the hype!    (and also go on a weeknight)     This place is sooooooooooooo good    We arrived on a weeknight and were easily seated at a table  (which was great because this place doesnt have many tables)Door was left open  which was nice  it was a beautiful night Great service One star knocked off because the fish in our seafood soup wasnt that great   Or maybe we just dont like seafood soup?   Nah  we like everything!,?
497401,Bella Patio is by far top notch  Aaron was was great to work with and helped me make the right desissions  and price was incredable  Mike the installer far exceeded my expectations  Not only did they do an amazing job  but also spent the time to correct issues that the original installers missed  Go with Bella  you will not regret it,?

497591,Bellagio is still my favorite hotel to stay at  mainly because of the location  It is not the newest kid on the block  but they maintain it well  The Chairmans Lounge VIP Checkin is really a nice bonus as you avoid the long check in lines  The shops are great and Botanical Garden is enjoyable  The pools are nice  but there is stiff competition  I did not like that there is no electrical outlet by the bed  kind of odd in 2018 where everything needs a charge! They have a dock for your phone by the bed  but mine took several tries to connect to my phone  Still  I look forward to returning ,?
499375,Berry Blendz is another great spot in our area   Lots to choose from here  and their smoothie selections seem tempting  but I quickly narrowed it down to the Acai Bowl It was pretty good  but I just wish it had more strawberries and bananas instead of granola  but thats just my personal preference  Will definitely return to try their smoothie selections   ALOHA!!!YELP 100 CHALLENGE 2013(38/100) Jambas Cousin,?
499412,Berta is such a knowledgeable and great realtor! She knows her stuff and gets stuff done! I love that I can trust her and she does what she says shes going to do  Shes everything you need and want when looking to buy or sell your home!,?
499475,Besa gave me a great cleanup cut on my over grown layers! Would definitely recommend her ;),?
499809,Besides the drinks  i think this place is probably one of the most overrated restaurant in Phoenix  And  I actually like its sister restaurant Postino  Actually  I think the owners are trying to ride the coat ails of its sister restaurants  LGO  Postini  and Chelseas Kitchen   The menu has no imagination  I was reading the menu and was trying to find something intriguing  Perhaps  I has high hopes as the owners are shrewd business people  I should have just had a drink and went on my way  But  I gave Radio Milano a chance   Roman artichokes  $10?!  The meatloaf dish we ordered was marginal  The vegetable plate was soso  The housemade pasta tasted on par with chef boyardee   After spending $90   I left with an empty taste in my mouth   Plus  the dished are pretty small  Only bright spot was that the service was good and the waitress was attentive  But  I go to restaurants for quality food  not high priced crap ,?
500998,Best BBQ Ive had in Las Vegas and Ive traveled all over the south with my cousin who wins BBQ competitions all over the country and this is right up there with it  Everything here is amazing from the perfectly smoked meats (brisket  chicken  pulled pork  homemade hot links  and more) to their sweet and spicy sides (mac and cheese is a must!) the corn nuggets are my favorite and the homemade chipotle coleslaw has just the right kick  Genuine brewed sweet tea and homemade sauces to throw on those ribs  If youre a Carolina BBQ fan youve gotta have their Carolina sauce  Mike the GM and his wife are such down to earth people who know southern hospitality   This is our new go to BBQ spot!,?
501361,Best BBQ in the city! Great atmosphere and even better food  Was my first time here and would definitely say it wont be my last  Nothing like this in the city  and the food is incredibly creative and delicious ,?
501898,Best Bloody Caesar in Montreal!!  Yes we were visiting but we had many in different cafes and restaurants  We could have drank 20    did we   who knows?Breakfast was good  I tried the homemade gravlax and yes!! so good with my poached eggs  Egg sandwich The scene cool  hip and mellow  The background music was wonderful  Loved it  I also liked the neighborhood ,?
503002,Best Chinese around!!!!! Great ambiance and wonderful service! Super friendly staff too    I wouldnt listen to any bad reviews for this restaurant   everything is wonderful all the way around  Highly recommend!!!,?
503185,Best Chinese food ever! I dont make a trip to LV without going! Great ambiance   its not cheap  but Ive even been with people who dont like chinese food and like it  (Those people should get salt&pepper chicken or shrimp   I think its called   fantastic) Its amazing! Must try! Kansas City Foodie,?
504242,Best Diesel mechanic in town! Really cares about his customers and wants to make sure everything is up to your standards before he even lets you pay a dime  He has helped us so many times and made my husbands just ok truck become the truck of his dreams  Would recommend to anyone!,?
505007,Best Gelato in town!!!If you are near Rainbow and Durango you HAVE to stop by and try it!If you are not in the area and are in the mood for Gelato  its worth the drive!Its creamy its smooth  not super sweet   Very creative flavors  Follow her of Facebook for daily flavors!,?
505148,Best Greek food Ive ever eaten  Everyone is so friendly and the place is spotless  Prices are fair and you get a ton of food  Highly recommend,?
505325,Best Greek salad Ive ever had and authentic! Very good eggplant dip and hummus  Pita bread count have been better  wasnt bad but wasnt a little too toasted for my taste as I prefer it to be warm and soft  Shrimp and scallops dish was good  The potatoes were cooked perfectly  Very friendly staff and cute atmosphere ,?
506651,Best Italian beef in the Valley  hands down! The Chopped Salad and Beef Cheddar Croissant are delicious  Of course the hot dogs are noteworthy as well  All in all  the customer service and quality of food are unsurpassed!,?
507132,Best Japanese all you can eat bbq! We have been to all Jap BBQ   but this is the cheapest and best service place among all  Be prepared to wait if you are coming here for dinner  The service was fast  When our server was busy  other server always took the initiative to help us  Our server was trying his best to serve us above and beyond our expectation  Definitely will be back!,?
508397,Best Mexican food I have had since ad the bean and cheese burrito and a cheese tostada   Sooooo good   Salsa was fresh and tasty   Everything was hot and tasty   We have now found our favorite Mexican restaurant   Plus the owner was fantastic!!,?
508457,Best Mexican food Ive had in a long time  Close to my house and open 24 hours  Great daily specials  A must try ,?
508646,Best Mexican food in Las Vegas  Too bad I went with my ex so many times  or else Id frequent Casa alot more  Fajitas are top notch  salsa could use a little more substance  Good service and parking is never an issue ,?

523607,Best coffee in Montreal and probably in Canada  The patio is amazing and the environment is super relaxed  I moved away from Montreal a year ago for work and this place is what I miss the most  Theres a regularstatus hierarchy youll have to get used to  as youll probably be served after people behind you in line  But its worth the wait ,?
523634,Best coffee in Scottsdale  the food is solid as well   Start with a pourover coffee and make sure you seek the opinion of the barista when selecting which beans to brew   In addition to providing exceptional singlecup pourover coffee options  the food delivers   My egg  cheese  avocado sandwich on spout bread was an outstanding breakfast   They could use a few more tables and chairs inside  however  when the weather is not too hot the outdoor seating expands their options ,?

The staff is amazing and they seem to make it a point to remember your name and your order  We have been coming here since it opened and they always remember us and what we like  Everything we have tried here has been great!

I was SO happy! It came complete except for one thing  Missing a rack  I called and to my surprise they were so helpful in sending me a new one and it just got here a few days later!

524428,Best crawfish in town  but I just wish that they cleaned the shrimp because the vein is still in them ,?
524767,Best curry dishes in town  and the service has greatly improved since they opened  Portions are large and satisfying  and there is a good variety of menu choices  The panang is my favorite  closely followed by the dish with cashews (cant recall the name)  The free fried dumpling appetizer is a nice touch  The only thing that keeps me from giving 5 stars is that the food served does not always match the description on the menu  Even when we specifically ask for what is described  it will usually come with onions added for example  or missing the peppers  Thankfully the quality of the sauces and ingredients makes up for it!,?
524814,Best custard place in town! I visit here a few times a week and I am always satisfied! Drive thru line moves pretty slow but other than that I cant complain  Plenty of toppings in the concretes! Best thing to get is peanut butter cup concrete with chocolate custard!,?

Been using LD Tours twice a year for the last several years   Broke down only once and they rescued us and then gave all of the kids gift cards  and they gave me chocolates  which is all you need to do to win me over   The drivers are always nice and more than likely have more fun than the kids   If theres puking  the drivers are there to help and they always carry extra trash bags   The owners are two super nice guys who care about their customers   The office staff is always incredible and helpful   You call  they answer; you email  they answer   Customer  King at LD Tours!,?
526055,Best dentist I have ever been too  Jackie  Rex  Ava  and Dr  Lam are friendly  professional and do a wonderful job  Highly recommend this dentist!,?
526131,Best dentist ever!!! I still go to Vegas for my dental work even after moving to CA    I dont trust anyone but Dr  Sanchez to do my dental work   He is honest and I always feel like he keeps me involved in what he is doing   The girls in the office are also always polite and helpful ,?
526226,Best dentist office in Arizona    Seriously I dont have enough good words to explain dr goodman & his staff   Compassionate  happy  thoughtful are just a few I could use!  From a cleaning to removal of some baby teeth the assistants hold your hand and reassure you everything is going to be ok   My daughter (9) hates having teeth removed but knows she is in good hands when I take her in   She even told me she loves her dentist because he is gentle   Now thats a winner in my book ,?
526727,Best dive bar in town  one of the best places to catch live music  Venus is your friendly neighborhood bartender  Plenty of old locals as well as college hipsters  Great beer selection and strong cocktails  video poker as well as shuffleboard  booths and plenty of room to dance ,?

527991,Best exotic car rental near the strip  Newer  lower mileage cars in great mechanical and cosmetic condition  Excellent customer service  Jessika and the whole team took excellent care of us  They were able to accommodate an early pickup with less than 24 hours notice  The Lamborghini Gallardo we had initially booked was taken in for maintenance shortly before our early pickup  and Jessika arranged for a free upgrade to the more expensive Ferrari 458 Italia Spyder  No hidden fees and no attempt to sell us extras  The quoted price was the exact outthedoor price  Royalty Exotic even recommends good local driving roads and approximate time required to complete the drive ,?
528313,Best experience for sushi in Charlotte last night  You will feel you are in New York City  The fish was very fresh!,?
529304,Best fish tacos Ive ever had  anywhere! Fried calamari was delicious and the dipping sauce was soooo good! I hate it when calamari is chewy  and this was def NOT chewy Servers might be overly attentive  always someone coming up asking how everything is  or asking to take plates away  I think I was only there for 20 minutes yet had 3 different employees checking on us every few minutes  Was a bit much but on the bright side  its better than not at all  Another thing  the tacos are messy  would be nice to have napkin dispensers right at each table instead of by the drink station ,?
529437,Best flippin glazed donuts on the planet and they are open 24hrs  Employees are gracious and always apologize if I have to wait more than 5 minutes in the drive thru line (cars in front of me)  I would  have given them 5 stars but I went there on Tuesday because I received a mailer advertising $0 50 glazed donuts on Tuesdays  I was informed that I could only purchase one glazed donut at this price    what the heck?!  Mailer ad said nothing about limit of one $0 50 donut per person ,?
529876,Best food ever   Everything tastes good and the chocolate cake is top notch   You cannot go wrong   Eat and enjoy ,?
530024,Best food in Toronto  not just vegan but food period  Ive been here three or four times and I just love the flavours and how I feel after eating the food  comforted  full and happy  The jerk seitan  salad and roti are my favorite but the magic is in how everything mixes in the plate and I am hooked  Thank you so much!,?
530474,Best free thing to do in Las Vegas   Go at dusk ,?
531126,Best gel manicure I ever got  When Im in town this will be my #1 choice  The place is filled with all men which surprised me in a good way  I could tell they are annoyed by the loud Zumba music next door  That didnt bother me at all ,?
531547,Best green curry in Gilbert!!!!!!! By far my favorite thai food place   Great customer service! Never a long wait ,?
531669,Best grocery store to shop at especially if you have little ones  They offer a wide variety of truly organic foods and snacks  You can actually read and understand the ingredients on the back of most boxes! Best location Ive been to in Las Vegas ,?

536079,Best macaroni and cheese in Shadyside! The burgers and sandwiches are also satisfying  but on the heavy side  On a recent visit  they had curried mussels as a special and it was a real treat  Their cocktails are delicious and complement their menu  Always looking forward to their frozen lemonades and was pleasantly surprised to see that they have expanded their menu to include frozen cider This is a regular drink and dining spot for us ,?
536772,Best meal Ive had anywhere in a while  Great service  Lots of fun things to look at  GO HERE!!!,?
536950,Best meal prep Ive ever had  Bomb food and excellent service  What more can you ask for? Perfect if you want to eat healthy and dont love cooking ,?
537279,Best mexican food everrrrrr   Seriously   Not as greasy and more authentic than Fiibertos   Fast and friendly service  great prices  and its always clean   The decor in the dining room is pretty hilarious  but all the more character it adds I guess  My favorite part is the vegetarian options   Try a veggie burrito with added potatoes (theyre not actually just potatoes but more like tiny french fries)  put a little red AND green sauce in it  and get ready for heaven ,?
537777,Best naan bread Ive had in a very long time! And it was really cool to watch them making it in the ovens Having said that  the curries  whilst appetising on the menu  werent as great as Yelp had made them out to be  My lamb korma was bland  and my rice didnt come out until well after my curry  at which point I had filled up on curry and naan Id be willing to give it another shot though  and its definitely worth it for the bread!,?
537851,Best nail ever! I have been seeing Holly and Jeff for 8 years and I am never disappointed! They are always so much fun and makes my nail time a great experience! I highly recommend this place!,?
537950,Best nail salon Ive been to in AZ and I have gone to many nail salons   Make an appointment with Tracy she is the best  I go to her every 2 weeks   I dont go to anyone else  but I hear that the other ladies do a good job also ,?

539450,Best part of the night was the hostess  She was Very nice   Our waiter on outside table was just an order taker  No hello  No welcome   Just a what can I get you to drink drinks still not out after 20 minutes  I asked him if I need to go to bar myself and he said they are coming  10 minutes later he brought them out  30 mins for drinks! Dinner order was taken  again no recommendations no info just wrote it down and moved on   Dinner was bland and tasteless  I would have mentioned this to him had he come by for a quality check   This point just wanted to get dinner over with and pay tab   Had to ask him for tab  Gave him credit cards and that took another 20 minutes   Been here many times before and each time a little less enjoyable than the 1st   This time it was a total disappointment  Service 0 starts  Food 2 5 stars   Just overall horrible ,?
540678,Best pizza I have ever had!! The service was amazing and my kids loved watching the pizzas get made!They are super authentic and the new little shopping Center they are located in is absolutely adorable   I love the idea of communal tables   We have met so many nice families here   I really feel a sense of community and bringing the neighborhood together!,?

542219,Best pizza in the country? Nope  Good pizza? Yes  I wasnt expecting much  so I was pleased when the pizza turned out to be pretty good  The crust was nice and bubbled with lots of little black bits around the edges  Good crunch on the rim and a good chew going towards center (thats what she said!)  But the highlight for me was their red sauce; not too sweet  just a bit of tang  a little spice  and very well rounded  It really made the pizza for me  Their other sauces or lack thereof  left a bit to be desired when alternating bites between pies:http://www yelp com/biz_photos/pizzeriabiancophoenix?selecttL440Sn0GC3w2KoITKk8Rw#tL440Sn0GC3w2KoITKk8RwI was told horror stories of the lines  but we got there just as the opened for lunch on a random week day and the place was empty  Id go back if in a pinch in Phoenix ,?

542837,Best pizza you will ever have!  My only complaint is that if you decide to actually go eat inside  like we did  it took about an hour to get our pizza!  I started to get a little pissed off with my screaming toddler pouring peppers everywhere an jumping all over the seats  but when the pizza gets to the table  everyone is super quiet with a mouth full of yummy pizza!,?
544172,Best place for pho in the city  I have tried them all and this is the one I always come back to for more  The woman who takes your order is quick and abrupt  but she is very friendly once you get to know her  I love the little old man who seats you when you come in the door  and serves you tea  You have to ask for water if you want it  I love the tofu in lemongrass curry as an appetizer  The sauce is so good I wish I could put it on everything  I usually get pho with chicken or the specialSpicy soup  The ingredients are always so fresh and just taste so healthy  The food is very flavorful and perfect after a weekend of riding my snowboard  If you are looking for authentic pho then this is the place to go!,?

552062,Best sports bar and best bartenders in town  They keep the patrons on point and ensure everyone has a great time  Best wings in town   (Always go double grilled   thanks Matt)  Wish I had this crew in Colorado ,?
553508,Best sushi Ive had in a long time  They have more varieties of sashimi than anywhere Ive ever been  Also some really interesting dishes but I stuck with the sushi  Great drinks and beer choices,?
554082,Best sushi in area   Once they get the right service  this place will grow on word of mouth ,?
554349,Best sushi in town  Hands down  Just saying  )But no  seriously  for the price  you couldnt do better! People go for atmosphere these days rather than the quality of food and getting your moneys worth  This is the place to be if you actually want good sushi!,?
554475,Best sushi place and great ambiance  Their sushi chef is amazing and i love the creativity in his cuisine and furthermore the food is super fresh! The staff is wonderful and very attentive to the clients needs  Personally this is my favorite sushi place in Montreal  the food and decor makes Ryu a fun place to go to  Keep up the good work and phenomenal food Team Ryu!!,?
555242,Best tacos hands down!Thanks for great service food and entertainment will return again soon and highly recommended to try this place,?
555873,Best tasting Pizza in town and best value  Great service you may have to wait a little but thats because they are busy  You can see its a family run business keep the great food coming and service ,?
555949,Best tasting pizza around  Consistency   Seems like they run a tight ship there   Fries are fresh cut and remind me of Potato Patch ,?
556238,Best thai in Cleveland and possibly the US   I travel a lot for business and often try Thai restaurants throughout the country   While most are good  I have yet to find one as exceptional in taste and quality as Bangkok Kitchen right here in Lyndhurst  OH   The curries and noodle dishes are all delicious and appetizers and soups are scrumptious   No need to drive any further than Bangkok Thai for a delicious trip overseas ,?
556435,Best thing about the meatloaf dinner is the mashed potatoes  The meatloaf itself tasted sour  and like it was more breadcrumbs than actual meat  Cheesy dinner roll would have been good but they microwave the heck out of it which leaves the middle of the roll rock hard ,?
556586,Best things about Craft Kitchen*kids menu (they give you two sidesfruit  French fries  or chips with all their kids entrees)*breakfast all day!!*patio seatingThe food and coffee is delicious (they do offer soy and almond milk substitutes)   I wish they had a location on my side of town ,?
557540,Best vegetarian egg rolls I have ever had! The vegetarian pot stickers were really good too  Our waitress was great  She was clearly very busy but was attentive and helpful  My husband and I were really just looking for a quiet place to sit for a little while to get away from the game day madness before the Ohio State game and found some of the best food of our trip!,?
558236,Best wing place in Etobicoke  Good vibe and service  we went to another place in mississauga they told us 30 minutes wait  So we drove here in 8 minutes and had an amazing wing special I would recommend to anyone that loves quality wings at a good price ,?
559306,Best  Ice Cream  EVER!! The workers were very kind and humble as well  Highly recommend!,?
559376,Best  Pastas  Ever   We showed up at around 5:30p for an early dinner with our son  who just turned 21 (in Vegas!) and were happy to find out they had a social hour until 7:00   Do not miss on that menu  short rib bone marrow agnolotti and the duck and foie ravioli  literally last meal worthy   Also  the pork belly was amazing   The $7 00/glass Sangiovese was surprisingly great (we ususally dont opt for happy hour wines)   We also ordered The Spaghetti with added meatballs from the regular dinner menu   It was the best spaghetti we have ever had   Dessert was the incredible mascarpone cheesecake with a perfect double espresso   We luxuriated in one of the curved booths close to the entrance which was private but let you observe the comings and goings of the restaurant   The decor  music  ambiance  etc  is first rate   Last  but not least  the service was superb   Friendly  efficient and professional   This was a true 5/5 dining experience and we will definitely be back,?
560192,Better portions than subway   Nicer interior   Overall pretty good   Had the sour dough sub roll   Nothing special and basically too much bread ,?
560493,Better than London!This place has the best fish and chips Ive ever had(along with Flippers fish house)   The batter is light  not greasy and the halibut is so dense and flavourful   Their hand cut fries are also delicious and perfectly cooked   The best part about their fish is that you never see or taste the mushy slimy part of the fish that I find too often in fish and chip places   The quality they use is the best ,?
560506,Better than McDs but I am not a fan  I ate here when it first opened up and never went back until my office order it last week  The burgers were tiny and there was nothing special about these burgers  BLAH  Sorry    I dont understand how there are so many great reviews  Perhaps you havent had 5 guys???,?
561313,Better to grab a can or use bell for shuttles  Long lines  Long waits impatient travellers  After waiting an hour and seeing that we were at least 2 more busses away from boarding we used the taxi que  Do not recommend ,?
561586,Between my mom and I  we eat here about once a week   The food is always great   I havent tried a thing yet that I didnt care for The chicken lettuce wraps are very good   They are served with a plum sauce  The generals tofu is amazing if you are vegetarian!  Lightly fried  crispy  and served with a sweet  mildly spicy  garlicy brown sauce   Yum!  The ginger chicken and curry chicken are also other favorites  After eating here  other local takeout Chinese places wont cut it anymore  If you choose to dinein  the wait staff is very friendly and attentive ,?
562213,Beware of Fraudulence !I tried to close my accounts and thought everything was settled  Several weeks later  I received a letter saying I had to pay some banking fees  which is weird because I thought I closed my accounts  I went to the bank and discovered a negative balance of $120  an amount which came out of nowhere  plus $50 service fee  Unbelievable  The staff said they will resolve the matter  and that never happen  Very disappointed  Their ATMS dont work properly either; I tried to withdraw some cash  nothing came out  and guess what? Account balance deducted  Again  they said theyll do an investigation  which didnt happen and will never happen  Worst experience ever  This bank is a fraud In the end I had to pay them $170 for nothing  It was such a waste  Seriously  avoid this bank at all cost ,?
562362,Beware of getting any auto maintenance work at Terribles!! They have truly lived down to their name  TERRIBLE!!  The service people that performed my last oil change admitted they messed up my oil plug   I then went to my my mechanic to repair the damage  and after a significant cost went back to TERRIBLEs for compensation    After submitting documentation and receipts for my expenses  heres the response I received from their staff:there is no indication that Terrible Herbst caused what you have claimed due to a  lack of evidence to investigate In other words  TERRIBLEs does not stand behind their work! Again  BUYER BEWARE AT TERRIBLES!!G  TerBerg,?
562879,Beware of this restaurant if you have any food allergies  They refused to make ANY changes to the menu items regardless of my food allergies (I asked for one of the salads without tomatoes and cabbage because Im allergic to them)  The waitress interrupted me to say  We dont make any changes to our menu items  no substitutions or subtractions  Even after I explained that it was due to food allergies  she wouldnt budge  This policy isnt noted anywhere on the menu or in the restaurant either so I had no idea until I was blindsided by it while trying to order  Needless to say  I will not be giving them any future business ,?
563014,Beware the free breakfast buffet promotion!  I stayed there for 2 nights and on my itinerary it said Free Breakfast Buffet for 2 per stay and upon checking in the agent told me Each day there is a breakfast buffet   After eating there both days I saw on my receipt I got charged for the 2nd day   According to the manager this was because it says per stay  and that it doesnt mean each day  only once per stay   So at the end of my stay I had an additional charge of $53 for being tricked into eating the buffet   Other than this I had a great time until I checked out and found that I was tricked ,?
563547,Beware!!!  Non disclosure of hidden fees associated with service diagnostics  No up front disclosure  In fact they waited until my car had been taken back to the service repair area before they even mentioned any fees prior to repairs being done  This is a poor business practice which border lines on criminal intent  What a waste of my time  I made them bring my car back to me and I will take it where I can trust the technicians and I know I wont be ripped off   just by walking in the door ,?
564034,Bewildered that this biz has high marks for reviews  as soon as I declined their repairs  true colors revealed   consider yourself warned  price gauging at its best  overtly strong sales/scare tactics  They quoted $1029 for repairs  dealer quoted $650  that is without mention of prior quote to dealer  Do yourself a favor  avoid like the plague ,?
565225,Big Chinese food chain! This place is a safe bet if you are not familiar with Chinese food yet you want to give it a try  They accept credit (yes  unlike most Chinese places)  better decor  good service  I dont know how authentic the food here is  but I have nothing to complain  Thier turnip patties though  Both of my thumbs are high up for this dish! Crispy on the outside and fluffy and smooth on the inside  the right amount of seasoning and spice to them! I insisted on ordering congee just because the place is called Congee Queen (like my logic? haha)  Got preserved eggs and pork congee (classic) very good and flavourful  Also got this fried noodles (dont remember the name because my boyfriend ordered it) which was also good  Generous portions (took leftovers to go)  Reasonable price Overall  I mean if you are lazy to look for good Chinese restaurants  give this one a try! There are multiple locations throughout uptown ,?
565240,Big Con    Cash only  ATM available but for a $3 charge  (To be fair they will take $2 off your meal to make up for it  but you still end up adding an extra $1 to your meal and honestly  it was probably the worst taco I have ever had  After being told their fish taco was the best I would ever have in my life I ordered one fish taco and one carne asada taco  The fish tasted like freezer fish and was literally a deep fried fish stick    and I do mean stick as in it looked like a lincon log and didnt resemble fish at all  Carne was bland  dry and btw     $8 50 for two  tiny street tacos and a small drink! Not even a side of rice and beans    nothing! Far too expensive for such small portions and mediocre food The people were nice enough  but have major improvements to do to the menu  I would say they earned their 3 5 rating ,?
565592,Big O came through for me and my wife from the beginning as they helped us get our tires replaced at a big discount through a prorated warranty with the manufacturer  My tires were ordered in  paperwork filed with manufacturer and tires put on quickly & professionally  No high pressure to by a warranty  just selling you what you want while sharing all of the add ons  The finishing touch was fully dressed (tire shine) tires when I picked it rather than sending me off with chalky sidewalls covered in writing  Thank you for a great experience  will use you again ,?
565606,Big Papa Trattoria is like East Side Marios (Italian paraphernalia covering the walls)  the big difference is the food at Big Papa is really good   Its a little west  so downtowners might consider it a bit of a trip to get to  but its right at Royal York subway  so really  its not that hard  My boyfriend and I had lunch here  I had the mushroom risotto which was probably some of the best Ive ever had  Massive chunks of mushrooms  not too salty and not to bland  good consistency (not too runny or sticky)  SO GOOD  My boyfriend had a veal parmigiana sandwich with a caesar salad which he said was also very good  Ill definitely be going back for the risotto  but I also think Ill go check out their Nutella sangwich on Italian toast with espresso for 4 95 (maybe theyll let me substitute a decaf tea?) ,?
565743,Big View offers so much variety its a great place when you have diverse tastes amongst your group or family to appease!  Something for everyone & all delish! Excellent value  we often get two meals out of our entrees  Dinner & lunch for tomorrow?  Hey  Im down with that!  The beef brisket stroganoff is wow   SO good & the shrimp & grits fabulous & unique from other versions Ive tasted  Also  we met with Tina in the Big Views Bakery regarding our wedding cake  She was super helpful & kind and made the process pleasant and simple!,?
566067,Big complex and rooms are clean although a bit small and terrible view   unless you consider a view of Hooters and the airport a good view   The conference center is a bit of a trek  so if you are there for work  wear something comfortable or youll regret it!!!,?
566104,Big difference between friendly and PUSHY Asked multiple times if we wanted MORE food  at least 3 times   We ordered 2 big meals  plus appetizer  its enough   Then the push for desserts  multiple times   Left feeling awkward and slightly annoyed   Felt like a nail saloon that harrasses you for extras w manicures  pedicures   Some days it feels like its best to just not leave the house  ,?
566327,Big fan of Deer Garden because you can pretty much pick whatever you want in your noodle soup  Unlike what some ppl commented  not all of their soup broth is MSG free  (it actually specifies on the selection sheet which ones are MSG free)  the more flavourful ones (laksa  tom yum  etc ) do contain MSG  Also  their XO sauce is very delicious but it is not limited to just one per customer like some people commented  My personal favourite broth are the chao chou (fish based) and the tom yum  Laksa is also delicious! $10 75 a combo includes choice of soup broth  2 toppings  choice of noodles and a warm drink  Cold drinks and some other warm drinks are available at an additional charge  Takeout orders dont come with a drink but you can add a small fee for it  Also  you get 10% off on take out orders of over $20 ,?
566518,Big fan of the Sunday brunch here  especially the sangria bar  Its a great way to finish off the weekend  The burgers are good too  my personal favorite is the hangover burger with a fried egg (actual hangover not required thankfully),?
567066,Big meh   This placell do in a pinch  and there are some popular rolls they do pretty well (spicy tuna and salmon come to mind)  but ultimately its cheap  mediocre sushi that you order because they deliver for a reasonable price and not because its really that good   Avoid the gyoza  its gummy and flavorless   Choose the shumai instead   And certainly steer clear of the Chinese food section of the menu unless youre okay with eating a halfstep up from mallfoodcourtChinese Worst of all  though  last time we ordered from them  we got a yellowtail roll that had definitely begun to spoil   My boyfriend ate one piece  decided it tasted funny  and I smelled them and something was definitely off   Thankfully he didnt get sick  but I doubt well be ordering from them again ,?
567227,Big place  lame service in the sense that appetizers come out after mains and kids meals after the grownups  They got you hooked though if youre from out of town because its hard to find real places to eat! Rolls dont taste like much of anything although the garlic edamame was fried and delicious  Makes you wonder why places like this invest so much $ in the show and apparently so little in the food!,?
567542,Big props to the employees working tonight  I called at 937pm after I got outta work about ffxv and if they still gonna be open so I can pick it up  She said shell wait for me so I can get my game tonight!!! Even stood in line for the Nintendo Classic Edition release and I must say the staff here was polite and friendly  By far the best Gamestop Ive been to in Vegas  and willContinue coming here for my gaming needs ,?
567563,Big restaurant with a buffet containing a good variety of Indian dishes  Unfortunately several of them werent hot  which was concerning  The health inspection sign on the front wall had a score of 90    not good! When I got home  I checked the previous scores and this place had scores of 72 and 75 in 2017!?! Finally  the previous restaurant in this location had an open kitchen with wrap around windows  Godavari has draped up black fabric along the inside of the entire length of the window  completely blocking any view of the kitchen  It looks so odd  it makes you think they must be hiding something to go to that ugly extreme   There are at least a half dozen better Indian restaurants between Ucity and Concord Mills  Skip this one ,?
568900,Bill Hayman was great! Simple and fast service   I will be using these guys for all more overhead repairs,?
570053,Birthday present arrived in a cooler bag with a balloon  Perfectly chilled fresh fruit  so good juicy ,?
570176,Biscuits and gravy with sausage patty is top notch  and the soda didnt taste funky like in so many places    Its incredible how lousy the service is every single time   But I will be back ,?
570882,Black Camel aka YAAAAS!Hands down the best sandwich Ive ever had accompanied with excellent customer service  If you can make me  an awkward person  have conversation  youre probably doing great  I got the beef brisket sandwich with pesto  bbq sauce  and coleslaw around 1 on a weekday  There were a few people grabbing things to go and I was glad I only waited a minute for it  They have around 10 seats in store and although the shop is tiny  it does the job Now onto the mouth watering sandwich  The beef brisket had the perfect melting texture (Im not good at describing meats) and the sauces that accompanied it was delicious! Coleslaw made it even better  They also put a hand wipe napkin inside too which is so cute and shows that once again  Black Camel goes above and beyond Will  Return  SOON!,?
571065,Black Rock Pizza Co  is opening in the former Red Star Liquors space at 114 S  Race St   U  Longtime residents may remember it as the home of The Embassy tavern Black Rock will sell thincrust pizzas for lunch  supper and late night They also have hot grinder sandwiches & salads Chilled cocktail shrimp is displayed on ice  Just displayed Black Rock has live music during happy hour on Fridays  The pizza joint will still have the old Embassys classic back bar  The place will be brighter lit than in Red Star Liquor days but sadly  in compliance with a new federal law for mediocre restaurants  will have dozens more TVs than customers want Tattoos and nosepiercings will not be required as when it was Red Star ,?
571396,Blade is super nice and she always shows great customer service  The food is great  Their muffins are soooo good ,?
571591,Blah  I was just unimpressed  even worse  I did not really like the food  even left it unfinished  The staff was very nice  and it probably would have gotten one star if not for that  Maybe I went on an off day  regardless I will not be going back ,?
571907,Bland Mac n cheese  ordered it with green chili and onions and had to dog to find any  Meat loaf too drenched in red chili sauce  uninterested waitstaff and fairly unprofessional  Drinks were good though  Pricey at $65 with tip for the experience  Also one dimensional menu  Wont be back  Addendum: we both got sick as well  Obviously without testing the food we cant say definitively it was from 13 north but we were both fine before  A yelper sent me this link  Explains why we got sick  this is probably why you guys got sick    maricopa gov/EnvSvc/OnlineApp   ,?
572131,Bland katsu don  Venue was plain  Food were over priced for the quality of the venue  Service was not bad,?
573253,Blood and feces covering the clean towels left in my room  Manger attempted to remedy the situation  but this level of uncleanliness is truly disgusting  I will never stay at the Hilton on the Strip again ,?
573380,Bloody great pies! Thats for sure! Theyve earned their reputation  My steak & cheese today was excellent with a light flaky pastry  lots of tender pulled steak and cheese ,?
573910,Blue Dot Pools has outstanding customer service! Needed a quote for a new motor   they scheduled me right away and came out ontime  and were able to assess my needs  The office staff is incredible  she sent me a quote within 30 minutes of the call  Very professional  reputable company!,?
574806,Bob and all the guys at PC Laptops were so nice and knowledgeable  They went above and beyond to make sure my laptop was working perfectly  I went back a second time with other questions and concerns and they wouldnt charge me for the extra work they did on my laptop  I highly recommend PC Laptops to everyone!,?
574899,Bob installed a pool fence in our yard last summer  I forgot to review it at the time  but we were very pleased with the service and the price  He cares about the kids he is protecting ,?
575177,Boba is not as good as the LA Volcano Tea  but hey  Ill take what I can get out here    LA Volcano Tea is the best in the world  imho ,?
576558,Bomb gym  Love the retro vibe  Hate that they have a no gym bag on the floor rule I have too much stuff to carry/need during my workout to put my bag in a locker  $50 for a week pass was a steal  Bf and I loved the equipment too  such an awesome variety,?
576775,Bomb! The graham cracker ice cream was the best  Everything was fresh and everyone was really friendly  I love how they have such a wide range of flavors ,?
576781,Bomb! This place never disappoints  The line is usually super long but well worth the wait! If you are in Vegas this place is a must!!!! I always manage to eat here at least once every day while I am in town  Everything here is good!!!,?
577096,Bomboba is the BEST boba in town and I have tried them all  If you want the sweet bursting flavor of boba with the most creative tastes and combinations ever ( razz banana) and the have a live band too!,?
577604,Bond is a gorgeous bar right off to the side  The drinks are expensive but delicious and a couple of them where really strong  I give three stars because the DJ started the night off right with really good house music that made us want to drink enough to dance  but then a couple hours in the music turned into top 40 garbage and the sad part was we finally felt like dancing (this was my friends birthday) and yeah the music then sucked  We picked this bar because we wanted house music (real house music) and that part was a let down  Also the waitress didnt come by our table often as I would have liked ,?
578240,Bonus! Not only are we within walking distance but this Pub has friendly staff  good food  cold beer  great happy hour and a large patio! We sat at the bar our first time here  enjoyed a refreshing beer while we watched some football as we waited for our Cajun Pasta and Steak  The pasta had amazing flavor (not to spicy) and the steak was cooked exactly how we ordered it  and oooohh the mashed potatoes :)  It took a little while to receive our food but we werent in a hurry  we will be back!,?
579298,Booked and prepaid online for a pickup at the airport   When we arrived we called and said they were sending a car and it would take 20 minutes  Ummm  Why did we bother booking to wait? Well they said they didnt get the correct flight info   Ok so why not call and leave a message so we could call back or even simply look up the friggin info! Fine  Waited 20 minutes and nothing  10 more minutes we call again   The driver went to our house instead of picking us at the airport!  Waited another 20 minutes (with 10 minutes of waiting in the rain because they said they were pulling up now)  Never again Update:  After about a month someone personally contacted us and apologized and kindly setup a refund for half of the total cost of the trip   Then the refund took about another 2 weeks after I had to contact them again   I am adding another star to my original review and I am reconsidering to try them again soon ,?
579491,Booked my room via Hotwire and saved over a $100! The hotel is nice and within walking distance to the main downtown area  It isnt super close to many of the bars and restaurants that youll want to try  but convenient for business or theater locations  Decor is a bit old school school  but it fits within the time period the hotel was built  The main lobby area is impressive with high ceilings and crystal chandeliers  I didnt have time to try the attached restaurants  but they do have a restaurant  whiskey bar  and speakeasy which seemed worth a try if I had more time  The staff were really nice and friendly and made us feel welcome throughout our stay ,?
579746,Booked this as Interval Time Share Exchange   Room nice enough   Grounds well kept   BUT it was a quarter mile from closest parking to car! (No exaggeration )   Bell hops in carts available if you dont mind tipping when you bring in a bag of groceries or return from shopping trip  etc   They do NOT leave extra face or toilet tissue in the room but do bring when requested   No remote for DVD player  and remote for was so worn we couldnt read keys     little things add up quickly We have stayed at nicer places in Scottsdale using Interval Exchange but will not stay here again ,?
579953,Booked two months ahead of time  They overbooked the hotel and then they messed up my reservation  Despite the reservation being in a nonsmoking room  they tried to put us in a smoking room and would not change it  Not trying to be picky  but we suffer from respiratory conditions and my buddy is elderly  so its a bad situation that could end up in the hospital or morgue  Upon cancellation  they charged a $60 fee that they refused to waive despite the error being in their end and having no rooms  I even have confirmation paperwork with non smoking listed on it ,?
580099,Bookmans is like the nerdy version of Zia  I mostly go to find some comics or random action figures ,?
580375,BoooYaaaa!!! Up $500 in three hours at the poker tables    Not that that is unusual with my experience  but awesome none the less  My girlfriend saw the Beatles Love Cirque De Sole show and I played my little heart out in the beautiful poker room  Everyone had a great time and I only wish we didnt have rooms at The Palms because this is one of the nicer casinos in Vegas  Didnt get to eat  but this place is super friendly  clean and fun A,?
580511,Boot camp is hard core but I love the spin class   People are friendly ,?
581648,Both cables fell with out warning on my garage door  I instantly got a Yelp and started looking for companies that maybe able to Help  I got a lot of quick responses but Garage doors 4 less was the first to not only address my issue but go a step beyond and inform me that the cables were probably not the issue so much as the spring was  Sure enough without even a picture Adrian was able to find the real source of the problem  give me a fair quote and get someone out right away  His technician was on time  quick and did great job   Highly recommended ,?
581840,Both my boyfriend and I caught a nail fungus at this place after getting a pedicure here  I havent been back and dont recommend them at all ,?
582308,Both of the stores are stellar in my book and pump out the best palets and ice cream in the Midwest! Come here for the most decadent ice cream in the land  and that says a lot about life in Wisconsin  The Cajeta  dulce de leche de cabra  is goats milk toffee ice cream and is extremely rich and creamy  The paleta/popsicle  has a center of said toffe and nothing like I have ever experienced before   I have purchased many gift certificates for coworkers to expose people to this places that they would not have known about it  They also offer shakes  fruit snacks  nachos  juices  fruit filled popsicles with chile  etc  Get here and try somthing new ,?
583423,Bottomless mimosas are amazing! Had the chorizo burro it was so good! Also if you have Wes as your server  he will do an awesome job! This man was very attentive and a great server!!!!,?
583500,Bouchon Bakery is a great place to get your macaron fix  Huge chewy and sweet macarons for $3 50 each  A bit on the pricey side  but these are your larger than average macarons The pistachio flavored one is my favorite! Yum yum ,?
583814,Bought 2 used vehicles from them and both were more than pleasant experiences!! Would have bought from them a couple weeks ago but they didnt have what we were looking for  After dealing with jay Honda in Bedford thus last time  we regret marhofer couldnt help us! Next time for sure!!,?
583982,Bought a new used Acura 2012 without tint  Dan set me up and thoroughly explained the differences between the tints available   Great price and awesome work  Highly highly recommend his work  He had it done in about 3 hrs flat ,?
584377,Bought a Groupon for an 18 buck oil change/ car wash  Asked the tech before I started how long it would take  45 minutes tops was his reply  Well it took an hour and fifteen minutes  Bummer  I dont mind waiting if one is just up front with times  Under promise over deliver is the best policy  Also  I have a 2012 car pretty new  The technician put on my sheet that my air hose clamp was missing  It wasnt missing before I got there and now after he takes it off and brings my air filter to show me it  it goes missing  No Bueno  Affordable price  decent wash  Wouldnt spend the 48 bucks it came out to but for $18 I might do it again  Depending how much the clamp costs me ,?
584513,Bought a Groupon  called to schedule and got a to  Of excuses why I cant use it whats the point?Terrible marketing!!,?
585015,Bought a deal with Amazon Locals for my wife to get her hair cut and washed   Wife called and made the appointment with Linda  and received an email confirming the appointment   Appointment time and no hair stylist   She just plain did not show up and when my wife enquired as to where she was  they got her to call and she had the nerve to ask my wife to wait for two hours for her to show up   Fortunately  the shop refunded  the money for the gift I gave my wife   Would not recommend this place at all ,?
586748,Bought my home so I needed to have the chimney checked before I could use it  Chimney Crickets was great  They came on a weekend  They were in time  Quick  Reasonably priced  And they didnt leave a trace of that they had been here at all  I highly recommend them ,?
587055,Bought some beautiful flowers online for a friend that looked like a little dog super cute! Great service and product    will be using them again!,?
587118,Bought some popcorn here and it was expired by a year  I ate it anyway because Im a lazy POS but I regretted that decision shortly thereafter ,?
587909,Bourbon  whiskey  vodka  wine    so many options and you can sample any (except the wine)  It gets pricey the better the alcohol  but makes such a nice gift! Well worth it!,?
587949,Boutique Websites customizes websites to fit your business need  However  I needed a specific logo to be created  He designed a Cat logo keeping in mind that I wanted to be artistic  appealing and original  He later told me that he had to draw out the design using a specific software program  When I first saw the logo  in purple  I was speechless  It was more than I could imagine myself designing it  Being creative and innovating  he certainly caught my eye in knowing what his customer wants in a logo  First try  and he got it right!! Verdict: I would certainly go to Boutique Websites to create a logo that is true to my business  Also  having web design as another offer  I just need to go to one company which is fantastic  I already know they can produce quality work  so the more services provided the better ,?
587982,Boutiques are called boutiques because they have small and selective inventory  What makes Vintage Grace special is that its incredibly well curated clothing at a reasonable cost  True story  I dont leave without with buying something (or multiple things  The clothing is very trendy  Its not necessarily going to be staple pieces  but who wants to shop for those boring things anyway! I love colorful  fun and girly  and I feel like that describes this place so well  She also hand makes jewelry  I believe theyre all crystal based items  very blingy  She also stocks a small selection of shoes  purses and catchy tees and tanks with cute sayings on them  I will note  they do not sell vintage items  Im an avid vintage shopper and when I first saw the name and I thought it would be vintage items  Doesnt matter  I still love it!,?
588425,Boy oh boy  Not once  not twice but three times a fail  This company is a major headache  Not only did they ruin my first batch of cards they screened up my 3rd attempt at an order and over charged me for a quote I never authorized  I called to speak with the manager and he said he could offer me 15%  really after messing up repeatedly ? That was my fault trying to give this company another chance  Lesson learned dont even bother ,?
589054,Boyfriend was randomly browsing around for a good breakfast place to eat at when we went on our Vegas trip for the summer && Earls of Sandwiches popped up  THE NUMBERS DONT LIE! One of the best valuepriced meals on the strip weve came across! I had their Ham Egg and Bacon breakfast sandwich with a side of Chicken Tortilla soup  ( yes  its simple  but Im pretty picky when it comes to my bacon and soups) everything was on point  no complaints  The boyfriend and a friend of his had the Carribean Jerk Chicken sandwich  they could not stop raving about it throughout the whole meal  Every bit comes with a compliment  DEFINITELY on our toeat list next time were in Vegas ,?
589161,Brad Garretts comedy club is located lower level of MGM  Very beautiful and upscale inside  Tables are a little to close for my comfort  the people sitting next to me kept hitting my arm  The servers are very friendly as well as the host staff   They greet you at the door and then they take you to your seat  The comics that we seen were hilarious  I laughed so hard I was crying   Mike Merryfield was my favorite  that dude had me belly laughing  The only downside to the facility is that theres no bathroom within  You have to leave the club and use a restroom outside in the hotel/casino area  Which is very very small and  always had a long line  The club serves drinks so if you drink and have to go to the the bathroom you will miss a chunk of the show  So I wouldnt drink a lot   Four stars because of the bathroom situations and the tables being a little to close ,?
590399,Brandi is awesome! She does the best hair styles ,?
590996,Brar is a great place to go if youre with a large group of friends who all want to gorge themselves on obscene amounts of Indian buffet  Its completely vegetarian and there are literally hundreds of food choices to make  Watch out for the breaded cheese balls as theyll quickly fill you up  they are super addictive  You can easily go back six  seven times to fill up your plate with entirely different items  And thats before youve even glanced at dessert Whoa ,?
592265,Breakfast food is my favorite type of food  Square cafe is one of my favorite breakfast places  Really good food  Generally good service  They seem to always have interesting specials  The place is pretty big  and has a lot of outdoor seating  I have had several breakfast items  and really enjoy their savory items  like the Veggie Omelet  but I think they are really good at the sweet items  French toast sticks with a caramel sauce was a special once  and they were AMAZING  I also really appreciate their special options  as they always offer something different and good   Their coffee is pretty good too Will and have been back and its a place to take friends ,?
592844,Breakfast menu has great variety including gluten free pancakes and bread  Buffet ends up less money than most entrees if u add in coffee and juice etc  Super good with a lot of healthy and naught options  We liked it so much we ate there every day ,?
592923,Breakfast or lunch this is your spot  For breakfast I recommend getting one of their delicious healthy omelets  The hot Juan is a personal favorite  But they also make one with avocado that is equally delicious  For lunch I highly recommend one to get the chopped salad  truly delicious especially the pesto dressing  For dessert pick from any of the delicious cookies or pastries at the counter  Enjoy a mimosa from the bar to help your hang over on Sunday Very trendy atmosphere  Inside can get crowded but there is usually room outside  and in the cooler weather the dining experience becomes quite favorable  Perfect spot for a late Sunday morning or any lunch date  Check it out!,?
593021,Breakfast sandwich heaven!!!!! Great prices  amazing food  Get the breakfast sandwich on the sandwich roll as opposed to the toast  its incredible  They have an amazing looking selection of pastries and sweets too  I cant wait to go back and try their lunch and desserts ,?
593131,Breakfast tacos  Hash specials  Athenian breakfast  French toast specials  Get them all  in that order  Ive tried most of the menu  and Ive never been disappointed  If you are lucky enough to be there while barbacoa hash is the special  dont hesitate  Order it  Order two  You wont regret it  Also: corned beef anything  Hash  Sandwich  Amazing  Made in house ,?
593262,Breakfast was better than several other buffets and being a Hilton Diamond member with a $23 a Day food credit didnt hurt ,?
593503,Breakfast was ok  No need for us to ever return   The kids both ordered chicken and waffles off the kiddo menu  and seemed to enjoy it   I had the blueberry lemonade pancakes with bacon   eggs & hash browns  Pretty Standard    My bf ordered hash browns well done and a side of bacon cooked extra crispy   Bf didnt get his 2 items until after the kids & I had eaten    The bacon was under cooked and hash browns looked the same as mine ( not well done ) soooo he waited an extra 10 minutes for his order why??? The waitress was kind enough to remove the hashbrowns from our bill without us asking  guess we can scratch ihop off our list of breakfast places,?
593720,Breakfastreally a disaster!  Server  only one  was overwhelmed with tables!  She was good  but couldnt keep up with things like more water and coffee  etc   From ordering food to arrival was 40 minutes for 2 of us   From a view of what was going on it looked like the cook could only cook one table at a time before starting the next ticket   Food was ok but nothing that said wed return anytime soon   The omelet was very brown  The chorizo was almost monexistent  the toast came way after the entrees   Hopefully theyll improve ,?
594330,Brent came HIGHLY recommended  Sadly  I didnt listen to the recommendation and attempted three salons in the west valley first  I finally called Brent when another stylist at another salon was unable to meet my expectations  I wanted to go from blonde to dark brown and was still a blonde when I left the first place  I went to Brent two days later and left with AMAZING HAIR  Its a little bit of a drive for me from the West Valley but its is worth the drive and the cost  Brent listened to what I wanted  gave some recommendations and was able to deliver what I was looking for  I will be returning and refer anyone who asks me to him ,?
594490,Brett did blond highlights today for me today  Everyone was super nice & the color & cut came out great ,?
594499,Brett has rescued me many times    even late on weekends   He fixes problems that other HVAC people have only temporarily fixed (I never found out the other company didnt really fix it until I switched the system from heat to A/C or vice versa)   Once HE fixed it  no other calls were necessary   Six years ago I finally needed a new system   Brett and Steve got it installed quickly and my bills dropped considerably (I went with Bretts recommendation)   Six years later I am still not having any issues and Im still saving on bills ,?
595118,Brian gave us a great price on 2 new units after ours died on us   His team was able to get them both of them installed in one day much to my wifes relief   We had been using a different company prior to this but with the service we received there is no reason to go back ,?
595243,Brian is not a good doctor  Ive been to him about 6 times now and each time he tells me the same thing but it obliviously isnt working if I keep having to go back  Do not go to this place ,?
595502,Brian  our tour guide  was an excellent host and very well informed about the brewing process and beer in general The folks at Hop Farm  Couch  Penn and Draai Laag were professional and provided great beer samples I would highly recommend the tour for any beer lover!,?
596254,Brilliant fried chicken with a decent serving of sides  The biggest issue with this place is the constant lineup and the lack of comfortable seating space  Its time to move to a bigger space!,?
596434,Brined eh? It was evident from the moistness of this chicken  The owner is also a very friendly guy who hooked us up with french fries  They didnt have white meat at the time  That didnt bother me since I like dark meat too  The French fries were decent as well  I spotted a nearby location on Victoria Park  just north of Ellesmere I believe ,?
596437,Bring 1s   Cheap beers  Great 80s metal music   Went there on a Thursday night   Pretty much a sausage fest for the 40s crowd   Its one of those bars that  religious guys who feel guilty about going to strip joints hang out at  with the hope of seeing young slutty women   Thats not a bad thing    Again  great metal and rock music   girls in Daisy Dukes and bikini tops dancing on poles   We left after bout 90 minutes ,?
597268,Brisket is good   Service isnt all that  Pricy in my opinion   Small side $2 25  Med $5 75!  One size soda cup $2 25 ,?
598799,Brought a friend and sat at the bar to watch the game  The bartender Natalia was very friendly and attentive The Big Apple Pizza was okay   Very little sauce and the toppings could have been heated longer   $20 for aSmall pizza   expected to be delicious  Dessert was tiramisu was very good  Overall 3 stars,?
599238,Brought in my boyfriends and my Bernese today to the grooming salon for his much needed bath and haircut! All the girls in the salon were very friendly and helpful  Brittany did an amazing job with our Bernese today! Put a lot of hard work into him and we so appreciate it! Thanks again to grooming salon  you guys are awesome!,?
599766,Brought my bridal party here after our wedding rehearsal  Food and drinks were always on point!! Try the gummy break shot!,?
599817,Brought my car here with a puncture in my tire and upon arriving the gentleman was very accommodating and helped me to the fullest extent! Great place to get your tires fixed or even buy new ones!,?
599941,Brought my car to this dealership after planet Nissan tried ripping me off for $2300  Paul was absolutely fantastic in keeping me updated with my car and making sure everything was done the RIGHT way!! The job ended up costing me $416 after the majority of the work was covered under warrantee  I would gladly drive all the way across town just to go to this dealership and know that my car and my best interests are looked out for!! I would give ten stars if I could!,?
600287,Brought my friends here to try as we wanted bubble tea  They were surprised at how busy it was and automatically had high hopes for this place  and they were not disappointed  It was almost 11pm and there were still lines winding throughout the store  I honestly think they should consider expanding their store as they were so busy  They didnt have enough space inside to accommodate the line and people sitting  as the people in line were literally 5cm from the people sitting  I do give them credit though for moving the line relatively quick  The Grass Jelly Roasted Milk Tea was really good  and they followed directions with ice and sweetness perfectly  I suggest if youre a first timer like my friends  you wont go wrong with ordering from their top 10 menu ,?
600620,Brought my parents here on a crazy leafs play offs night tonight  The food is amazing! My Mam said that the chicken pico pizza was easily one of the best pizzas shes ever had in her life  And she repeated it a few times so you know she meant it! Gerry is an incredible chef! The whole menu is amazing  Prices are great too  We had great service tonight by Keanne regardless of how crazy busy it was for the leafs play offs! And the managers Sandra and Jeff  and hostesses Siobhan and Christina  went out of the way to find us a table and ensure great service through out the night as they knew my parents were visiting on holiday! Thanks mathew (the server) for the shots of fireball  the first time Ive ever done shots with my parents and it was hilarious  what a great night the best night theyve had since they got here! Cant thank you guys enough,?
600643,Brought my phone in today  great service and very fair pricing  Was ready in under an hour with a new screen  and they even charged it for me  Highly recommended ,?
601572,Bruce Ly is magical with his amazing latte art!!! And the roll cakes are made fresh and delish!!!! Also probably some of the best coffee in Toronto ,?
601636,Bruce is awesome  Knows every customer by name  He runs a great crew of guys  Will not trust my pool to anyone else  Thanks for all you do ,?
601722,Bruh get your sns french tip done hereThe guy is the master of it  Handdown the best dipper in the industry and let me tell you I am a VeRY picky customer when it comes to the curvature of the french tip  Thank me later and tell him Hanh sent you  Also saves you a pretty penny the sns french tip was 45 dollahs,?
601798,Brunch Buffet  YumI dont like this location at all  Its a strip mall with a cracked up asphalt parking lot  Ugh  BUT    that out of the way  the interior of this place is very stylish and nice The Brunch buffet is great  $16 per adult They bring you bacon  hot items  eggs  waffles  french toast and you go up and get other items   everything from salad to lox Coffee  Mimosas  Bloody Marys       Next time you want to go out to brunch  think of this spot! After you deal with the nasty parking lot  you will be glad you did!,?
601919,Brunch at perfect pear was awesome!!  I loved the pancake that tasted like cinnamon YOU WILL LOVE IT!!,?
601976,Brunch excellent   Friendly and quiet place   The lamb sandwich was to die for   Fish tacos were very good also   Limited beer options but some good local brews ,?
602083,Brunch is $24 and for an additional $5 you can get unlimited mimosas or bloody marys  Brunch comes with king crab legs if you can stomach those in the morn/lunch time  A line started at around noon  but we got there by 11am so it was quick to get in  Service was attentive  except when the BF wanted his 5th bloody mary  Overall its a decent buffet  and I actually sort of like how the seating arrangement is almost cafetarialike ,?
602126,Brunch is awesome   Ive come here on two occasions for Brunch and have left satisfied  Ive had the sausage hash as a wet chimichanga and it was delicious (though I dont know how anything deep fried cannot be delicious)  Last sunday  I got the benedict arnold and it too was great  Even the fake canadian bacon tasted like real meat (though more like bologna  which I think is still delicious)   But the real star of each brunch was the zeppole  Delicious fried donut balls with an sublime strawberry sauce! HEAVEN! I dont quite understand why they just dont use the space from Green to host brunch  since all the food comes from that kitchen anyway  but I guess its a branding thingThe rest of the time  nami is fine  Everything is ok to good  such as the drinks  pastries  and tsoynamis  The donuts Ive had there (besides the zeppole tend to get stale very quickly )I do get a kick out of the fact that their symbol looks like a little poo ,?
602465,Brunch was exceptional and the server  Andrea was awesome  Always order a little less food than you think; so filling  The jojos are a great choice to share  or as an entree  The chips are def deep fried! Egg tacos are a favorite of mine and they did not disappoint  It seems nobody really knows about the brunch yet  because it was pretttyyy empty  So go and enjoy some great breakfast tacos  quick service and quiet scene with no wait    While its still a secret ,?
602778,Brunos tacos were just ok  and Im sad to say  but I just wasnt super impressed First  dont make the mistake of overordering  The portions are bigger than the traditional teeny  tiny street tacos  I was super hungry  and I was only able to finish two  Second  the flavors were either underwhelming or too strong  The horchata (while delicious!) and the passion fruit extra hot sauce were just too sweet for my taste  The fish tacos and poblano guacamole could have benefited from more salt  I also found the fish batter too oily  and just the combination of flavors in general lacking  Lastly  I felt like the price point was way too high for the quality   For 6 tacos plus guac and chips came out to ~$40  To be granted  we definitely ordered two tacos too many  but Ive enjoyed better quality at a lower price point  which kind of sums up my whole experience at Brunos Taco Bar ,?
603389,Brynsley  your flight attendant  fromBurbank to Las Vegas on 12/15/17 at 6:50pm flight 4036 was the most amazing person ever!!!!! She went above and beyond for us! I cant thankYou enough for your hospital! Thank you for being so accommodating  I will fly southwest again and again because of you!!,?
603559,Bubble waffles are my new drug  These delightful little fluffy bites of heaven have won my heart  I could eat these all alone minus any toppings or ice cream  I guess its good that they are located across town from me or I would be there much more often ,?
603812,Bud and Vine is now fourforfour  Ive used them to send flowers to my wife and family and been increasingly surprised by each delivery  To take it a step further  I had flowers delivered to my mom and rather than leaving her flowers on a 100 degree doorstep to die a sure death before she got home  the owner of the store brought them back at 7:30pm WELL AFTER BUSINESS HOURS! Ive always sworn by Tiger Lilly and now this is my flower shop  I would recommend them to anyone looking to deliver super contemporary arrangements  Good people  good product  good service  lifelong customer ,?
603853,Budda bing budda boom!! Just your regular bar food  nothing special  tasted the food worse and better,?
604486,Buffet is mediocre  slot machine area is noisy  smelly and everything is old  Place looks dirty especially carpet,?
605002,BuildPro has consistently done quality work for me since May of 2012  everything from a pergola to kitchen remodeling to bathroom renovation  They always stand behind their work! I can highly recommend their craftsmanship Jerry S ,?
605017,Building an old school rail and these guys have been a big help  I like the variety of parts they offer and its mostly a one stop shop  Mine is an old Beam car and I was surprised that with all the long travel stuff these days they still keep parts I need  See you soon ,?
605070,Built in 1906 and towering 247 feet high  this is a magnificent cathedral   I have attended several prayer services and concerts here  and music sounds quite beautiful inside the sanctuary Outside is a small prayer garden with a beautiful statue   I think it is affectionately called Our Lady of Craig Street   Passing the cathedral from the street  it looks impressive and stately   A beautiful Oakland landmark!,?
605274,Bullseye RVs Caleb is superlative! Fast  efficient  no nonsense  with a wealth of experience    he will tell you what needs to be done  immediately or at some point in the future  He will NOT tell you to replace or fix something that doesnt need it  Honesty and expertise  cant be beat! I rely on him to keep my 2003 travel trailer (i live in it full time) in good repair  I highly recommend Bullseye RV!i recently read a couple of unhappy customer reviews that talked about a Larry at Bullseye RV  i have never seen or talked to a Larry  and given what was said about his work and lack of integrity  i can only assume that he is no longer with the company  i have always dealt with Caleb  who is phenomenal!,?
605394,Bumble Bee deserves its five stars   Good people and they do excellent work   I started out with a wontwork problem  and ended up with the problem promptly fixed  plus educated on proper care of an AC system   High recommendation!,?
605659,Bumping it up a star after a successful midmorning weekday visit  Came in to troubleshoot my phone  Annika was very helpful and showed me what she was doing as she was doing it  She earns the extra star ,?
606114,Burberry was great and juicy   Not every organized when it comes service  ordering or cleanliness   For such a great famous chef to have a disorganized place is disappointing ,?
606497,Burger has a good taste  I ordered the Truffle Mushroom Swiss Burger  but it was small compared to some of the other chain burger joints The above burger  regular fries and regular drink was 11 03 with tax ,?
606976,Burger was not bad but the service was  I had issues with the food and it took 10 minutes to get someone to help me  Not worth the price or the aggravation ,?
607792,Burgers are sensational   Its nice to have something different other than plain cheddar and bacon burger   Ive tried the white truffle and the bleu and bacon   Both tasty  but the white truffle burger is way better   Give it a try   Guy behind the glass is super friendly too ,?
608516,Burned Pizza  Burned Pizza     Let that sink in  They burn pizza and call it fresh ,?
609157,Business is in Peoria not Mobile as yelp shows    Been looking for a new auto detailer for a couple of years and this is our pick   Mario came with 2 other guys and fully detailed my Mustang convertible and GMC Acadia  They were quick  personable and quality conscious  The cars look great and  as advertised  they come to you  which is a huge plus in my book  Go to their site online and they have lots of deals to save you money ,?
609162,Business is no longer there  Building is now a vacant wine bar  Looking at the Papercrazy website it looks like they have moved to a location on Camelback and are only available by appointment  How disappointing ,?
609260,Business visit at Richmond Hills for few days  and I look around for Persian food and I came across this place  I trust Yelp reviews I was with few colleague from seminar  and I brag about Persian food whole time during seminar  It was four of us and I ordered Mediterranean Salad which includes Romain lettuces (looked old)  tabooli  black olives  Hummus  Red Onions  tomatoes  Feta cheese balsamic dressing and also I had Falafel ( solid rock) wrapped in home made Naan (Lafa) and topped with fresh toppings    Food was bad  and also one of my colleague ordered Beef Koobideh Kaboab from menu and when he was paying for it he realized he was charged more and when I asked the guy behind register he gave me long story of renovation  new price  and been short handed  He did not say sorry or anything and at end asked for 5 stars on Yelp ,?
609303,Busted pipe in front yard which went under drive way    Previous builder has not completed the job right the first time   Robert gave me a good quote and completed job no hassles along the way ,?
609317,Busters by the Bluffs is a fantastic pub!  It features a beautiful  fully stocked bar  and solid appetizers  Busters just feels like home inside!  The prices have always been terrific  Back in the 1990s  I played for a Hockey team that used to play at Birchmount Arena every Friday Night  After our game  we would always go to Busters and close the place  Im talking a dozen Hockey players all in complete agreement about Busters  We absolutely loved the place!,?
609909,Busy place on a Wednesday night!  I love the traditional glazed   $9 75 per dozen of original or an assortment Good to treat yourself every so often!,?
610740,Buy all of my furniture from this store  They are always  always deliver on time and if there is ever a problem they always fix the issue! Great company ,?
610771,Buy one get one free roll  Delicious sushi  Great prices  The service is great and friendly  Its a great hole in the wall thats tucked away in the corner ,?
610799,Buy the frozen pizza dough  add some pastries  and all will be right in your world ,?
611228,Buyer beware! The sales reps lie to you and tell you anything to get you to buy the products and services  Jeff told me the contract doesnt matter  Guardian will let you out with no fees  especially if you sell the home  That is 100% not true! $750 termination fee! Oh and only certain departments can tell you that! Always have to wait for a call back because no one is ever available to take a call  even though that is their job! Customer service reps are rude and inconsiderate!,?
611384,Buyer beware   Falsely advertised an artwork   Bought a vintage print that the gallery said was in perfect/pristine condition   It was not   It had stains that were covered up by the matting which I found when I looked under the mat to inspect   Tried to pass it off on me and although they agreed to refund me  were going to make me pay for return shipment to Canada from the US   They should have covered under the circumstances ,?
611552,Buyer beware: looks like the place is under new management  New decor  New staff  New menus  Service was so slow that we were able to look up reviews on Yelp while we waited  saw the dismal change in food quality  and left before anyone even visited our table  Im so disappointed to know that my faithful Asian fusion spot near the house is no more  but Im hopeful that one of the 7 (I think?) competitors within 2 miles can win me over ,?
611985,Buzzberry may not be the best coffee joint out there but it does the trick and it never hurts to support local  The staff is generally friendly and pretty quick  If you like a large drink make sure you get the secret menu large ,?
614430,By far the BEST uber fresh Uni spot in Vegas  The quality of the fish is outstanding and Alfredo at the Sushi Bar is a delight and truly enjoys his job  Delightful spot on off hours  especially early for the top selection of high quality selection ,?
614547,By far the Worst pho Ive ever had in 4 years of living in Arizona  I got the Pho Ga (Chicken Pho) and the broth had zero flavor which is disappointing because Pho is all about the broth  the chicken was cooked well but also had no flavor  Im not sure if this place is new but they need to reconsider their career because this place and food isnt it  Extra note  take out containers are also pretty cheap mostly all Pho places had their broths wrapped in a plastic bag and then put it in another plastic bag with the rest of the fixings but not Pho KC  To sum it all up  Terrible takeout experience  flavorless broth this place deserve zero stars and for the people who gave all the 5 star reviews you should really check out any other pho place in the valley I guarantee youll forget about this place ,?
615094,By far the best Thai food I have ever eaten   The restaurant is clean and the staff is friendly   The most amazing curry ever!,?
616099,By far the best locals bar in LV  Great food  great staff  The bartender Annette is awesome and I love when they put the sound on for baseball playoff games ,?
616365,By far the best pizza I have had  We order for our shop pretty frequently  Staff is friendly fast service without losing the quality  Want a great pizza try this place  Thanks guys for taking care of us ,?
616547,By far the best place to play! My partner and I are avid escape junkies and this place takes the cake  In fact  we have been hesitant to do the last three games because we dont want them to be over! Highly recommend!,?
618507,By far worst hotel Ive ever stayed at      front desk lady cristina is rude unprofessional and not knowledgeable at all!!!!,?
618817,By far  the best hotel in Madison   Have stayed here a few times  and every stay I continue to be more impressed by both the modern style/chicness of the accommodations and the excellent customer service   During our most recent stay  there was a miscommunication regarding our breakfast order   Not only did the staff remedy the issue immediately  but a short time later they delivered a complimentary bottle of wine (thank you!) If you are looking for a modern  immaculately clean hotel in a location that cant be beat  look no further than Hotel Red!  Their customer service also guarantees that this is the only hotel at which Ill stay while in Madison ,?
619323,By the name you could safely guess this is Italian cuisine  My wife and I were both pleased with our dinner here  The food was much better than Olive Garden or Bravos  Even though it was on the expensive side we felt it was worth it  We enjoyed the Formaggi (assortment of cheeses) as our appetizer  Entrees were prepared well and although we didnt have any there is a good selection of wine to choose from  The ambiance was nice  an older style European theme  It was busy and a little crowded during the evening that we were there  Overall this is a good place to visit if youre looking for something a little different or a nice night out ,?
619398,By the time you read this review  I wouldve just finished my 2nd appt at Elliott & Co  The first barbershop Ive been to in several years  Once my barber (Alisha) finished my cut and beard trim  I immediately jumped up and scheduled another appointment  This place its great! I can only describe it as a barbershop  man cave  man spa  The layout has a cigar lounge type of feel    Leather chairs  low lighting  and flat screen tvs  The Lincoln Room is dope    The entire floor is made of old pennies  Nice clean shave  steamy hot towels  and above all  great customer service  The fact that Elliot himself  is the first person you see when you walk in  earns this place major cool points  But with him being the first person to welcome you when you come in  and one of the last to say bye when you leave  puts this place in a class all by itself ,?
619835,Cest bon  mais rien de plus ,?
621336,CDC did an excellent job with our pool remodel!  Jerry was outstanding to work with  and was very helpful and responsive during the planning and construction   We did a complete resurface of the pool/spa  new waterline tile  new 1 tiles on all the steps and benches  new LED lights  salt water conversion  new variable speed pump  and a fully automated wireless remote control system to control every aspect of the pool/spa/waterfall  I have to say  the new automation is my favorite  because now I can be out having dinner with my wife at a restaurant and I can use my iPhone to start heating up the hot tub so its ready by the time we get home   Fantastic!  And their pricing was very competitive on every aspect of the project   Definitely the best pool company in the valley!,?
621987,CLEAN  BEAUTIFUL  QUIET and VERY FRIENDLY  I rarely give hotels high ratings  as there is always something significant that does not live up to my expectations  but the Valley Ho deserves this excellent review  We stayed in the Suite on the 6th wing for about $300 a night  BThe new renovations are of high quality fixtures  bathrooms  bedding  TV and flooring   Even the sliding doors onto the balcony completely block out any sounds outside  even when staying near the pool with screaming children nearby   The staff is very friendly and do their best to address your concerns to your satisfaction   There are pleasant people all throughout the property  Staying in hotels is rarely memorable to me as most of them fall short   Most are not worth going back to   I have a high threshold for good ratings on hotel reviews   The Valley Ho certainly is one to return to ,?
623137,CRAZY!  I literally JUST got kicked out of this store for having a drink in hand   Less than 15 seconds in the door and turned around   I was just about to drop over 2 grand on a tempurpedic today too!  WOW!!!  Im a little shocked     Not even a would you like to leave drink here at the counter?  The funny thing is    There were NO customers in that place!  Guess they dont need my money LOL!  Second time I got shitty service from a Mattress Firm store   Ill take my money elsewhere ,?
623515,CYT Phoenix is more than just theater   It is a safe environment to allow youth to learn discipline  character  confidence and love   It is a family environment where everyone in the family is involved   We truly enjoy the hours of our involvement!  My daughter absolutely loves CYT and calls them family!  They accept her for who she is and stretch her to develop her acting  singing and dancing skills!,?
623611,Cabana is the Wynn hotels poolside eatery/bar   The portions are sizable for the sandwiches and the bartenders make exceptional drinks  The pineapple mojito tastes great ,?
623717,Cabo Mexican Restaurant is another example of how Red Rock could do better  Come on people  this is Mexican food  My Norweigan grandmother makes better Mexican food than this The special prices are reasonable and the food is edible  just not anything youll write home about  I made the mistake of ordering a ribeye in Mexican restaurant once  Probably the worst cut of beef I have had outside of prison (jk)  it was so tough and all sinew Still you have to applaud a $9 fajita or an AYCE tacos special  Like I said  it is edible  just not memorable ,?
623779,Cacao 70 is one of my favorite places to go for dessert with friends! Though the restaurant offers actual food (sandwiches wraps etc ) as well  Ive only ever tried their desserts  Most of the sweet dishes are within 1217 dollars  are very filling and make a great meal  My personal recommendation would be to avoid the fondue here as the containers of melted chocolate are very misleading and are less than a couple centimeters deep  My favorite dish that Ive tried is the ChicoNut Waffle which is a large waffle served with icecream  candies hazelnuts  melted chocolate  strawberries and bananas :) Overall  a great place to be unhealthy with friends and the location is ideal for mcgill students residing in le plateau  the ghetto  new Rez and la cit ,?
623874,Cacuts Jacks was closed for a while  but it is up and running once again   Total dive bar in Ahwatukee  it is never my first choice  however a few of my friends love to go there for the cheap drinks and music (live or juke box)   I have never tried any thing to eat at Cactus Jacks  and I dont plan on it anytime soon Cacuts Jacks isnt really the kind of bar to start out the night  however we have been known to finish our night there  usually when Happy Hour at Brads Places goes a little long  or when were headed back to the tuke from some other event and dont want to stop the drinking fun!When we do end up going there  or even suggesting How about Cactus Jacks?  the rest of the group knows that the night just went from a rank of mild intoxication  to might as well call a cab now!  Crazy things have happened at Cactus Jacks  lots of good stories and foggy memories ,?
626587,Call me a rebel  but I think their dinner is better than their brunch   Ive had brunch at Piedmont once and brunch at Ballantyne once and both were great (my friends love the bacon in the bloody mary) but dinner is some of the best upscale Southern food Ive had    The only reason I dont go more often is sometimes Im too hungry to endure the wait  but if I plan ahead and make reservations it all works out ,?
627493,Called Mr Sitton for a new car key  Jon was quick to respond to my house  He cut a brand new key for my car and was very reasonable on price  He was $300 00 less then the dealership!  I will be using him again  and telling all my friends and family ,?
628088,Called ahead  seated about 10 min  after arrival   The hostess was friendly  but once we were seated we waited for drinks  for silverware   We ended up waiting 1 hour for our food   My omelet had the stem of the avocado in it  not worth the wait   A friendly attentive waiter can often make up for a long wait  but we did not have a waiter like that   The manager gave us half off our order ,?
628402,Called and talked with Steve at Smart Security  Very professional and took care of my families needs  Did a thorough job of explaining the system and how it worked  Would definitely recommend this company to anyone ,?
628881,Called for a delivery of a pizza one side easy cheese and the other side is easy sauce  The pizza was not what we ordered  The wings tasted like they have been under a heat for way to long  As if you were eating styrofoam  Yuck! Giving 2 stars just because they delivered  But gosh  why over an hour with horrible not fresh pizza and wings  Delivery includes only one pepper and one parmesan cheese ,?
629612,Called in for a quote  and told to come inside  When I went inside  it took about 1020 minutes for service since he was helping out at a customer at the front desk  I talked to him for about a minute and received a quote one for the radio and another for the labor  I received a quote from another company Sun Valley Stereo that was $60 cheaper  had numerous reviews  had a 5* rating on Yelp  and seemed more nicer when I talked to them on Yelp   I will be skipping this company and will make the drive to Sun Valley for a better company Overall  it was a waste of time for something that could have been answered on the phone ,?
629684,Called in looking for a part that was very difficult to source  spent 3 hours on the phone calling every place I could find on google with no success and was very lucky to stumble upon L Y  They found the part within minutes and and I picked up the part the same day  This level of service is extremely rare  and the staff are very helpful  Definitely coming back here for all my parts  Id give them more stars if I could ,?
630248,Called on a Sunday  got an accurate quote and was able to schedule an appointment next day  Charlie who came out to replace our water heater is a super nice guy  very knowledgeable  and gave us a lot of helpful hints to preserve the life of the water heater  He was fast  efficient and very professional! I would 100% recommend him  hes awesome and I cant thank him enough!,?
630321,Called one day ahead of time to have 9 pizzas delivered to my childs class room the following morning  Paid for at the time of ordering   Show up at the the location to sign the credit card slip (left a large tip) and was assured everything was going as planned  The school calls 15 minutes after the Food was to have arrived and no sign of the pizza! Called the manager and was given a lot of excuses including shes new here  No one ever called back to explain or apologize  I swear this is just the way customer service  in chain food organizations is going I can say that all the interactions with the staff was more than friendly  This does not however makeup for poor delivery on what theyve promised to provide ,?
630836,Called them to ask a simple question about a price on a mod they sell   Apparently that was too difficult for them as they informed me they dont provide prices over the phone but Im welcome to come down and get a price   No thanks  Im welcome to take my business to a vape shop that doesnt make doing business with them so cumbersome ,?
631177,Called this place for a delivery  I recently moved into the neighbourhood and would always walk past this place with my dog  I stepped in last time and asked for a slice  They told me they dont sell slices just pizzas  So now after Ive ordered    I ordered a deluxe  gourmet pizza with garlic bread and cheese  The pizza isnt bad  I think its overpriced for the quality  I didnt feel this was very gourmet either  The garlic bread barely had any garlic  Overall i give it a 2 5 stars  They can improve  But next time Ill just walk one block to pizza Nova  At least the delivery was fast but it wasnt more then a 2km drive anyway,?
631469,Called to get on call ahead seating and the girl said that the wait would be 20 min  She stated that by the time you get here there should  be a table  We arrived 20 minutes and checked in and then she said its a 30 minute wait  The management need to train their staff to not lie to customers on the phone to draw them in and then to waste their time ,?
632423,Calling all nacho enthusiasts  obviously you get nachos here  Nachos  big enough to share with a friend or two  Good margaritas  and endless chips and salsa  Ive ate here with a friend while she had her pup with her  they did not mind as we sat outside in the front patio  it was a cool spot  cool neon sign you cant miss in the cut  we had lunch on the little front outdoor seating area  good for people watching  and boy is there people watching to be seen on ANY given day or hour    Reasonable service  staff was friendly  attentive  I went on another occasion at night before 90s night at oddfellows just around the corner to grab a bite before drinking and sat inside  it was cool too  we had bottomless chips and salsa and huge margaritas ,?
632464,Calling in to order something so simple having to be transferred a million times  An hour before closing on a Saturday seems enough time for me  Luckily someone wanted to do their job today! If it wasnt  for Hamayas customer service I wouldve thrown in the towel after the second transfer  After her reassuring me she would have someone get a hold of me then taking down my information  I received a call back within  minutes! Maybe we should consult in her for service instead of the parts department phone system  You have the parts I want almost thought twice before coming in  Lets reevaluate  who works on a Saturday though ,?
633511,Came an hour before close when hardly anybody was there  Very slow service and my meal was given away to another patron who came in 10 minutes after me with nothing said about it and no offer to make it right  Staff was more concerned with closing duties as opposed to patrons  Used to love these places but theyve gone way downhill  Wont return ,?
633633,Came around lunch time wasnt busy and was served quick  ordered chili cheese fries with onions and corn dog meal  Everything tasted delicious and satisfied my craving  No complaints ,?
633951,Came back again 3 more times and out of the 3 times the broth has been good on the tonkatsu  it was nice and creamy and flavorful  Not the best ramen in the world but one of the best in downtown Toronto I especially love the soy based dipping noodles  The dipping noodles are different from the wheat ramen ones served here  they are al dente and are thick egg noodles  Delicious!I will come back because I love the dipping noodles here but my wait patience for this place is 20mins and under  ramen should not be a wait forever kind of food!,?
634732,Came back to La Unica again and it never changes  Great Mexican food  good honest drinks  great bar and fantastic service  Treat yourself and the family  This place is my favorite restaurant in huntersville ,?
635190,Came by for a 1 hour foot massage the other night  Called ahead and was able to request a female masseuse  Picked the A package where it included a 10 minute back massage along with a head  scalp  shoulder  arm  and hand massage for $22!The interior was clean and had a few semi private rooms The masseuse was excellent with a strong pressure along with hitting numerous pressure points!During payment  it became apparent that they prefer cash    they do have a sign where they say that a $5 or less tip means that the service was poor?!?,?
636007,Came during the busy holiday season  Poorly organized  poorly tidied  Price labels missing all over the place  Absence of intuitive ways of finding anything  problematic when a store is split into multiple levels like this  Staff all but invisible  one turned and walked away just as we made eye contact  Not a good experience  Wont be back ,?
636826,Came for an early dinner with my sister   Was a bit loud but the music selection was great   They have a smaller menu  but not to small   Wine selection was good too  Great happy hour specials ,?
638383,Came for the 57pm happy hour only but probably one of the best in uptown! No drinks unfortunately  but their food specials were worth the price  especially the burgers and taco menu items  Havent tried their regular menu  but the service at the bar was pretty good too  Check it out if youre looking for some good eats at a value ,?
638576,Came for the first time to do their mimosa brunch   If youre a food snob like I am  please dont come here  The only delicious item was the mimosa   When they brought out my breakfast with waffles   it was all cold  They re made my breakfast and it was still mediocre  They should give up the brunch   obviously its not their forte ,?
638760,Came for the vegan menu  Total bust  Got the tostada salad and the quesadilla  Not exaggerating here IT WAS GROSS  The lettuce was wilted and brown and soaked in dressig  The quesadilla was supposed to have a bunch of fajita veggies including roasted corn and it was just filled with undercooked onions  The waitress was constantly trying to upsell us  The one star is for the chips  which were delicious  Other than that  it was a bad and overpriced experience ,?
639023,Came hear and saw Journey this weekend    My girlfriends family and I went    I had never been here   but I was impressed  I think the staff and management did a great job at the logistics of it all    Drinks were a little pricey   but that is a minor detail  The seating was awesome   stage lighting was great   sound was perfect   and every seat seemed to be a good seat    Another minor detail   staff should keep an eye out for random people taking empty paid seats that arent theirs  Overall   a great first experience ,?
639544,Came here Sunday morning around 1011am  Line wasnt too bad Waited for about 2025mins  Limited seating  but people come in and out pretty quickly  Sign up on the waiting list outside the door**You can park around the corner and walk here  Inside has a old fashioned diner feel  I ordered the french toast with powdered sugar on top w/ fresh fruit  $8 50  tax  tip French toast was ok  nothing spectacular  Probably would not order it again  They are more known I guess for their omelets  but I did not order that as I can get omelets every day at work  Maybe you can come try the omelets  but I am more big on Lunch than breakfast food anyway ,?
639926,Came here a few time for early bird dim sum (the price has went up from $3 to $3 10)   which  while not awe inspiring  still decent and nicely made  The food arrives hot and quick  so the table is filled with yummy dim sum!,?
641208,Came here after hearing about the hype about the North York location  There was 10% off special for their grand opening  We ended up getting a few pounds of mussels  clams  shrimp  and added some sausages and corn to some of the bags  We had a variety of sauces including captains boil  Cajun  and garlic  The seafood absorbed the flavour of the sauces and was quite delicious  This was one of the most satisfying seafood meals weve had in Toronto  Highly recommended  but probably not for a first date ,?
641597,Came here after the American Lung Association Fight for Air Climb  much love for being there for a great organization   Had a couple brews for that post climb rehydration   That Toms is supporting such a worthwhile charity event makes them a winner in my book   Thank you Toms!  Ill be back ,?
641882,Came here again because I loved it so much but they disappointed me my second time here which was the morning after! So we were seated fast but it took around 5 min to order our drinks and 10 min for the waitress to take our order and I ordered coffee and they forgot to give me sugar    I asked for sugar and they gave it to me 10 min later    They gave us our food 30 min after we ordered and when we got the food it was such a smaller portion from the previous day and my eggs were cold!!!! I might never come back   ,?
642017,Came here again with family for Fathers day lunch  Service is good as always  The food quality has gone down from previous visits  Highlights was the beef noodle soup  wonton noodle soup  chinese brocolli with garlic and salt and pepper shrimp  The steamed fish was off with texture and taste  The string beans with XO sauce didnt taste like xo sauce but like chili sauce  Sand chicken was too cold and tough  Extra star for the service ,?
642480,Came here around 4 am for a late night snack  lol  and it was still poppin  Service was great  All of the employees were friendly and helpful  despite it being the middle of the night  I ordered the chipotle chicken sandwich  It was pretty good  The avocado was nice and firm  I hate it when I get avocado that is too soft in my sandwiches/burgers  I wish there was more bacon  I only got a tiny sliver  My friend ordered the sandwich with all of the Italian meats  which was my second choice  Next time  Im trying that one for sure!,?
643458,Came here based on reviews since I was in town as a tourist   My husband had cravings for Chinese food after having a few rich foods and buffet on the strip   The BBQ food is good here and not too salty   We ordered a combo with two choices of BBQ items   We got the duck and pork which both tasted really good   They were surprisingly not fatty as other places I have been near my hometown of Seattle   We had a seat next to the glass window of BBQ and the duck was sold out at one point We ordered wonton mein and beef chow fun in addition to the BBQ   These items were nothing to write about but the service we received was great   If I could accurately give a rating it would be 3 5 stars ,?
643460,Came here based on reviews  definitely not worth it   Sushi was just Ok  What turned me off was the service  They all look so glum and dont even smile at their customers ,?
643715,Came here because I wanted a good steak and didnt want to pay Strip prices for it  I shared the Mixed Hot Antipasti (a huge plate of fried food)  the iceberg wedge and the steak and shrimp scampi  which totally hit the spot to the T  Then we shared two $50 bottles of wine  All in  we paid a little more than $100 a person but the meal was totally delicious and well worth it  My only critique is that service was slooooowwww  Not neglectful  just slow  We were there almost 3 hours  Crazy ,?
644292,Came here because of their Yelp fame so I knew there was going to be a long wait  But I didnt expect there to be a line at the odd hour of 3:45 pm  Thankfully there are plenty of shops open nearby and a couple of galleries :) We got the almond croissant and apple turnover from their pastries rack  They were both good but not too impressive  The almond croissant could have been more crusty  I preferred the apple over the croissant  There werent many other options for pastries as they have already sold out of many options  We also ordered the Cuban sandwich  Again  some of the other sandwich options have already sold out so I would come early if you want full options  The sandwich was the standout for me  The pork was so juicy and succulent and the sauce was spot on  The bread was also the perfect thickness  We split one sandwich between the two of us and it was enough to fill us up along with the pastries ,?
644317,Came here because our neighbor recommend we try it out  not disappointed at all  The crullers are the best Ive had and the cake donuts had great crispness to them  Owners & staff are very friendly  will be back again soon!,?
644727,Came here by accident during lunch and found my new pizza place! I was greeted by the super friendly Michelle at the front  and loved seeing a family ran business  Delicious food  excellent service and great location! Makes it easy to stop by during lunch or on my way home from work!,?
644901,Came here cuz I only had time to grab a quick bite before work  Im pretty hungry I order the biscuit cheddar battered butterfly shrimp meal with fries and a red bean and rice on the side  As soon as I get to the window the chick didnt know my order and asks me what my order was  So I tell her my order and pay then she hands me my bag  First of all the ladys attitude was awful on top of not knowing my order  Then I finally get my food and as soon as I get to work I notice theres no fries and no biscuit     all I got was 5 shrimp and my beans and rice  Which btw doesnt taste as it normally does  Not coming back and not finishing this gross food  I never expect much from fast food but this is unacceptable Ps the drive thru wasnt busy theres no excuse for this,?
645124,Came here during bsides/defcon week  so this place was definitely more packed than usual  However  a restaurant this size should always be prepared regardless of crowd size  and waiting 40 minutes after ordering for our food is not acceptable   For a casino  food wasnt terribly expensive  but it wasnt anything great either  The prime rib melt was eh  nothing extraordinary but still okay  Tequitos and fried zucchini were a little disappointing   but their burrito special seemed filling  If the service was better  Id probably bump my review up 1 to 1 5 stars  ,?
645615,Came here few days ago to buy one of Rich Pianas preworkout supplement called 5150  You can literally find anything here and the prices are unbeatable !! Customer service is top notch; they treated me very well and took good care of me  Keep up the good work guys  ,?
645967,Came here for HH during a working wknd in Vegas    this is located inside the Planet Hollywood Hotel/Casino Cant really comment on the dining experience but I will say they had a great lounge area and stiff drinks  Good tuna tartare and excellent rock shrimp tempura  Service was spot on (at least in the bar/lounge area) ,?
646455,Came here for Sunday lunch right when they opened at noon  Its a little place but the food was amazing  Their portions are HUGE  And I mean hugeee  Me and my girlfriend ordered the big combo and the pulled pork combo  We didnt even finish one of them and had to pack it home  We really liked all their food  The pulled pork were good  smoked wings fell right off the bones  as well as the ribs  The fries were actually really good! It was crispy and fresh  and again huge portion  They were really nice about letting us substitute one of the fries for Caesar salad (even gave us more salads instead of the coleslaw)  The price is also extremely good for the portion! Around $55 after tax and tip for the two  and we probably will get 45 meals out of it lol ,?
646585,Came here for Valentines day  and was highly impressed! The atmosphere was really pretty  and service was also great  They had a special Valentines menu  and the food was beautifully presented and tasted absolutely amazing  I dont usually drink  but their cocktail menu was so tempting that I couldnt resist  cant remember the names of the drinks  plus the menu has already changed  Strongly recommend this place!,?
646838,Came here for a Packers game   It was fun    great crowd   Definitely a Packers bar  which can be a bit daunting if you arent one   Packers fans are special bunch   They have Leinenkugel on draft    big points for that!!  I took advantage of the bloody mary bar    which I think might have been more glorious around 10 or 11   Everything was pretty picked over by the time I got there but I hear they have bacon wrapped asparagus   YESSS   The service kind of sucked    but it was super busy soo its expected   Unfortunately  the Packers lost & the bar CLEARED OUT and lost its luster   I dont know if Id come here again for anything beside a football game ,?
647242,Came here for a birthday party and I have to say it was not worth the money at all  If you can get a groupon for this place Id MAYBE consider it  but otherwise its such a rip off ,?
647384,Came here for a buddys bday  I was amazingly surprised at how good this place was  Their salad (I had the Caesar) was incredible  Their rotisserie chicken dish was really good as well  Definitely on par with restaurants in NY  and in some cases much better than some overly hyped places in NY (Im looking at you No  7!) Ive also heard very good things about their burgers  The food isnt going to blow your socks off with any new unique flavor or flare  They dont have a Picasso working the kitchen but this isnt necessarily a bad thing  It keeps prices reasonable and what they do make  they make it very well  I didnt get to try 30 restaurants in the area but I have to imagine this has to be one of the best ones  I should also mention that the service and ambiance of the place were also excellent  Great place for a special occasion or a nice night out when you dont want to cook ,?
647616,Came here for a continuation of my birthday  We stayed in a beautiful room over looking the lake  The hotel had many activities for its guest  like watching Jaws while on a floaty in the lake lol  Nice lounge also  The room was clean and kept up well  I love staying at lake Las Vegas due to the fact that there is a lot less visitors there and it makes you feel like you are in a small European villages  Although most of the shops are out of business the shops and restaurants that are open are very nice  They have water actives etc   Lake Las Vegas is my go to place,?
647624,Came here for a convention   I dont know why  but they served the same food all 3 meals   and it was terribly!  Dry meat  horrible flavor   so much starch   Even if the people in charge said to do it that the  the catering sales office should not have allowed that  They ran out of food at the final banquet and ended uo bringing the leftovers from lunch out   The desserts were dry  Someone at our table got an eclaire and she picked it up the chocolate slid off  It would have been cheaper and hopefully better at their buffet   The rooms were clean enough  We will probably not be back,?
648172,Came here for a friends birthday     we were seated in a private glass room which was really nice  Our server was very friendly and attentive  I was super excited to try this place for the first time based on other yelp reviews  Maybe it was an off day but our food was meh!!! I ordered the hanger stake which was very chewy  the piece I had was stringy and sauce was on the salty side  My boyfriend ordered the deluxe chuck burger it looked delicious but the it was a sloppy mess  The bun was soggy after the first bite; it couldnt hold up to the egg and sauce  Overall in our entire table the short rib was the best plate ,?
648867,Came here for a menu tasting and it was awesome  The owner was so kind  She went into the background of how the chocolate is made  how she got started and why her chocolates are special and unique which they truly are  She answered any questions we had and was very warm and easy to talk to We started off with a wine infused cakevery moist and yummy not over poweringThe chocolate chart my personal favorites where the pink lemonade and the coconut She also offered ginger spice coffee I didnt get one because coffee gives me the jitters but everyone seemed to love it They also have sugar free stuff ! This place is doing it right  Come here and get you a seasonal chocolate or a regular one!,?
648877,Came here for a midnight fix  I wanted dessert and they opened late  Eh ,?
649099,Came here for a quick bite after work yesterday and had a pretty disappointing experience  Loud music blaring from the bar (apparently DJ on Thursday nights     but it was 6:00?)     music in the dining room was on but couldnt be heard due to the music from the bar  Now it was just competing noise (pick one or the other)  Was seated by the kitchen and bar and wait staff station     was so noisy we had to ask to be moved  Still not much better   Food was just ok and our server was fine  Seems like this is a poorly managed restaurant  Saw a young girl (hostess maybe?) walk through the dining room past our table carrying several rolls of toilet paper?? Not sure where she was going with these as she was heading away from the washroom area  All in all a very disappointing experience  Had heard this was recently renovated but honestly I found it to be a very cold atmosphere  Felt like a Boston pizza or something similar  Will definitely not return ,?
649110,Came here for a quick bite around 6pm and overall it was good  The place is fairly average  Pros Excellent service (short haired blond lady was the only waitress and even though she was the only one in the whole restaurant she was amazing!) Haddock tasted goodPortions are largeConsNone that I can think of,?
650496,Came here for breakfast and enjoyed our meal  We came during the week around 9:30 and were seated right away  The service was exceptional and we had an awesome server and server in training We ordered the chocolate covered bacon which was good just the bacon itself didnt taste all that flavorful  We also had the prosciutto and chocolate chip waffle which was tasty no complaints  and the sundried tomato  goat cheese  and pine nuts omelette which wasnt very good  The omelette was over cooked and dry  Next time if I went I wouldnt get an omelette and might try a pancake or waffle since you cant go wrong with those options! 5 stars for service and 2 stars for food ,?
650777,Came here for breakfast recently  Big portions! Good hash browns and breakfast burritos  Scrambled eggs  though  are overcooked  Definitely worth a visit  :),?
651705,Came here for brunch with my family   Fantastic meal and selection   Service was outstanding as well  Highly recommend this place   Tim was our server and he is awesome ,?
652349,Came here for dinner and loved the sushi here!  They use pretty ordinary fish for their rolls (tuna  salmon  eel  etc )  but they add a creative twist to it   One of my favorites is their Ninja roll   I believe it had eel  salmon  avocado  a minty leaf flavor  and a soy wrap   Good portion size too with 8 pieces per roll at reasonable prices ,?
653527,Came here for dinner with some friends  Ambiance was trendy and the dress was casual  Confused on where main entrance was but realized it was the same as the market entrance We came here for the happy hour menu and it didnt disappoint  The portion size was bigger than my group expected so that was a good thing  I ordered the chicken tacos and the flatbread and I was not disappointed  The tacos were pretty tasty in my opinion but my friends said the nachos were better  The flatbread was a good but my jaw was aching by the time I finished it  But despite that  I enjoyed it  Also had the highball drink of the day  It had grapefruit juice  vodka  ginger beer  and some other stuff that I cant really remember  The drink was good but I couldnt taste the alcohol at all  It was pretty much juice but for $5  it wasnt bad The staff was super friendly and nice  Only reason I gave it a 4 star was because the food took a while to come out ,?
654450,Came here for lunch after shopping at the Forum shops  Let me tell you  this place was awesome! The steak frites were so good  Yumm  Still drooling just thinking about it  The steak itself is small and very flavorful  I plan to eat here again when I shop at Caesars!,?
654575,Came here for lunch and had the oyster poboy as the only thing I like more than oysters are oysters that are deepfried  Perhaps this was my mistake as I havent seen it on any of the reviews and it was pretty low on the price scale ($12) but it was a huge disappointment  Poboy brings to mind an abundance of fried seafood on a bun  I understand Swan is an upscaletype diner but what arrived were 34 oysters on a bun that were bland and basically nonexistent  Ill echo other reviews that say the service was subpar as well  Basically  theres a ton of great restaurants in 2 block radius and I wouldnt bother with Swan again ,?
654589,Came here for lunch and had zero problem getting sat quickly  Considering its this close to the base that is a great feat in itself  We had quick service which is why they get 4 stars but the food is just chain BBQ nothing to write home about  Can someone explain why they let that blond worker sing to the customers  its weird  not funny and someone should make her stop!,?
655895,Came here for lunch with a friend and despite the 45 minute wait  we werent disappointed  The Las Vegas roll and the bbq eel hand roll were probably my favorite  The only downside was we found the place a little difficult to find other than that  decent ayce ,?
656555,Came here for lunch  The food is great and the service is as well  The steak burgers are pretty impressive  I only wish that the dessert browny was warmed up  The staff came over and asked us how our experience was and to help clean up  I love Freddys!,?
656632,Came here for mothers day brunch  We had reservations for 11 am  We had to wait about 15 minutes for our table  Not horrible considering how busy they were  Overall the choices for the buffet were decent  I wish there would have been a little more selection for the dessert portion as they only had carrot cake and a brownie  I cant comment on pricing as Im not sure how much it was as my step mom paid  But we all left full and satisfied  So I would say it was worth it  Because of the busyness of the morning the service was lacking a little  I never was offered a refill on my coffee ,?
657145,Came here for my birthday; awesome crowd  feel and  decor  Keeping in mind that the majority of the drinks on the menu have at least 2 oz of shots  the prices are very fair  Must order a volcano bowl for the full Shore Leavd experience!,?
657929,Came here for some brunch food  and the food is soso  The waitress we had was rude and got my order wrong  She corrected the problem  but made it seem like I didnt know what I was ordering    it was just a ham and cheese sandwich  Food is cheap  but the portion size is really small   You definitely get what you pay for  but not much more than that ,?
658174,Came here for sushi and left happy  The food was fresh and had a nice presentation  Full bar and friendly waitstaff  but almost a little too attentive  Would go back!,?
658544,Came here for the Roselle slush and I was disappointed to learn that they no longer have two small glasses for $6 99 (I dont like to drink so much in one serving) so now its one large mug I like the slush and the jelly but Im not a fan of the rose petals   I kept coughing because it tickled my throat We ordered the Strawberry and nutella crepe and it wasnt bad at $7 79 Fridays they have a special  order any crepe and get an add on for free   Tab for a crepe and two drinks was $23 and change oof ,?
659046,Came here for the first time and was recommended by a Buddy of mine  Chapo is the one I dealt with on the phone and gave me directions  He gave me a quote over the phone and stuck to it  They got me in right away and got it done quick  Highly recommended if you need exhaust work  Will definitely be coming back ,?
659568,Came here for the first time today after I did some field experience at the school nearby  Ive been by this place before but I decided to try it out today  That and I was really craving some pizza The place is a nice little shop and the man behind the counter was super nice  We actually had a conversation and I wasnt rushed away like some other places  Luckily for me  they were making a batch of cheese pizza so I was going to get the first hot slice The guy brought me my pizza and it was pretty delicious  It wasnt the best pizza in the world but it was a million times better than any pizza chain out there  If youre into atmosphere  it is very casual  A great place to have a date night or get together with some friends I probably should have got a meal deal because it would have been cheaper  Luckily there will be a next time because I really dig the pizzas theyre making  So glad I came here for a slice ,?
659842,Came here for the first time with my boyfriend last night and we were not impressed The only decent thing about it was our server  Rebekah  She was very attentive and very nice  We did find our food runner to be a tad awkward  She brought our food to the wrong table twice and each time when she realized it was our table  she just awkwardly dropped it off with no eye contact and just slithered away  It would have been nice for a smile or anything    But no  Moving along to the food  we got the Korean ribs  pull pork taco  brisket taco  collards  and wings  The Korean ribs had no flavor whatsoever  we were blown and shocked  The tacos were just okay    as were the collards  The wings were just okay too  they did have a little too much sauce on them and plus we had like only two napkins on our table   yikes Overall we probably wouldnt come back for the food but maybe for drinks later in the future This place has great potential but needs more flavor profiles in their food ,?
660176,Came here for the lamb and grilled octopus and had a great meal as usual The tzatziki dip is a standard order for us and is delicious and imho better than in the Greek isles!Service was very attentive (must have read the other reviews! lol!) And the food arrived quick Definitely worth a visit if you are craving Greek food and are in the area ,?
660503,Came here for the weekend for a wedding nearby  The night before we got there I called to see when check in was and the answer I got was that check in can be at a variety of times and that if I were to come at noon we would be fine  We checked into our hotel around 2:30 and was told our room was not ready which was going to be a problem considering we had one hour to get ready for the wedding rehearsal  We were given a different room  it was just disappointing that we had even taken the steps to call the day before and our room still was not ready  The room we did have was nice  great view of the gardens  The resort itself is huge and never felt overcrowded  The staff was always friendly and we were treated well!,?
660968,Came here half an hour before the place was opened and there was already a long line waiting  We waited for almost 2 hrs for the food because there were a lot of people bought to go for the Memorial holiday We got more than 1lb of fatty brisket and a pastramis plate came with 2 sides  The brisket was better than any brisket weve tried before  I personally like the pastrami more than the brisket  The pastrami was very moist and soft  it just melted in my mouth  We got baked beans  cole slaw and grits for sides and they were all delicious I love that they have cold water outside  shades on top  chairs and sunscreen too  They gave out some sausages samples to try and the sausages were very addictive!Is it worth 2hrs waiting? I would say yes  If I come back to Phoenix  I would go here again ,?
661564,Came here last month with another couple during happy hour   My friend and I decided we were going to take advantage of the 1/2 price appetizers and shared 4 different appetizers instead of ordering from the main menu  We shared the Sample Sliders (tuna  turkey and beef)  Zucchini Fries  Artichoke dip and Fried Shrimp  Thank goodness for the 1/2 price because I wasnt to thrilled with any of it  They were all soso and just seemed to be lacking in flavor  Our husbands ordered the Classic Burger and the Longhorn  They both got it with matchstick french fries and loved it! My husband ordered the Longhorn and it was huge!  The burger itself came with a beef patty  topped with beef brisket  onion ring  slaw and slathered with bbq sauce  I couldnt believe he ate it all  Im glad the husbands enjoyed their meals because I sure didnt  Oh well  been there  done that! I shouldve taken my cue from the name of the place and just ordered a burger  duh!,?
661948,Came here last night to see the lunar eclipse  and I really liked it! Its such a hidden gem of the city  Im a water lover so anywhere I can go and have some peace and quiet I go to the lake  It is my favourite thing to do and here its optimal for it! So quiet and private! Perfect private  intmate spot for star gazing or enjoying time outside on a nice  warm evening ,?
662812,Came here midweek expecting ultimately not much (friend suggested the place) as it is a bit outside of the way and from outside it doesnt look like much  However  once in  got treated to a very tasty ramen (as per Yelp tips  spicy red is the way to go  or the nonspicy version for nonspicy fans) and ultimately a pleasant decor (though really  the food was enough to make up for it) ,?
662948,Came here on 1/16/15 to see the men of OG for my friends bachelorette party! This place is a little raunchy if you ask me  It was fun though! Lol seeing your friends face when they realize they are getting a lap dance     Priceless! It was overall a good experience  some hotties some not so hot  Rico is the man! He was fun and knew how to dance and work for those $$$!,?
664143,Came here on a Friday night   wait was minimal  bartender was extremely friendly   waiter was attentive and knowledgeable about the menu  food was absolutely wonderful  had the french dip and it was the best Ive ever eaten ,?
664310,Came here on a Monday around 10pm with a friend  so it was pretty empty  We ordered the deep fried pork belly  mayo shrimp  the potato and chicken  butter soy ramen  and the smoky hay salmon  Pork belly and potato and chicken were soso  kind of bland  Would order the Mayo shrimp and butter soy ramen again  Smoky hay salmon the smokiness was there  however the freshness of the salmon was not  Dessert we ordered was the taro potato ice cream and the green tea cheesecake  both which we loved ,?
664381,Came here on a Monday night around 7 PM  There was about a 20 minute wait  Once we were seated the server explained how everything worked  She was in a very good mood and extremely friendly I wish I knew her name  Service was beyond fast I dont think we waited more than five minutes for our food  We got a pound of king crab legs  clams and shrimp  We only ended up getting three legs I dont think it was really worth the $31 for just the crab  though it was delicious  We also got beer and sweet potato fries  Everything ended up being about $66  Great food if youre ok with getting messy ,?
664640,Came here on a Saturday at 8 am  only a few others were there and we got to pick where we sat  Started to become more packed as time went on so we definitely made the right call getting there early  Our waitress was good enough  nothing special but checked on us multiple times and we were offered coffee refills  Our coffee and food came out pretty quickly  I got the bacon eggs Benedict and Id have to say it was probably one of the best Ive ever had    the hollandaise sauce is very good  Fairly large portions with fresh fruit as well as home fries that were good and not too greasy  Overall Id say it was above average and I would definitely consider going back during my next visit to Montreal ,?
664836,Came here on a Saturday night after dinner in ktown  which was just a short walk away  The place was fairly packed around 9pm and we got a seats at the bar  the atmosphere was great! I ordered a their cocktail special which was a punch with rum and spices and it was very good! They also have a good beer selection and drinks were reasonably prices  The place is a little small so the waitress would bump into me sometimes walking from the kitchen to the tables and there were limited number of hooks for your bag and coat but will definitely be coming back for drinks and checking out other restaurants in the area!,?
664856,Came here on a Saturday night and it had a great  lively atmosphere  The Vegan pulled pork I ordered was delicious! Overall  one of my favourite places to go with friends both vegan and nonvegan! Its hard to find places that can please both carnivorous and vegan lifestyles and this place is great  Only negative was the seating was uncomfortable and every time the front door opened we got a cold breeze ,?
665497,Came here on a Sunday for dinner with 8 friends at 6 pm   It wasnt busy when we got there and it took about 10 min just to take our drink order   The service is really slow which is very annoying   The food made it worth the wait though   The food was amazing  I would highly recommend ordering the Nori Seaweed wrapped ravioli with chicken and cheese filling  volcano roll  gyoza  and snow white roll    Bazara just needs to work on proper food execution in a timely manner ,?
665772,Came here on a Thur night it was jumping  I was not dissapointed  at all wish we could of offered bottle service  but then again I am not that big of a drinker  Overall Dj was on fire would go back for sure ,?
666272,Came here on a Wednesday night after work the interior is really dark so you cant really see the food clearly Overall experience is good as our waitress was very attentive and friendly  Food arrived pretty fast as well  We ordered a curry pork rice  beef don  Unagi sushi  ramen and an appetizer (fried chicken)  The food was average but the portions are pretty big  The Unami sushi taste good but the rice was breaking apart  As for the ramen  They have this special ramen which they only make 5 per day because it takes them ten hours to make the soup base (?)  It taste very average though Overall  its been a good experience  I would visit again  :),?
666472,Came here on a busy day everything was disorganized   Could not get anyone to take our order for about ten minutes   Should of left then    They were out of a lot of things on the menu that we wanted  Suppose to come with a free chicken entree but ran out of that also   But what really got to us was we were in the Restaurant before the other tables were and they all received their free chicken entree  we seen about seven of them flying by our table  and they never gave us ours they were being selective  And if you ask for water they get all grumpy too  and another ten minutes before you receive it after you asked two other people for it   Very disappointing  felt they were being disrespectful going back to KJ Kitchen  Adios HK,?
666697,Came here on a girls trip and absolutely looooove the service! :) next time Im visiting Ill at least have a nail place I can trust :),?
668687,Came here one Sunday morning with my boyfriend and we were amazed that we had never seen or heard of this place before  Their Bloody Mary bar was so much fun! They offer so many ingredients that allow you to get creative with your Mary  It was such a cool dinning experience  They also have amaaaaazing $5 cocktails before 5pm and the food was superb  I had the summer salad (trying to watch my figure) and every bite was surprisingly enjoyable  Probably one of the best salads Ive ever had! Cant wait to go back again ,?
669153,Came here recently on a Monday night   It wasnt packed but it wasnt empty either; this was part of the allure as we walked through NoDa deciding on a drinking establishment   Sat at one of the big family style high tables in the middle  and sampled some regional beers   The bartender was very nice and brought us out several beers for us to try before deciding  and also gave us a basket of  complimentary organic popcorn I tried to order a food item of whose name I cannot recall at this time; but I was sad to learn that the oven was broken  oh  it was a pretzel!  I couldnt have a pretzel because the oven was broken   This was sad All in all  nice vibe  laidback place with a good beer list and reasonable prices ,?
669201,Came here recommended by a friend  Used the online booking system super easy and quick  Got here on time and everything went smoothly  Ann was my lash technician and she was great  I told her about my previous mishap with having lashes that were too long that made my eyes smaller ( which I I didnt know could happen until it actually did) and she was very good at giving me suggestions about which size lash to get  Also I had told her that I didnt like my inner corners done too far in because it irritates and theyre the first ones to fall off anyway  and had to have her add more twice and she didnt complain  Im so sorry!! Haha  Would recommend coming here again  the prices are good and checked in on yelp and got a free eye brow wax as well  I always get my eyelashes done before a big event and I think Ive found my new lash place!!,?
669918,Came here this morning after seeing everyones reviews and we were not disappointed! The San Francisco Style French Toast was delicious and the biscuits and gravy should not be passed up  If you eat nothing else  try the cinnamon roll  it was to die for! Our waitress  Seta  was a bonus and she was so nice and helpful with lots of great suggestions  We loved seeing the owner doing everything from rolling silverware  refilling glasses and talking to all the customers who entered  We cannot wait to go back ,?
670430,Came here to celebrate our anniversary   We picked a table upstairs by the window which was very romantic   The food is great the ambiance was romantic   Would highly recommend the sharing platter!  Enjoyed it!,?
670633,Came here to eat lunch because we had a restaurant com voucher we needed to use  And it was during the lunch buffet so we couldnt use the voucher  We checked in to get the mango lassi so my bf and I did and then they told us we could only use one per table but they ended up giving us the second one anyway  The masala wasnt spicy at all and the karahi was okay  We didnt even eat half of the karahi  We ordered medium spicy  The older lady was our server and we couldnt understand anything and she was rude as well  She didnt even crack a smile! The older man with glasses was nice  He was the one who gave us a free mango lassi and another on the go ,?
671336,Came here to hear my daughters friends band play on a Saturday afternoon  Had no idea what to expect and I was pleasantly impressed   The atmosphere is extremely casual with sofas  tables and chairs  and high top tables Service was excellent as the cashier assisted us with our drink selection  Loved that they are local and support open mic and local bands  such a cool concept   I will definitely come back just to hang out as it was very CHILL!!,?
671625,Came here to purchase the monogram Neverfull in the MM size  They only had the GM size  The salesman didnt offer to hold one when one came in  Or try to locate one  Being a local I could have picked it up any time  I really dont Like this LV Store  I usually purchase my handbags on Rodeo Drive in Beverly Hills  The team there is really nice ,?
671697,Came here to see Hamilton this past weekend and it was extremely packed with people which was unsurprising  What was surprising was how easy and hassle free parking  lobby navigation and seat finding was despite all the people  We were able to park in the playhouse lot that connects directly to the theater and walk straight into the lobby  we were greeted with complimentary water and candy  we then were able to join the short line for photos at the Hamilton branded step and repeat  Every employee we interacted with was so friendly and helpful and I couldnt believe how fast they got people through the ticket line and into their seats  One of the red coats even ran back downstairs for my family and I after we expressed our dismay of missing the handing out of programs  She brought them to us in our seats and we were so grateful I had been to this theater years ago and this most recent experience confirms that I will continue to return in the future ,?
672000,Came here to try one of Torontos best burgers   I would really classify it as more of a steak sandwich   The burger is chopped sirloin and comes with cheese and bacon   There are no lettuce or tomatoes and the condiments offered are ketchup and hot mustard   I found the sirloin to be fatty and chewy   The bun was nice   We came mid afternoon and it was not very busy but service was not very attentive   Fries were great and we had the sticky toffee pudding which was delicious   The upper patio is really nice ,?
672064,Came here to try something new in the sunset area   Nothing was wrong with the place  but it was mediocre food  fine service  it was busy   I found it by reviews  Ive had better gyros   I wouldnt come again ,?
672437,Came here to watch the new Monsters Inc University movie with the family   Theatre is what you expect  gigantic screen and excellent sound   Movie pricing seems to be quite expensive these days but hey   entertainment sure is a premium!!,?
672857,Came here today to buy a new bra  Did not end up getting one thanks to the despicable condescending wretch who was working the fitting room  This woman should not have a job working with people ,?
672952,Came here today with a large group of 9 and expected to wait a bit to get a table  I was pleasantly surprised the wait was less then 5 minutes before we were seated  Our waitress was a bit too efficient as she quickly gave us menus and brought us menus  Less then a few minutes after handing us the menus she asked if we were ready to order  Considering the menu was quite extensive  a few in our party needed more time before ordering  She hovered til people ordered which bothered me a little  I settled on getting the lunch special half sandwich  salad and soup combo  I decided on the chicken salad sandwich  mushroom barley soup  The sandwich was very delicious but the wedge of lettuce in it was a bit overkill  The salad was a vinaigrette and was really good  The mushroom barley soup was a bit salty for my taste  What I also liked was at the end when we got the bill that gratuity was not already included (like most other places),?
673058,Came here tonight and ordered:1) Son in law eggs  Delicious! I love eggs in general and it was a perfect one bite snack! It was hard to savour every flavour b/c it was just one bite but it was delicious! 2) Chicken Wings  Pretty good wings! The flavours were very typically asian   a little sweet  salty and a tiny bit spicy   3) Ribs  The ribs were pretty good as well   The meat wasnt fall off the bone but it was quite moist   We thought the ribs were the same sauce as the chicken wings with some plum sauce added to make it to make it more sweet   4) Rendang Curry  This dish was our most disappointing dish   It came with coconut rice which was delicious but the curry was so sour   All I could taste was sour  to the point where I couldnt finish it   Overall  we spent about $50 and felt quite full   We would come back but probably only for the son in law eggs ,?
673346,Came here twice and I have to say that it is such a lovely spot for lunch or dinner  What I like the most is probably the decor  Its spacious and well lit and has this nice but casual feel to it (if that makes any sense)  Came here with one of my friend who is hmm a picky eater and she even really liked this place  The pizzas and the salads are delicious  The pizza size is great for one person who is hungry or enough to share with a salad or appetizer  One of my friend had the watermelon cocktail and its the perfect summer drink: lightly sweetened and refreshing  Have not tried their roast chicken yet but will come back for more ,?
673358,Came here twice and both times there were no lettuce for the salad and no way to substitute for other ingredients  Terrible ,?
673474,Came here twice for lunch and both times left pretty impressed  Although their portions are small  Pick Thai has a nice lunch menu with delicious curries and stir fries  Their desserts are also on point  but the best thing on the menu? Hands down  its their mango salad  I could just eat 28 bowls of that stuff on its own  So flavorful and packed with amazingness  Id give the restaurant all the stars I could just for the salad  But alas  it only comes in a small portion and is gone before you know it! Docked a star for their smaller portions but totally delicious place that Id love to check out for dinner one day!,?
673910,Came here w/my kids(their choice) the place is pretty cool  Bar  jukebox  pool table and good grub! My kids ordered a ginger ale & a blueberry My daughter ordered a veggie burger w/sweet potato fries  I tasted the fries and I liked the cinnamon that was on the sweet potato fries  I ordered a hangover burger to go  so I guess I would review that after I eat it@home lol for a Friday night it wasnt busy nor crowded which I liked  And like I said earlier  its s pretty cool sports bar  Thank u! Well b back smooches!,?
674427,Came here with Husband and a huge group of friends a few months back  Hot pot was not all that great  and the soup choices were limited  It was nice that they had split dividers so that if you had one half spicy and the other half not  youd be able to choose The quality of meats were okay  but a bit too fatty for my liking  Most of their other offerings were processed fish and meat balls with imitation crab  Pretty standard hot pot choices  and even still  on the lower grade of quality For a price of close to $2530 CAD/head for AYCE  I expected a little more  Understandable that since its in Downtown core near Eaton Centre and price will be naturally higher  but wish theyd either reduce the number of item choices and bump up the quality  or go all out and offer a lot more overall Its a fun place to go with friends and socialize  but if youre there for the food only  Id definitely pass ,?
675655,Came here with a group of 5  Waited a little over an hour for our food that was delivered by a rude food runner  Then waited another 45 minutes for the check  The waitress said it was busy Id hate to see this place actually busy ,?
676328,Came here with a small group  Everything was good to great  The steamed pork buns were delicious as was the beef shumi  Barbacoa taco was yummy  friend didnt think the BBQ taco was just ok though  Would definitely come back next time were in town!,?
676421,Came here with coworkers for lunch and I had the beef tips with a side of rice and onion rings   Food was uninspiring  service was average  and the place was eclectic   That said  the prices were pretty good considering the portion   It definitely has that home feel  but not my home  maybe your home The place doesnt really stand out and I would find it hard to come back to this place because nothing is really spectacular or idiosyncratic about it   The best part is that its like a 5 block walk from where I work so I get to get in a nice brisk walk over here because the food comes out a little on the slow side dmo out ,?
676635,Came here with friends for Summerlicious this year  the food was pretty good for summerlicious menu (good portion sizes and pretty tasty)  However the service was not on par our server was rude and did not smile to us nor try to make conversation  For a restaurant that calls themself a french bistro  we expected the service to be top notch too  Train your servers please!,?
676957,Came here with my Portugalphile parents this evening Reasonably priced  you get legit Portuguese food Service was superb  attentive and quick to meet our requests When the parental unit meet someone from Portugal  they get really  really  really excited  Our poor server    however  he entertained them and they seemed content to talk about their favorite country Food was delish I had the chicken with wine and mushrooms smothered on it  Simple  but awesome Ill be back ,?
677007,Came here with my besties during my bachelorette weekend! Solid food and better yet    amazing margaritas on the rocks and $3 Coronas on a holiday weekend! Fajitas were on point as was the gaucamole  veggie burrito and shrimp tacos  Yum  Victor was the best,?
678163,Came here with my husband for a facial each  using an online deal we had previously purchased   It was our first time here and we were pleasantly surprised by how friendly  warm and professional the staff were   The location is incredibly beautiful as previously described by other yelpers  I think yoga is their main focus  as we were brought downstairs into the basement where a small area is for spa experiences We both thought our facials were fantastic   Having been around the city a few times  we both thought the facialist at 889 yonge is one of the best we have had   Wonderful technique  incredibly serene and tranquil environment for the facial   Highly recommend   I will likely come by and try out their yoga classes   I believe they have a great first month of yoga promo or something of the like ,?
678698,Came here with my wife on a Wednesday night and the place was relatively busy  We have gone to this place a few times in the past  We were promptly seated and given a cup of green tea We ordered the Chirashi and Nabe Seafood Udon  The prices at this restaurant are probably a bit above average given the quality  The fish in the Chirashi was good and the portion size was decent  The udon was definitely below average  and I was quite disappointed in the seafood and also the presentation Service is quite slow  which may be due to being understaffed  It took a good 10 minutes to get our bill  Given the number of sushi restaurants in Markham  this one will probably fall down a few spots on the list of ones that I will go to ,?
680059,Came home to a clogged toilet  sink  and bathtub tonight and called a plumber only to be told the job was too much for them to handle and to contact a drain cleaner instead  Called Discount Drain Cleaning after seeing great reviews online and could not be happier with the service we received!  Walter arrived at our house within an hour of my call and was able to get the problem (actually 2 problems) fixed for us  Total lifesaver as we have company arriving from out of state tomorrow and our guest bathroom was completely useless!  Thank you so much!!!  I will definitely recommended your services to friends and neighbors!,?
680455,Came in after a movie    No line up considered the shawarma place close by is packed  The place is not busy at all  Service was alright  Portion size was decent  Price was reasonable  I would come by again if I am craving for Greek and want something fast ,?
681820,Came in for a TBall registration event  They also had another fundraiser and ice cream eating contest  We decided to stay for some pizza and games  they have a deal pizza and tokens $25  Place was very busy  Ordered pizza  went and played some game while we waited  you get a buzzer to let you know when the pizza it ready  Game area was filled with kids  it was clean and I did like that the attendants were watching over  Pizza was up pretty fast   The pizza was hot and looked good a little skimpy on the toppings  Pizza was tasty  Played some more games  cashed tickets in  and got prizes  The ticket counter was broken  so the line was pretty long to cash in   Eating area  game area and bathrooms were very clean ,?
681897,Came in for a check up for my niece and customer rep was arguing on the phone with another customer and when it was my nieces turn the negative vibe was passed on to us  Not a good morning at all ,?
682090,Came in for a late breakfast and I dont have many complaints  We tried one of their juices from their juice bar which had an interesting flavor to it  Overall the food was pretty good  It wasnt anything over the top but it was good  Since they say they are good for brunch I wish they would serve mimosas or bloody marys  Either way everything was good and you can tell that the fruit and vegetables are very fresh  Gotta love the fresh produce!,?
682469,Came in for a quick shake and the register girls were totally mean and not customer friendly  Honest will never come here again ,?
682558,Came in for a table for two knowing the other party would be delayed  Waited for 15 minutes without anyone even approaching to offer a water  a drink or appetizers  Keep in mind the restaurant was only a third full    disappointedMight as well run around the corner to any other restaurant on spring mountain,?
682664,Came in for an estimate and the team reviewed my vehicle and HONESTLY told me that work doesnt need to be done  Sure they wanted my business but earned my respect and any future business I may need ,?
683139,Came in for fathers day   first timers   Great service and food   Ordered the French toast with vanilla ice cream ,?
683307,Came in for lunch and had the fig burger     amazingly delicious burger   Super juicy and great taste!!,?
683981,Came in for the 35pm happy hour of 20% off as listen on their sign  But when ordering I find out its only certain items even if I wanted to purchase more expensive items  And they were out of most Japanese beers  Notsohappy hour ,?
684398,Came in from out of town needing a shave got one of the best shaves Ive ever had   The stylist was from out of town but she did a great job  Highly recommend this place,?
684639,Came in here for a brake job  Right away Cole in labor explained the costs and expected time to complete my job  By the end of the inspection they found a couple other problems and he worked with me on the price and also gave me a 10% discount for be a veteran  Good service and quality work  What more can yah ask for from an auto repair joint ,?
685321,Came in hoping to try the Assorted or Bossam HanPan as pictured on some Yelp reviews  was really disappointed when we found out the menu changed and those items had been removed  We ended up getting the pork feet HanPan  the hamburger steaks and a dumpling stew  All ended up being great  the pork feet HanPan was really good  especially the pork feet (especially since I am normally someone who does not eat pork feet) and the potato croquets  The hamburger steak was also great  Dumpling stew was pretty usual  but the stew has a bit more of a fatty beef and msg flavour so may not be for everyone ,?
686118,Came in on a Monday night with guest from out of town  The alcohol was good but thats pretty much it  The server got our order wrong and the tacos that came out had old/brown avocados on top  If youre going to charge me $4 a taco  at least have a fresh green slice of avocado and not a brown/ black slice   Disappointing visit   ,?
686761,Came in on opening day  but after the rush cleared 3pm ish  The tacos were good  Tried the fish Baja style and the chicken tacos with Spanish rice and black beans  Not bad  The service was great  Gonna have to come back and try something else on the menu ,?
686834,Came in over the weekend for a quick dinner   Had a buy one get one free coupon  Pizza was ok but nothing great  The vibe of the place was a little off like staff wasnt really sure they wanted to be there  Good for a quick lunch at a decent price point ,?
687191,Came in to Shake Shack after being ignored completely at Firebirds with my girlfriend Ordered a smoke shack single with a cookies and cream milkshake  Food came out relatively quickly after sitting down  First time at a shake shack and it was great  I can tell the ingredients were quality and fresh  Better than Burger Fi Highly recommended if havent tried ,?
688822,Came in with a few friends  have never been here before  Hard to spot at night from the street because the sign doesnt light up and the parking lot is dark  Super chill spot  plenty of seating both inside and out  Decent prices  good portions and a nice selection of ice cream/toppings  I love their name and logo  the penguin is awesome so I definitely had to leave with a coffee cup (way to upsell me!)  I commented on how slow it seemed when we got there  within five minutes there was a line out the door  Awesome little spot in the heart of South Scottsdale that didnt disappoint!,?
689190,Came in with my family  a party of 7   This is my first time here  The food was great  I had the Pancake Sandwich   The kids had the Kids Chocolate Chip Pancakes    which had to be a mistake as there were 3 huge pancakes with chocolate chips for $2   Folks and sister had the Chicken Parm   it had a nice presentation   but tasted flat   It needed a lot of salt and parmesan cheese   Brother in law had the Sausage Skillet   The portions are generous   The coffee is outstandingThe service is somewhat unconventional and there appears to be a lack of must be adhered to standards that you get at corporate restaurants    Service wasnt great   but it certainly did not suck   With a little work by someone who knows the business  this easily could be a 4 or 5 star family diner ,?
690302,Came on Tuesday to chill on my birthday to do some hookah and maybe dance but it turned out to be a Comedy Night  We didnt expect that at all  The comedians were mediocre  Very few laughs  The Hookah was decent though ,?
690362,Came on a Friday night at 530pm and it wasnt too busy  They were offering a deal on their AYCE dinner price  Rather than $25 99  it was $22 99 and for an extra 6 bucks  youll get EVERYTHING on the menu!!! The salt and pepper crab was delicious!! The sushi here was fresh  and theyre little hot snacks were good! Servers were very attentive and friendly! Would definitely would back!,?
690443,Came on a Monday night with a party of six   The parking lot is tiny!!!! Theres only about 810 spots reserved for this restaurant  everything else is for the hotel and the bank in the area   The outside of the restaurant looks beautiful but the inside was very average Food is expensive!!!! A peking duck is $118  included 24 wraps  6 mini sesame buns  individual dipping sauce and scallion  and a plate of cucumbers   Duck was average at best   The rest of the food is also very expensive  Between the six of us  or bill was almost $300 after tax and the food wasnt very good  Service was fast and efficient as they had tons of servers  food runners and managers   They spoke English  Cantonese and Mandarin The two stars I gave was for service and the exterior of the restaurant To end  below average food  extremely overpriced  good service ,?
690484,Came on a Saturday afternoon  Found metered parking right out front  Jasmine pearl tea was deliciousyou can watch them create it from the hand rolled pearls! :)Clean  calming decor  Friendly  courteous staff  Definitely worth a visit if youre downtown!,?
690671,Came on a Sunday around 3pm and there was no wait and very few people inside  For starters  we got the fried pickles which were the BEST fried pickles I have ever had  Honestly  I would go back just to get fried pickles and going to this restaurant is quite the drive for me  It was the perfect amount of crispy and the ranch was amazing!! I got the chicken and waffles as the main dish with hash browns  The portions were huge and the butter was the best part! The hash browns were a little too crispy for me but the chicken and waffles were good! The chicken could have been seasoned a little more but Im still a fan! I would definitely go back because I heard the grits were really good and of course for the pickles ,?
690681,Came on a Sunday at 9am right when they open and it was empty  Even by the time we left about an hour later  there were plenty of open tables They give a 13% cash discount The omassa was probably my favorite dish here  The texture was perfect  Its pretty hard to get the texture right  and this was probably the best one Ive ever had The shrimp rice roll was too chewy and not enjoyable  Dont get the turnip cake  it was very rubbery  The egg yolk bun was super hard on outside and the inside wasnt runny The other dishes were all very average  I wouldnt make a special trek to come back ,?
691273,Came out from california to check this place out  Let me say it was so delicious! I had the unagi  nigari salmon  Dynamite roll  and rainbow roll  It was all to die for  The service from the staff wasnt so great which is why im giving it four stars  but I must say the owner Juno is awesome! He came to our table and introduced himself to us and told us how theyve only been here for 1 1/2 year  He was very nice and kind  I will definitely come back ,?
691622,Came recently with a small group  The food was fine  with lots of vegetables and nice plating  but they messed up my order twice  which I think is ridiculous for the price  Also  Im pretty sure the whipped cream on our dessert was actually one of those oil products     it just tasted too artificial  While the decor is dated  the view is still amazing  Maybe  a better place to just grab an appetizer and a drink than a full meal ,?
691828,Came thru the drive thru and was greeted by two barristas eager to help  Best customer service at a Starbucks Ive ever had! In and out in a jiffy too!,?
692149,Came to Dennys because I love their food  However  this location was absolutely awful  We went in for dinner ON MOTHERS DAY  and we waited in the lobby for 10 minutes  The restaurant was completely empty with only one table occupied  The 2 servers were busy with their own shit and did not even acknowledge us  They saw us  but turned and continued with whatever they were doing  They didnt say a single word to us  We waited and waited in hopes that they would at least let us know theyd be with us shortly  however that did not happen  To the manager of this particular establishment  do your business a favor and change your staff  Im so disgusted that my moms special day was ruined because of the apathetic service from the staff ,?
693091,Came to Vegas for the weekend and tried this place thanks to Yelp! It was delicious  affordable  and healthy  The chef even came out to check in with us to make sure everything was ok  Highly recommended!,?
693908,Came to my house  Gave a reasonable quote  Then after 3 phone calls  4 txts  and 5 days later of no responce    I decided that any company that does not care to return to a call cant possibly be worth my money  #fatandhappy,?
693967,Came to pick up some food today  Immediately the guy had some attitude  I kindly ask for extra napkins and was told that theres already napkins with the utensils  You know  that one small napkin that comes in those small packets with forks and knives  Anyway  the guy starts serving other guests behind me  handing food to them across my face  Very unprofessional  I wasnt even done signing the check  Handed about three  people their food across my face as I was getting my food and signing the check  Food will be cold from this place because hot and cold items are kept in the same plastic containers ,?
694354,Came to the mall for this place because they have the best food! Great spot very clean and professional!,?
695898,Came upon this place by chance and so happy we did!  Great coffee  great service!  Loved the little chocolate covered coffee bean that was on the lid of my coffee when they handed it to me  I hope that comes w/ every drink  super cute & yummy!  The orangecranberry muffin top was delish  My only suggestion would be to take them from the fridge earlier so they are room temp otherwise  cant wait to go back!,?
696383,Came with high expectations because of friends recommendations but dissapointed to find out that food here was not authentic Vietnamese  The grilled pork with noodle (bun thit nuong) I had was mediocre and tasted unappetizingly strong due to too much 5 spice powder  My friend ordered Pho  the broth was good but nothing mind blowing  Wont be back anytime soon since its quite out of my daily routes To their credit  the place is quite nice and clean compared to your typically shaddy Vietnamese restaurants ,?
696672,Came with the fam  Started with the beer sampler  Wow   the premium red  beer was actually really good and rarely say that about beer to be honest  Also rare for me to compliment a steak house but I would definitely recommend here  Decent steaks  great ambiance  and atmosphere with open kitchen and not overwhelming beef aroma  However I did notice some servers could smile more but they gradually brightened up as the night went on  Had the prime rib and it was decent  Usually that is the best to any steak house but the rib eye was amazing  Maybe just got lucky on that cut but most of it melted in your mouth  Decent portions and good pricing  We also had the guacamole as a starter  Some enjoyed it but I thought it sub par compared to others Ive had  Like what all others are saying get the shoe string Fries  Ill up this to a 5 star if I go next time and get the same great experience   (hopefully some more smiles from the waitress tho :),?
696705,Came with three colleagues from work and we all walked away very impressed   The staff was very friendly and helpful and the food tasted fresh and delicious   Had the spring rolls which tasted hand rolled  along with some kimchi fried rice  and spicy tom yum soup with steak   We all agreed that this has now joined the regular rotation ,?
698412,Can I say it again?  Wow!  The atmosphere is wonderful and the lasagna was unreal  Easily  the best Ive ever eaten  If you are going on a first date  want a romantic place to dine  or just want good food  this is the place! Period ,?
698549,Can Pittsburgh get a new iconic food item please?  I come here once in a blue moon to introduce an unsuspecting visitor to this regional specialty  aka soggy bread with limp fries and wilted lettuce   Bland and mushy and messy   Given that they proudly sell Primanti tshirts at the airport  I guess this place wont be going away any time soon ,?
698686,Can be a little intimidating for the nonrockenthusiast  but boasts a friendly  knowledgeable staff and an array of unusual gifts: seashell bracelets  amber earrings  uncut chunks of amethyst Also a great place to run into angry exgirlfriends of burnout exboyfriends  much to your chagrin ,?
699887,Can you give zero stars?  The driver  John  who claims to be the owner (and is 60  as he told us several times for some reason)  was incredibly rude and angry the entire time we were on the bus   He threatened to leave us in the desert to be eaten by coyotes (no lie  he actually threatened to do that)    Is definitely in the WRONG LINE OF WORK   Should never be in a people facing position   This was not a rowdy group at all!!!,?
701269,Cant believe Ive never written a review for Lux  I guess its because words cant even begin to explain this sweet little gem in the heart of Phoenix  Its an experience from the moment you open the door  Their staff ranks #1 on my list for best service from an establishment in the valley   Best way to put it: We travel here EVERYDAY from Scottsdale JUST to get coffee! TRY EVERYTHING!,?
701283,Cant believe Vegas has some of the best tacos Ive ever tasted  and Im from Texas  Recommend to try this place out if your from out of town,?
701924,Cant decide if you want Asian or barbecue?  This is a good place for you!  They have a nice assortment of appetizers and sides for both the Asian and barbecue parts of the menu  and the same for the entrees   They also have a nice selection of beers and the Las Vegas staple of the frozen cocktail drinks   Prices are reasonable  but if you are looking cheap eats  youre in the Strip  youre in the wrong place!,?
702389,Cant get much better for comfort food  Great stuff  super tasty  Loved the place  Definitely check it out if youre feeling like stuffing your stomach ,?
703199,Cant keep things in stock like Spinach and ask for broccoli and the produce guy never heard of it ,?
703488,Cant really say anything bad about this place   Sure its not the cleanest or most updated Vietnamese restaurant in the area  but the service and quality makes up for it   It is run by a very pleasant couple  with the husband doing most of the waiting Granted  Ive had the beef noodle soup just about every time Ive been here  but its pretty good   Their broth has a distinct flavour to it   The fatty beef and tendon they use  I find is better than others   The noodles are also authentic in texture   We did try the bun once and it was average Theres a good selection of viet food around this area  but I find I keep coming back to Bach Yen ,?
703647,Cant remember when we have laughed so much! This was one of the best shows I have ever seen  Came to Vegas to celebrate turning 50 this year and this show was a must  Cant recommend this show enough!!!,?
704612,Cant say enough good things about this place  Weve used them for a few years now and have been nothing but pleased with the care of our dog  Whether its for day care or boardingIve always had a great experience ,?
704939,Cant say much that hasnt been said before  A Scarborough classic best bang for your buck when it comes to quick eats  Gives any burger a run for its money ,?
706062,Candice was great!  The food we had was ok banana nut muffin good  Good casual place to visit  ,?
706706,Cannot say enough about this place! The food was amazing  service impeccable and the ambience over the top for mood  Left the Bellagio for this nondescript hotel that contains this gem! The meat was extraordinary and melt in your mouth delicious  The brussels sprouts with bacon were beyond with giant chunks of flavorful meat  Potatoes with truffles and Parmesan so creamy and melt in your mouth goodness!  Martinis above par  Everything in this place was the best  Weve been to many a steakhouse this may be above all of them  Not to mention the intimate environment and personal touch they put on it  You must go to this place so it thrives! Would come back to town just for this!!!,?
706761,Cannot say enough good things about them   They fixed a botched install from the now out of business Ultimate Electronics   Jon took a lot of time away from other work to sit down and really explain my options   They also stand by their work and helped me when I had a hardware failure nearly a year after the install   At no cost for the labor they swapped out the faulty component instead of making me wait for the manufacturer to repair it so I didnt have to spend any time without my audio and Bluetooth   If you go to most shops they will not take the time to explain the products (or the salespeople dont understand the products) but thats not true at Handcrafted Car Audio   The only problem is I want to spend more money there than I can afford!,?
707249,Cant thank Chris enough   Ive come in with all sorts of strange and random phone issues  as well as the basics (cracked screen  bad charger port  etc) and he has always been helpful  kind  courteous  and affordable Weve figured out why my Android wasnt writing to SD card as well as replaced my wifes iPhone screen countless times I dont bother going anywhere else with a phone problem ,?
707566,Capital grille gave me half bitten stake for my dinner  Im so disgusted  Worst place every,?
707685,Cappuccino was pure and not sweet or creamy that makes you fat   I can tell that the coffee was made with great care  The cashier asked how many shots I wanted and another specific server was making the coffee: nice and delicate little tools  skilful yet passionate handling of everything  and served your coffee with courtesy  The 3floor traditional style brick building added more beauty to this place  Overall a nice place to visit ,?
707687,Cappuccino was terrible  Vegetarian Sandwich was just a couple roasted veggies with nothing else  pretty bland  Plus they offer to warm it up but it has lettuce so it was all yucky an wilted ,?
708741,Carefully prepared Asian fusion cuisine made with high quality ingredients  Service was attentive without being annoying  Interesting cocktail selections with premium spirits and fresh squeezed juices and house made syrups  I loved the seasonal sangria ,?
709306,Carlos and his partner Santos are two of the most professional  friendliest people around and their team does an excellent job  They always ask for feedback on their job to make sure its to your standards  and are licensed  bonded  and insured so you can have a peace of mind knowing that theyre professionals and you are in Good hands ,?
709439,Carlos  the manager was always friendly came in one day  we use to come in the village pub rainbow quite often btw  Carlos was so rude when he took our order  when he asked if we needed anything else  I said a smile  he smiled  that was the last time he ever acknowledged my family  Carlos totally ignores us every time we are in the pub  and has gone out of his way to make sure he is no where near us  Rude Asshole we have been coming in this restaurant longer than hes been employed with Ellis Island Doesnt make it homey when hes here at all  you picked the wrong guy for a home cooked experience  We use to come here a lot  now its maybe a couple times a month maybe  The food and other employees are awesome unfortunately  due to Carlos attitude we no longer recommend The Village Pub Rainbow  If Carlos gets hungry  he should eat that chip on his shoulder ,?
709648,Carmen has been here 35 years  so obviously shes doing something right!  This is true NM style food  sooooo good!  A long time valley favorite of mine  cant go wrong here!  Definitely in my top ten valley wide Mexican food options!  Anything on the menu is good!  Excellent tamales  enchiladas    Red or green  its all good    ,?
709816,Carne Asada Carne Asada Carne Asada!!!they have street corn the salsas are on point and have lots of flavor! come try it!The nachos  tacos  churros and agua frescas are fantastic  The employees are all so nice and welcoming Inside the place is always very clean and updated ,?
709999,Carne asada is cooked well  My only complaint is the spice level of the salsa they put on and the $13 cost of carne asada fries  But I guess this is Vegas right ,?
710075,Carnegie Coffee Company is my spot! I love it there  They have refurbished the old post office  Comfortable seating  decent WiFi and great coffee and tea  Love it!  I have also tried a variety of their assorted pastries  Delicious  They also do sandwiches  salads  and have a soup of the day  They turkey sandwich on a croissant is beyond amazing  Fresh ingredients and prepared quickly I love it  Service is ALWAYS friendly and efficient  It can get quite busy and the comfortable seating can be a hard to come by  but there isnt a bad seat in the house  They also have a great upstairs  I like to come and work here on the weekends  Definitely stop by and enjoy a cup of delicious coffee ,?
710765,Carrabbas is a very good Italian restaurant  The last time we wanted to go though  we ended up leaving It was really busy for a Monday night surprisingly  and the wait time was like 40 minutes for a party of 2  Next time we want to come  well make a reservation The food is good though  and so is the waiter service  The hostess was rude the last time we came in  I would go back ,?
710940,Carrot Top show is the best show on the Strip! Better than even the old Sigfreid and Roy and Circ de Solei   I didnt stop laughing for one minute  seriously  Every minute is like  if you live in Vegas like me  an epiphany! Or even stayed here as a tourist   If you can do one show here  this is the one! He makes it worthwhile for you  idk but he does put his whole heart and soul in his show  bless his heart! A must see    ,?
711932,Cash only! So visit the ATM before going    Friendly staff  great bagels  and a nice selection of cream cheese  No line at around 8pm on a Tuesday night (but you may have to fight your way through the line queued up for the ice cream place a few doors down    its probably some absurdly famous place Ive never heard of  but WOW was it packed  and I assume that Fairmount is equally packed at around 8am)  I took four bagels to go  two onion  two plain (but was wishing Id gone for the garlic when I saw them through the little window)  We went with the onion this morning  super fresh  not at all as dense/chewy as bagels in the US typically are  and very tasty  Yup  this is another place Id surely come back to if I lived in Montreal  Enjoy!,?
712041,Cash only  Pretty loud inside  but chill enough outside to sit and chat  Great vibe  twinkly lights and bench/tables outside  Drinks are pretty average ,?
712643,Cassandra has been my hair stylist for a long time   I had an intention to be blonde without destroying my hair for quite sometime now and she got me there   She tailored a custom toner for me that gave me a beautiful sandy beige blonde   She is very sweet and knowledgable   I highly recommend her for a cute cut/color   I had a hard time finding my goto hair stylist and Im happy I found her !,?
713111,Casual place with great food! Youll love it here ,?
713417,Catered our daughters wedding  could not have asked for better!  Staff was amazing  setup was beautiful  food was delicious and plenty of it!,?
713700,Caught Brad repeating the same joke about 2 weeks ago his black friend was in town and called him accidentally with his penis   He said this joke in 2016 and then again last night    so disappointing   I really thought it happened  I was duped,?
713806,Caught this place at the end of their day  Nice atmosphere and a good feel allround  The music may have been a little loud considering the place was empty but 90s hip hop is so classic it kind of worked  Tried a few rolls including the Dancing Queen specialty roll  This restaurant is on their sushi game for sure and the rolls were excellent  In all this was a very good experience and would be four stars  but reaches five stars because the service was outstanding,?
713834,Caught up with two amazing girl friends here and had such a great time  Everything from the food to the service to the atmosphere was perfect  We split a series of dishes (5 or 6 I think)  which were all fantastic  My personal favs included the curried octopus  dumplings  sweet bread buns and oysters (tip ask for the hot sauce with the oysters  amazing!)  I would go back in a heart beat! The only downside is it comes at a price  but it is certainly worth it for a nice night out with friends  I cant wait to go back!,?
713851,Cauliflower steaks were amazing and the staff was happy to accommodate our vegan requests  Fantastic cocktails and a charming space  Look forward to trying again!,?
713852,Cauliflower tacos and potato tacos were superb :D Great service and strong drinks,?
714973,Celebrated my Birthday at Mix in Style as a Mandalay Casino VIP Guest  Lets just say it was everything I expected  decadent  trendy and a first class experience   The wine selection was first class and I selected a fine french wine that knocked our socks off  pricey but worth it for serious business or a special occasion  Or   if you just won the powerball  great place to spend some time ,?
716653,Cesare is truly a class act   When it comes to picking a photographer  I look for someone whos a perfectionist and loves what they do   Cesare is just that   He takes the time to do a full consultation and cater the session to highlight your best features   Hes passionate about helping his clients succeed  and generous with his referrals    Whether working for a celebrity  family  or charity  his work is consistent   Thanks for creating my first zed card  Cesare    I look forward to working with you in the future! :o),?
716894,Cha Cha is my nail girl and she is awesome! Shes been doing my gel manicures and pedicures at such a great price! Her work is amazing! I recommend her!,?
716974,Chad always does an incredible job with my color and cut at a reasonable price  I used to dye my own hair because it always cost so much and would not be what I wanted at the endhe listens  not afraid to be artistic  professional and never cuts too much  He is picky to perfection on creating exactly what you are hoping for  I am never going back to self jobs again!,?
717032,Chad grooms my 3 dogs  one which is a special needs golden retriever who cannot walk   He always takes great care with my furry ones and does a spectacular job  Making an appointment with Chad is very easy and he always lets me know when hes on the way  You and your pets will love him ,?
717918,Change in ownership   now Vietnamese   is reflected in the product   A salty  not tasteless mess topping with a soggy unattachable crust  Friendly people An overall definite deterioration    Try Vesuvios,?
718295,Chantal was so good and such a pleasure to work with! Fun fun fun and great   She did exactly what I wanted and I looked very natural but glowing! Thank you Chantal!!! We come to Vegas about once a year and I will always call her for a special night on the town!,?
719494,Charlotte Car Transport has shipped my car over the past 2 summers  I always promise Alvaro a good review but I always forget  I just set up pick up estimate with them for my 2014 E350 they always take care of my car and give me a reasonable price  5 stars because they havent given me reason to think otherwise,?
719866,Charming French bakery in Old Montreal  Beautiful arrangement of pastries  The croissant was a bit too sweet and overcooked for my liking  However  the desert fruit/ citrus tarte was incredible  Kind of pricey  but the quality of the desert stuff is very good  Good service ,?
719883,Charming and beautiful cafe! If I lived closer  Id be here more frequently! Tasty coffee and friendly owners  Love the massive patio filled with lush greenery  Would return to hang out on a lovely  cool  Arizona day!,?
720012,Charming little neighborhood coffee shop with friendly service  tasty food and great prices    Forget about the coffee chains and support unique  small businesses like Nostalgia!  Will definitely be back!,?
721820,Cheap food that tastes good  Cant beat that  I always go through the drive through and never have to wait long  Orders are usually (but not always) complete when presented  There have been times when an item or two didnt make it in the bag   Still  the cost of the food is so minute that you cant get mad   They have pretty awesome milkshakes  too!,?
722216,Cheap prices for what you are getting! I got the curry udon which was filling  but I think a little lacking in flavor  I recommend the tofu nuggets as an appetizer  Nice little restaurant for being in a food court ,?
722288,Cheap quality nail polish needed more than 45 minutes to dry  Got ruined on my way home  Shellac colour was translucent on my nails  Will never return ,?
722296,Cheap rate  clean room  but super thin walls   You can hear everything  everywhere  Housekeeping starts early    Tub needed resurfacing and breakfast area is sparse and somewhat dirty   Front desk clerk was mostly outside smoking,?
723113,Cheaper and better than Starbucks  Fanfreakingtastic iced coffee! High quality black coffee in my iced coffee  Didnt even use sugar and milk  Naturally sweet with a hint of normal coffee bitterness Soft and moist peanut butter cookies cant be beat  $2 50 a giant cookie??? What! So glad we found this little gem tucked into NY NY! Made our last afternoon in Vegas better than it would have been  Plenty of tables close by to people watch while you beat the heat of the strip  Max AC was so refreshing I had to but my cardigan on  Love!!,?
723313,Cheapest place around during happy hour! You must check it out  Try the volcano drink for two!,?
723743,Check in was fairly quick and the gal who helped us was friendly and helpful  We had a remodeled room in the Masquerade Tower too bad they dont put new mattresses in these rooms! The bed had a huge dip in it   Also  this hotel is off strip  if you want the hustle and bustle then stay somewhere else  And finally  what hotel doesnt let you have a late checkout if you ask for it?? Not this one:( I wont be back!,?
724916,Checked in quickly  nice front desk folks  Dr  was quick to see me on time  xray tech and equipment on site which is convenient  Overall good visit ,?
725503,Checked out the rooftop bar last night  It was like a little oasis with a bunch of activity in the middle of a quiet shopping center  There was a line singing guitar player with a nice set list of rock and 80s music  Service was very good and attentive and they dont rush you  The calamari appetizer was good with the sauce as the best part  Not your usual calamari so a nice change  I went with the shrimp and scallops with grits  It was dark by the time I was eating it and I havent even examined the pic I took so I am guessing it looked great  It was tasty  I loved the creamy grits  Not soupy  just perfect  Not a whole lot of scallops from what I can tell but overall I like the dish  The crowd was a mix of single minglers around the bar and coupes and groups having dinner  There is also downstairs outside seating if you want to be outside and still hear the music but not hear all the bar noise ,?
726217,Checked this place out with a friend  He had a burrito and a couple of tacos  while I just had tacos His burrito was fairly small  Looked like it needed more filling to tortilla ratio  The tacos were good  Their homemade chorizo was tasty  and Id definitely recommend the al pastor  I also had barbacoa and smoked pork  Nothing really special about either  I always love a good salsa bar but instead of having containers handy for the customer to grab they would just hand you a couple  I love to be able to try all the salsas a place makes but dont want to have to deal with them being stingy with the containers   Would I eat here again? Sure  but I wouldnt go out of my way to get it ,?
726346,Checking in a little late  This place was great   Great atmosphere  amazing service  legit menu  Our waitress described the food as American comfort food and we were not disappointed  They have everything from salads to chicken and biscuits  Burger and wings were delicious   I would most definitely return ,?
726828,Cheese curds?  Outstanding!  Old school ambiance?  Check!  Brew quality?  Fab!  Pub burger?  OMG!!!  Nom nom   Definitely a good spot to experience Madison vibe and famous fried cheese curds   Dont miss it!,?
727398,Chef Chris Colemans menu is fun  quirky  inventive & delicious  And he loves beets and simple veggies as much as I do! A must try when youre in Charlotte  Wonderful service; youll feel like youre having dinner with old friends!,?
727426,Chef Daniel has left and everything good about this place went with him  The macaroni not only had too much cheese but wasnt cooked enough even to be al dente  The French fries were a bit raw  the chicken and mashed potatoes both had absolutely no seasoning whatsoever  Its too bad because we really liked this place  Thank goodness we could hit another place across the street  Left let down and hungry ,?
727427,Chef Daniel is awesome!!!! He accommodated to anything and everything we needed for our party!! He delivers as well!!! The food was so delicious everyone loved it and he makes all kinds of different dishes!!!! We loved that he knew how to make Filipino food  the leche flan is the bomb!!!!!! Best flan Ive ever had!!!! We are not from Vegas so I was counting on him for great food and services and he exceeded in both!!! Ill definitely use him again!!!!!,?
727436,Chef Dave Middleton has completely transformed this neighborhood restaurant from being just ok in my book  too an absolute culinary delight! They have an amazing wine selection at prices a third of what you find on the strip  and with the new food  being put out by their rockstar chef  this restaurant is a contender for my favorite in Vegas!!,?
729106,Chiassos just keeps me coming back  Great coffee  great pastries  nicely lit space  I tend to drink simple black Americanos and this has one of the best Recently I tried there Cocoa Caliente as part of the YYC Hot chocolate fest  Excellent! The whip cream was a great mix for the heat that the drink brings  I cant get enough of Chiassos and will come here as often as my wallet will let me ,?
729852,Chicken Pot Pie  Mac and Cheese  and Croissant Cinnamon Roll were all absolutely amazing I expected great things from the Reviews  and i was blown away  It was beyond expectations ,?
730563,Chicken is almost always consistent  Juicy!!Better for it to be overcooked than under cooked The sides are awesome So many to choose from  so fresh When you sign up   you get super deals online too If you are in the area  a must try,?
730637,Chicken is moist  veggies are fresh  and owners were very friendly and sweet  Exact type of restaurant i want to give my business to   Food is the best Mediterranean food Ive had and if you browse through my reviews Ive been to quite a few  Great bang for your buck kind of spot!,?
730673,Chicken is super dry and fries extra salty every time  Ive tried to give this store plenty of chances but always regret it  Never again Ill drive down to the further one for actual quality !!,?
730817,Chicken nuggets were way too salty  I can still taste the salt  The fries were over cooked and tasted like styrofoam  Waste of money ,?
730934,Chicken pho  Very tasty and cheap ($6)  Super friendly service  Very clean restaurant  Authentic Vietnamese   Hope this place makes it!,?
730989,Chicken potato with cheese is the way to go! Im very picky about my hot sauces  They have two to choose from  Both are delicious!,?
731087,Chicken shack has better service  Food was kinda ok  Service was slow and unorganized ,?

733237,Chinese version of Cheesecake factory  Came here with a friend on a Thursday night at 7:30pm and was told it was a 45 mins  wait  My friend had walked by at 6pm to try to make a reservation in person but they said they wouldnt take it We wind up sitting at the bar to bypass the wait  as they serve the full menu at the bar as well Nothing crazy different on the menu but the bartenders were really nice as we had sat there for over 2 hours We had ordered the crispy green beans which was really tasty  Ma Pao Tofu which was weird that it was crispy tofu served on top of a bed of broccoli  Vegetarian fried rice  ok but also served with a lot of broccoli Will be back to try some of their noodle dishes ,?
733320,Chino is a cool place to take someone who has never been there before   Its strange and fascinating   I live fairly close by and the food is fine  but it certainly doesnt blow your mind   Its the kind of place that I get that Chino craving then I dont need to go for another 6 months or a year   The snickerdoodles are great and come with the meal   Expect to pay close to $10 a person if you get a drink with your meal ,?
733338,Chinois Chicken Salad is a little spicy  but not over the top  Very fresh & zesty with nice fresh carrot & cashews which make it very interesting! The Tequilla Sunrise is great  if only they would offer Alien Tequilla  The smoothest Tequilla in the Universe  Calamari just came     It is soft  not rubbery and the green & red sauces are both delightful  On to the burger  it comes out exactly as you order it    Cartelized onions    What a great burger  Wolfgang is a 10 as usual ,?
733564,Chipotle is by far my favorite fast food restaurant! Even if the line looks like it will take forever you usually dont stand in line for a long time The staff is very friendly  They did run out of one Ingredient and i had to opt for something else which made my meal not as tasty as it usually is  Remember if you want guacamole its always extra! I usually get the burrito bowl but they have lots of options for you to choose from  The great think about this location is that you can take your food and enjoy it at the Union which is just a less than 5 min walk! This is especially great in the summer!,?
733578,Chipotle is dependable  I can always count on them to give me a great  delicious and fulfilling meal at a good price ,?
734501,Chocolate is delish! Had the Dunkn Dip Specialty   Big portion n def satisfies sweet cravings! Their brownies r also a hit :) I just found out today that everything is halal including marshmallows yay!,?
734607,Chocolate  craft beer  and wine; all of my favorite things under one roof  I am sucker for any place with an amazing beer selection  My sister lives in Tremont and Lillys is one of the places we visit every time Im out here  The people working here really know their stuff and everything Ive tried has been heavenly  Its pricey  but I dont live around here so I indulge a bit    Additionally  the decor is lovely  Everything is displayed well without being overwhelming There is ample parking behind the store ,?
734769,Cholla Family Dentistry is fantastic in every way possible!  For someone who really does not enjoy going to the dentist  I had an absolutely incredible experience  Dr Chen and the staff are super friendly knowledgeable and you can tell they all genuinely care about your wellbeing  Really happy I found this place  and would highly recommend it to family and friends  I am looking forward to my next visit!,?
734958,Choose Marnells Cut Steak  and Creamed Corn   this is is AMAZING!!!,?
735065,Choosing a doctor is such an important health decision and I found the best   Dr  Engelman focuses on the latest technology  research and advanced science; AND  he is relatable  providing practical solutions with a caring manner    He and his staff are accessible; available the way I live  online and in person   Greater satisfaction with my care equals better health for me!,?
735872,Chris H  and Taylor did a nice job for us  Ray in the finance department was great and Grady did an outstanding job for us at the end of the sales process ,?
735908,Chris Lservice tech  came by to do our move in orientation  He provided great service and was patient enough to show me around everything around the home ,?

738267,Christy listened and did an excellent job    she is very flexible and an a great personality,?
738796,Chuys is a great Mexican restaurant  They serve Chile Rellenos  which are hard to find in the Charlotte area  Their guacamole is good  The chicken burrito was great  I had the Tex Mex sauce  The burrito was huge  I could not eat it all It can be hard to find good Mexican  Chuys hits the mark with high quality food  then exceeds it with great atmosphere and attentive service ,?
739595,Cinnamon Vanilla French Toast for only $3 99?! Wow  thats a deal! I had ordered it with extra crispy bacon on the side One of the downside   my hubby ordered Greek Omelette but asked for Egg Beaters   they dont have it  they only have egg whites   Why dont have it? Apparently they dont stock those  ONLY egg whites ,?
739684,Circle K employees at this location are very rude  are very slow and are never in any sort of an urge to help out customers  How hard is it to have fresh,?
739914,Cisco rocks!Waiting on fog lights installation(Thanks  Sweetie!)  Cisco is the hardest  thorough  and knowledgeable person at the parts center   Champman Dealership is VERY VERY VEry lucky to have him   I recommend going to only him only because he has a welcoming smile  humor is keen  & not bad on the eyes   Finally  diversity!!!!,?
740028,City BEACH in Montreal !!! And it is free by the way   They have an area for getting your drink on   They have chairs and umbrellas  throw in a free bathroom you can BYOB   The sand is high grain  fine white sand that they truck in so it will get in everything so dress accordingly  ie  sandals   I was there Friday afternoon in August when the weather was perfect and it was not crowded at all  people stopping by to sit and chat for a bit after work They just need water access and it will be complete,?
740035,City Barbecue gets it  Give us a ton of sauce choices with great BBQ  The Brushfire was the perfect blend of spicy and sweet by the way  This place is now my BBQ place of choice in town  Shout out to the fries as well  you got to give a place love if they do them right  Yes sir  You will like this place ,?
740802,Classic French cuisine  The restaurant is a lot bigger than it looks from the outside  Big lofty ceilings make it seem like you arent in Toronto  If youre looking for a classic dish  this is the place to be ,?
741293,Classic family restaurant  Cheap with large portions  have never left unsatisfied  Waitresses are attentive and nice  Food is always above average and consistent  Solid staple in this neck of the woods ,?
742285,Clean   friendly   all around great place   We needed something with a everyday  open for a quick  start to our vacation to cancun   this it  the place   has a lot more than just Tanning      supper helpful   not expensive at all   and can see results right away  ,?
743056,Clean and the attendant was very helpful  The $3 99 washer was so big I put all my laundry in one load  I was in and out in about an hour ,?
743542,Clean food that tastes good  and you can customize for dietary issues or specialized diets (keto friendly!)  They were even able to do a vegan entree for my kid!  The menu is really enormous  you could legitimately eat there every day and not get sick of the food!,?
743545,Clean for Vegas  Out of the way and you will need to lyft to the strip unless you want to hang out in Tijuana  wait I mean circus circus  Family friendly may be a plus ,?
743880,Clean place all the time  always have free samples so people who like those go here! Lines can be very long but tend to go somewhat fast on certain days  Like how they have a section for tvs  cameras  clothes  books  and dvds ,?
744600,Clean store  convenient location  well stocked  and friendly service  The cashiers are pretty quick here  The lines can get busy so having efficient cashiers at checkout is important ,?
744915,Clean  always on time and easy to get an appointment   Shelly Ann is the kindest  most gentle waxer out there  always makes you comfortable and makes you laugh ,?
744979,Clean  bright and colorful are words that I would use to describe this Restaurant Tasty  flavorful and Yum are descriptions of their food  This is my new go to lunch place! I am also extremely happy that it is 5 minutes away from work  that makes it so convenient as well I have tried the following items:Turkey Avocado BLT wrap  Even though they forgot the Avocado  which was a bummer  but the wrap was still really good  You can really taste the freshness of the ingredients  Fireman Ruben  excellent warm sandwich  they do not skimp on the turkey  it is almost too much  almost!Carne Adovada  EXCELLENT! Although a touch too salty  otherwise just a simple well flavored sandwich and very fresh bread I highly recommend AZ Bread company  and I cant waiting to continue to try their different items on the menu  I am also looking forward to trying breakfast there one day  It is nice to have a healthy filling option for a quick and/or relaxed lunch!,?
744983,Clean  bright and quick I came here with my husband  and we both had a comboplatter that included one masala dhosa  an idli  and some sambar  It was all tasty  and waaayyy too much food I guess its a mixed bag because some of his friends (they all work nearby) come here multiple times a week for lunch  and others swear its awful  As for me  I like the chutney bar  its nice to be able to get as much as you want  and I recommend both the coconut chutney and the mint chutney  or  blend them together  like my motherinlaw does with her homemade kind  Yummy I think this place is quite tasty  but I wont come here often  just due to the fact that its a major carb overload  and I wish the dhosas werent quite so expensive (I think theyre about $7 50 for one?) But  that being said  its great for a onceinawhiletreat ,?
744987,Clean  bright facility at Eastern and Viking   Service quick  pleasant and ontime   I really appreciated the fact that intake told someone who was late for her appointment that she could either  reschedule or wait to see if someone else noshowed  I appreciate people being held accountable and not inconveniencing every one else   Past experience tells me my doc will have the results today  and mine was just a routine screening  I like the professionalism at Desert Radiologists ,?
745302,Clean  fresh and delicious  The staff was extremely friendly  The restaurant was very clean for 2pm in the afternoon ,?
745562,Clean  fully equipped with strong air conditioning  LVAC is also well managed and maintained with fun playful employees!This place is my second home     ,?
745887,Clean  nice staff  equipment well maintained  good wifi  clean shower  media for the cardio  good location ,?
746588,Clean; fresh food great selection  Outstanding service  We got here at 11 am all food was fresh and will come back  We learned to stay away from buffets towards the end of the day   Be first    We are stuffed  :),?
746638,Cleaner than most cabsThey come and collect you instead of waiting on a cold or wet street Because all of the drivers are their own business owners essentially  they are motivated to create a clean and pleasant experience  Unlike some yelpers Ive only had one bad experience  One guy who went through a stop sign and then blamed me (to the cop) by saying that I was in a rush  He then was so nervous that he went through another red light  I put it down to being young and stupid  Seems to be a generational thing Other than that service is spectacular They also use gps to take the most efficient route  Have used both uberx and uber black and both are great ,?
746870,Clear Access Law did an outstanding job getting my TRP approved   Attorney Ilir Orana is highly competent and responsive and prepared all documents to enable me to obtain my TRP so I could travel to Canada  I highly recommend Mr  Orana and his firm for immigration related matters ,?
748098,Close to being the ONLY take out that most resembles frozen grocery store pizza This joint is first and foremost a SPORTS bar  Pizza is an singular disaster Choke Choke ChokeAbsolute crap is being kind!,?
749420,Clothesfantastic!!  Pricesgreat discounts!!!  Customer serviceMarlene is outstanding!! :),?
750269,Cockroaches! BEWARE  I do understand that its pretty damn hard to have a restaurant free of cockroaches  one or two I can forgive  But this place is infested  and youll find a lot of roaches in the dining area! I noticed at least 3 different cockroaches crawling up my chair  For that reason alone  Im giving it a 1star review ,?
750382,Cocktails on point! The bartender was fabulous  we had a long convo on about Sazaracs  He knows his stuff  Great setting ! (Valentines Day),?
750793,Cody did an amazing job with our GMC Denali  I have used three different mobile detailing companies in the past and Cody is definitely the best one Ive ever used  Our SUV looks brandnew  We have two young kids who pretty much trash the interior of the vehicle  Cody got it looking as good as when we first bought it  He took very good care and goes above and beyond what I expected  He paid attention to every single detail and did not rush the process  I will definitely be using Codys car care service again in the future  Give him a call! You will not regret it  Thanks Cody! Youre the best!,?
751281,Coffee is always good! Were never disappointed  Tonight because of this icky Cleveland weather  we decided to get some hot cocoa  So we ordered the mexicocoa I believe it was called Omg! So tasty  my husband drank his before we got to the car  It really was an awesome drink  We always like to try different things and to be honest  when it comes to coffee  Im picky  But  this place always has something new and exciting to try  I will definitely be back!,?
751322,Coffee is clearly the breakfast of champions  The classy looking building caught my eye driving down Thomas Road (which I often do) and I was excited to try it out the following morning  I was greeted with friendly service and contemporary decor  The area was littered with young professionals tapping away on laptops using the free wifi service (which earns them a star on its own  IMO) My vanilla soy latte was priced only slightly above average cost  which I am happy to pay to support local business The taste was great not too sweet and a good  strong flavor  Heres the kicker though    As an avid coffee aficionado  I dont often get a caffeine buzz but this latte had me WIRED  Please dont take this as a bad thing I miss that feeling and boy did I get a lot accomplished that morning! Ill be back  Echo Coffee!,?
751912,Coffee was delicious and the place is open 24/7 across the street from our hotel kinda  grabbed a lyft didnt feel like walking  Good service cool environment ! Staff was good ! Had the Denver omelet and had browns  it was okay still a bit wet and they used cheese slices instead of  Shredded and were heavy with onion and pepper  not on meet! French toast  ambrosia with the sour cream omg delicious!!!! Very happy!,?
753348,Color me disappointed  I ordered the 12 piece meal first where is the chicken??? Oh    I forgot they are called nuggets they are meaty but seem on the salty side to me  They are super tiny  The waffle fries make up for lack of chicken kind ofI like the fact that they have A LOT of staff  they are all cheerful and attentive I like the fact that they seem very well trained to keep people on the move and rung up quickly!,?
754500,Come here all the time  great drink selection  love the wings and burgers  Friendly service  everything Ive ordered so far has been good  10/10 would recommend,?
755764,Come hungry because portions are huge but order a beer and relax while they prepare your food  Its not fast good  its oven baked awesomeness  I had the Cajun Chicken  wife had the Italian  We were both very happy with our choices  Ill be coming back on my next Vegas trip ,?
755889,Come in at 2 30 so it was deserted  Thou our waiter was nice  Food is still pretty fresh  Good eat ,?
756131,Come on now Nothing cant top this place for having the best Thai Food! I really love spicy drunken noodles and pad thai noodles here! This place is really cool! Very clean and employees is so sweet and price is right!,?
756429,Come to ChopShop every week before class  but this time was not great  Ordered a Muscle Malt smoothie  it took nearly 15 mins to get even though it wasnt that busy  Turns out one guy started it then left  and left it in the blender (no one seemed to know where it was)  It was also not very tasty  Tastes like lightly flavored ice water   Would not get again  Made me super late for class ,?
756466,Come to Thai Basil if you have a craving for great Thai food  but dont want to pay a lot or wait very long  This local watering hole for ASU staff is a great option for lunch because their prices are great and their wait time is very low  Enjoy great food  good service  and a enjoyable atmosphere at this Tempe favorite ,?
756815,Comfort food in a bowl of heaven!  We lucked out and got a seat at the counter within 5 minutes   Which was fine with me! I love to watch chefs in action  I got the Tonkotsu Ramen with Chashu Pork and Nitamago   The broth was smoky and out of this world!  The portions were huge!  Our server was a sweetheart!  Another great place for my late night cravings!,?
756886,Comfort is seriously the fucking best!!!! Great customer service!!!! Thank you for helping with my indecisive ass  was not expecting to find my costume today but I did so thank you so much!!!,?
758011,Coming from New Mexico this place was delicious  Service was a bit slow but the food made up for it!! Coffee was an eye opener   whippy butter is hard to find and Coffee Pub complimented my pancakes with it!! Wait staff was nice & friendly  OMG     Breakfast here at the Coffee Pub was one of thee best I had while visiting Las Vegas for Spring Break  I would recommend this place to friends and family who plan to visit Las Vegas ,?
758115,Coming from San Diego I wasnt expecting too much from a poke place in Gilbert  but I was genuinely surprised with the fish and the options they gave for toppings  Friendly staff and great poke ,?
758311,Coming from a Greek background and community  this place is as good as it gets in Las Vegas! Excellent and authentic food! Love the staff! Cant wait till next time!,?
758418,Coming from a native Texan  this is top notch BBQ!!! Made me feel at home and loved the staff ,?
758635,Coming from the Aloha Fest  we didnt want to stand in line for food so we walked down Mill and chose this restaurant  We ate outside  our server was here and there My better half had the Lobster Shrimp Tacos and I had the Fish and Chips  My  wife loved her three tacos  Has to be one of the best seafood tacos that she has ordered My fish and chips were cooked perfectly  with a light batter with some crunch to it and the cole slaw was okay Unfortunately  we didnt have any of their brews  but maybe the next time we come back ,?
759173,Coming into an empty restaurant was a bit concerning but all of a sudden business came all at once  We started with shrimp rolls that turned out great and volcano chicken  The volcano chicken had good flavor to it  We will definitely come back again  I gave four stars as another couple ordered after us and was served first  By looks of it  they were regulars there ,?
760389,Compared to other Big Lots Clean  Organized  plenty of stock; and the personnel were really nice ,?
761155,Complete Yard Care has been giving great service  They pay attention to requests and always respond to emails  Ive only been with them a short time but so far Im very satisfied ,?
761426,Complete rip off   they know your problem will not be fixable  yet come out and take your money anyway and say it will be more  plus extra time    who can do that when they own rentals?  This is the most dishonest business in Phoenix!  Especially Eddie!  (He even had the nerve to call me names by text with every other word misspelled)   Very unprofessional   Losers like this should not be in business ,?
761858,Completely different experience this time around!Loved it much better Wonderful Bob Marley playing on their speakers   tv was off  very nice dinnerware and cutlery  Owner/ chef was very welcoming and helpful  warned me about the bones in the goat roti so I went with the chicken one  Great!I had to try this place again  happy I did ,?
762304,Completely ridiculous customer service  You can call a toll free number to make the reservation  but to cancel you need to call the local number in Toronto  AND  when calling said number in Toronto  you get the same person  Rude service and laughably unhelpful ,?
762674,Complimentary neck and scalp massage? Am I in heaven? They know how to make their customers happy! Everybody there is very nice and friendly  I had a first year student who is close to graduating  She did a really good job with my haircut  She was very precise  checked regularly with me if I am okay with what she is doing and her trainer checked in several times as well  $23 for a new  good haircut  I think you cant get that anywhere else  And the students need to practise  so its a win win for everyone  It was easy to get an appointment  It will take longer than your usual visit at the hair salon  so bring something to read or listen to  You can also get a trained and experienced hairdresser who is there to get even better  They are a little more expensive but still a good deal I think  So yes  I do recommend to check this place out!!,?
762701,Compliments of Jetblue because they cancelled my flight and next flight out would be 12 hours later that night on the red eye  So although I didnt stay the night  I was able to get a complimentary room so I could stretch out and take a nap before my next flight  The staff is friendly and courteous the rooms are spacious and clean ,?
762719,Compons is a phenomenal shop: their work is superior and they truly understand customer service   There is not place I would trust to work on my vehicles more!,?
764121,Cons: Uni was very spoiled; was not very fresh  This is my first experience where the uni was not the best  Pros: ambience  Price  Value  Food  Literally everything else but the uni was 5 stars  Me and my girlfriend went here for her birthday  Bought 2 dinner AYCE and $10 sojucan out to $68 without tip  Worth a trip here  if your ever in Vegas  Just hope the uni would be fresher than what I had lol,?
764798,Considering the original location  I dont know what is up with this restaurant  but they need to step it up   My partner and I eat here more than we should due to convenience  but the Willy st  Lao Laan Xang is far superior   Atwood does barely enough to get by  although every once in a while  I swear the food has a funky smell and the vegetables dont taste fresh or of high quality   the spring roll sauce tastes like peanut butter and the egg rolls even taste off    The place always seems busy so I just dont get it    and theres really no excuse anyway Having eating at the Willy St  location a few times recently (after a period of eating at the Atwood restaurant often)  Ive realized what a waste of time and money this location is    If you can make the trip down to the original restaurant at 1146 Williamson Street  do it!!  Skip the Atwood location ,?
765184,Consistency  variety and accessibility make this place awesome  They have a lot of different cookies  pastries  omelettes  and crepes  Great for breakfast  events  meetings  a hostess gift  etc I find myself frequenting La Boulangerie more and more frequently  each new pastry I try opens my eyes further to the Calgary patisserie scene  The crepe hot plate used to prepare crepes and omelettes is authentic and a nice way to take this place for a spin! My goto here is the lemon ricotta pastry and their AMAZING coconut bran muffin  Pretty amazing considering that I dont really care for coconut flavoured anything ,?
765227,Consistent and delicious!  try the wellness drink! I can eat here everyday  The barbecue chicken pizza is my favorite ,?
765632,Consistently a good  locally owned restaurant   My wife and I have really enjoyed eating here  and everybody who we bring from out of town has not been disappointed   The traditional hero and pomegranate chicken are always good  If you are feeling like dessert  the baklava crust on their cheesecake is amazing ,?
766789,Consistently great small plates and beer! Ive been a few times and tried the lamb lollipop small plate  the turkey sandwich  both were savory and tasty  They have a good beer selection and nice staff ,?
768014,Continues to be one of the best bakeries in Cleveland  perhaps THE best   Delicious cakes  and very friendly service   Almond Joy cookies melt in your mouth!,?
769043,Convenient location to watch movies as it is right along highway 7 and woodbine right next to an array of asian restaurants at First Markham Place (loads of cheap and delicious eats to choose from!)  The theatre generally offers and array of movies and show times that are non 3D or AVX which I find are sometimes hard to find  especially on Friday night  It generally isnt as crowded as nearby SilverCity theatre at Yonge and Highway 7  so it is relatively easier to find a parking spot and get tickets  The theatre itself is pretty clean and the chairs are pretty comfy  I admit this place is a bit outdated and could use some renovating especially the washrooms  but I does provide pretty good theatre experience ,?
769141,Convenient location  quick drop off  fast turnaround  simple pick up  All for about $5 and I never had to get out of my car! Couldnt ask for more!,?
769200,Convenient location  Smaller store than the big boxes means a lot less wandering around  Helpful staff  Good selection; youd be surprised what theyre able to pack into this small location  Save yourself the frustration; try Foothills Ace first  Theyll probably have what youre looking for  and youll save a ton of time too ,?
769378,Convenient well stocked store  helpful staff   Larry in the paint department is great and talented at matching a previous color  Prices are fair and store is clean and well maintained ,?
769441,Convenient  easy and the whole staff is very friendly   And if you pay ahead its only about $5 a day depending on where in the structure you park ,?
769848,Conveniently located next to the Giant Eagle  easy to get in/out of   cant ask much more!!,?
769946,Conveniently located within the Palazzo right next to the elevator entrance  cleverly placed if you ask me  Service was quick and efficient for a Saturday morning  Id say they pretty much got the rhythm of things  However  I did feel extremely rushed when placing my order which was kind of annoying since I dont frequent CBTL that often  OverallGood location and decent staff ,?
770360,Cookout honestly needs to pick up there game in there customer service every time I order frys they come out soggy or barely stable  Im not person to complain but Ive been coming to this cookout for years this place seriously needs to step up in cooking the McDonalds down the street is better cooking cmon ,?
770955,Cool atmosphere  friendly  coffee   not great  Tried several times at the behest of my wife (who likes it)  but wont waste my time anymore,?
771548,Cool concept  but way overpriced and not good ice cream flavor   Cashier rushing us to make our choices  felt pressure not relaxed atmosphere  Cant get multiple flavors only allowed one  I got kids size coffee with caramel and heath bar mixed in and my daughter got large green tea mochi mixed in     18 00  Yes you read that right  18 00  Will never go back  Very disappointed  Its just gimmicky and not quality  I have paid significantly less for greater quality ice cream   Thrifty ice cream is even better  Dont waste your money or time here ,?
771892,Cool fromagerie on the way to the Jean Talon market  They have a huge selection of cheeses as well as some intersting jams  cookies and crackers  My friend and I picked up their excellent little tote bags  There was some misunderstanding about the price of these  but the owners resolved the issue in our favor and we only paid $1 39 for our cute little bags  The bags are great with holders included inside for wine bottles  Ill definitely be back ,?
771895,Cool funding site and allows funder to pay fees so person raising funds does not have to pay that too   Also allows direct deposit :),?
772077,Cool interior  Did not eat here  Beautiful filings  Fascinating renovation  Nice tourist site to visit briefly Coffee seemed pricy Food is not under the main hall and a side hall  so would not come here to eat if you want to appreciate the high ceiling and large open windows ,?
772451,Cool little place  looks like an old Dairy Queen Bldg  Fun decor and friendly and efficient service  We came in for breakfast and Ive found them to be pretty pricey  $2 85 for iced tea  $11 50 for 3 slices of French toast and $4 00 side of bacon is more like NYC pricing  It took a long time for the food to come out of the kitchen but everything looked very good and tasted very good  Overall Id have to say the food and service were very good but I didnt find it to be a good value ,?
772549,Cool little shopping place  The kids really enjoyed it  Tree house was cool but slide was out of order  Big Legos were really fun for my 10 and 9 year old  Cool little novelty shops and food shops ,?
772759,Cool location is in the McCormick Ranch area  I have been to most of their other locations  This one is on par with the rest of their restaurants  Nice large patio in a cool dark modern Decor  Good daily specials and happy hour Monday through Friday 3 to 6 p m ,?
773265,Cool place for eats and drinks  Small but has good atmosphere  Service and food options are great Robert Pfeifer,?
773553,Cool place to hang out on a day off   !  Great hot dogs and the beer lineup was very tempting  Next time   Fries were ok but the mac & cheese was spectacular  Next time Ill skip the fries   Not many vegetarian options  even the mac & cheese had bacon  The patio out back is great for big groups of friends and it has a stage for bands  Thanks  Yelp  for finding this great place!,?
773956,Cool place  didnt get a chance to go on the guided tour  saw the smaller yard  pretty cool and the two volunteers were very helpful  nonprofit piece of vegas history  one tip  BOOK ONLINE AHEAD! They sellout a month in advance(for the guided)its in somewhat of a bad area  but the lot and facility is secure and clean  Well be back ,?
774491,Cool restaurant in the heart of downtown Toronto at Keele & Dundas area  It was a a Wednesday nite so it wasnt jammed  Cheap parking just off Keele btw!I order the Hot Italian Sausage Pizza with a delicious house made Broken Hipster beer  The Za was delicious  Just the right combo of dough  sauce & hot Italian Sausage  It was hot  crispy & fabulous!! All washed down by my Broken Hipster  a clean tasting lager  Our waiter Dustin was great  Her was patient  quick & attentive  Well done for him! This is a definite doover!,?
774727,Cool spot  take in the private plane traffic  outstanding service  great food all the way down the menu   Can get busy on many days but love this spot for breakfast early or for lunch!,?
774809,Cool spot in Phoenix for brunch and beverages   Had the crab Benedict which was really good and I would order it again   Also  got an order of the small donuts with jam for the group and they were eaten in no time  Would return here again and probably try some lunch/dinner options as Ive heard those are good ,?
775297,Cool trendy little spot in downtown Pittsburgh  We started with the fried brussle sprouts which were different but suprisingly good  For entrees my wife and I had the Pork chop and the chicken  The pork chop was very well prepared and definitely not recommended for someone whos not hungry as its huge  The chicken was tasteful tender and juicy  My only complaint is the round tables tend to be on the small side and can make eating slightly uncomfortable if you have more than two plates and drinks ,?
776144,Copper has quite possibly the best Indian food that I have ever tasted   I recently asked a colleague who is of Indian descent  which Indian restaurant has the best food in Charlotte   He told me his favorite was Copper and he suggested that I go there for lunch   I did and was truly impressed   I had spinach soup along with naan and cheese with spinach   All were great as was my server   His recommendation was spot on and I cannot wait to return ,?
779631,Couldnt have asked for a better breakfast    Server was attentive not annoying  Pancakes are HUGE    Not too loud    Plenty of seats ,?
779679,Couldnt have asked for a more beautiful setting  The TV is HUGE and the food is very fresh  Thanks for a great experience!,?
780735,Courteous and skillful  Great service  Used Bill for a car tint  but have also had colleagues use him for commercial tinting  They were very pleased  Will definitely use him again  Also love the lifetime warranty ,?
781740,Cozy greasy spoon! Good food  not fancy  snowbird favorite!,?
782299,Cozy place with great Mexican food  Chips were warm and we ordered the street tacos  Chicken and beef  loved the taste and not spicy which is perfect for me  The machaca is spicy so if you are in for that you can get those or always add in the chili sauce ,?
782445,Cozy warm and quiet atmosphere  you can talk without shouting  Food and service excellent too  3 person with wine $120  Quality vs price excellent  I will return,?
782868,Crab stuffed grilled shrimp and bananas foster   WOW   You can come here in a suit or jeans   Great bar and fantastic wine selection ,?
783004,Cracked screen & he fixed it in 30 min and gave me a screen protector  Highly recommended !,?
783462,Craig and his team are knowledgeable  efficient  and personable  They are currently handling my personal injury case and I am extremely happy I decided to have Craig represent me  Definitely professional and would highly recommend to anyone!,?
783722,Crap hole             I drove up  to this place from west Ahwatukee  looking for miniatures and not knowing anything about this RPG stuff  The kid behind the counter was as helpful as a brain dead chimp  There was absolutely no organization of the game pieces its just thrown all over  I should have stayed home and not wasted my gas or time  Would have been faster and cheaper to get what I needed online  Would give it zero stars if I could ,?
784194,Crave is one of the best spots in Charlotte!! Great food  desserts  and spirits and even better hookah!! Sunny BEST FREAKING SERVER EVER!!,?
785116,Crazy fast in and out  with a shampoo  Felicia was awesome  normally I go to a barber or hair salon  been crazy busy my hair was a mess  Id definitely come back ,?
785470,Cream city ice cream is heaven in a cup! Real home made fresh ice cream the way it should be made  Its like the difference between a store bought tomato and a backyard grown one or eating fish the same day its caught  Once you have this real ice cream  youll never want anything else  Plus you can tell the owners love and take pride in their product very friendly service ,?
785768,Creative burgers and sides  Very good! The owner even cane out to see how everything was  Would definitely go back!,?
785902,Creative take on Asian dishes but thought the truffle ramen was a trap that I fell for Spicy cucumber starter (5/5)  delicious and light  Almond adds a good bitePork belly bun (4/5)  still solid execution with a good cutTruffle ramen (2/5)  hugely disappointing  Pricey as truffle is but this was very much the sum of its parts and not elevatedWould come back and avoid the expensive traps,?
785939,Creative  greattasting dishes and good cocktails  Service leaves room for improvement  Server was disinterested and would disappear for long stretches ,?
786498,Crew was able to come out within 24 hours  3 team members showed up and got straight to work scrubbing down a very dirty home  The crew used a lockbox to enter and exit while I was away  It was a big job  a few touch ups were needed  and the crew swung by same day and completed everything as asked  Will use again  thank you ,?
786817,Crispy quail with that salt/pepper/lime juice dip   absolutely like crack for me  Could barely stop in order to eat the pho  which lived up to my standards (I thinkit was hard to taste it with all that zesty salt/lime flavor still on my tongue from the quail)  :)  Tender meat  perfect noodles  FRESH sprouts bursting with moisture  green basil (not blackened) and large  thinly sliced jalapenos   AND theyre open in the mornings  earlier than some  Woot!Dont judge it by the exterior   not prepossessing  But the interior is pleasant and the service was kind and swift   Also  they have a garden patio off the interiorwould probably be lovely on a warm day with the fountains fountaining and all ,?
788057,Crystal (woman with tattoos and red hair) is EXTREMELY rude and unprofessional  Every time we visit this ulta shes always seems so condescending to us just because were younger and i feel like she thinks were going to steal? Lol such an annoying and unnecessary attitude ,?
788975,Cupcakes are pretty and taste delicious  Place looks really clean  Happy associates   Not so happy with the pricing   I think I can buy the same cupcake for less  probably not as pretty  but probably the same taste ,?
789168,Cure is a great place! Fun atmosphere  great service and the food is amazing  The only place in Pittsburgh that you can get food like this ,?
789350,Currently I think their customer service  is the worst I have encountered  They say (Patty) that they will call you with status updates     They dont  They tell you that your car will be ready on a certain day    It isnt  They post hours that they are open     I cannot get past answering machine  I am having to deal with them through my son who is busy earning an education  They know that I am calling from Vegas  I think their ratings are paid for because I am not happy at this very moment,?
789444,Currently eating my farm fresh veggie pizza from Nelly Belly  Incredibly good  I told my wife I would get something from a food truck event today and was thinking it would be half of a pizza and a taco    looks like it will only be tacos The crust is by far the best part  Perfectly sweet and savory The wait can be a little longer  but it is because they dont put the pizza in the oven until AFTER you order it  Well worth it to have true blue wood fired pizza ,?
789552,Currently just tried to visit the store but came across a sign on the door that said closed for a family emergency  will open tomorrow at 1:00  Well there was no date on the sign to tell when they put up the sign and when they would be opening  Walked to the door and there was a sales associate inside  I thought the sign might have been old or from yesterday and they hadnt taken it down yet since I arrived exactly when the open at 1:00pm  The lady then tried mouthing something to me multiple times from behind the counter and then proceeds to walk to the door and screams can you not see the sign  we are closed? Extremely rude and unprofessional especially seeing as their sign had no specifics regarding dates  Ive shopped here before but as a customer  being yelled for trying to confirm when they were closing and opening is completely unacceptable,?
789745,Currently sitting in ruby tuesdays   Service started off well  until my salmon Cesar salad came out and my salmon was raw! The annoying thing was  the server actually BROUGHT it out raw   I saw the pink meat before she even set it down   When I asked to have it cooked through  it was brought back broken into bits and my lettuce was wilted and gross   (Obviously it was tossed back on the flat top  which I wouldnt have minded had it not come back looking like cat food) the manager came over and was immediately apologetic  removed the plate and advised he would not be charging me for me  Our waitress came over and offered different options and apologized! Every once in awhile the back of house messes up  but the way they handled it was professional and quick! S/o to Desiree our waitress and Jesse the manager! Way to handle it ,?
789820,Currently staying on the 11th floor  Great hotel  Rooms are clean and suites are large  Dont hear any noise from other neighboring rooms or atrium  Washer and dryer are in same area as ice machine and dont cost anything to use  Breakfast has been consistently good  can smell the bacon from our floor! Susan has been a terrific waitress even giving our kids food to feed the fish! Btw  5 and under dine free ,?
790209,Curtis and Michelle came to clean out carpets just last week and they look so great! Really  like brand new!! The stains havent come back like they do with other carpet cleaners so I am a true believer in the magic wand! I will definitely be a repeat customer!,?
790235,Curtis was GREAT!  very helpful and explained all the features of the car we purchased   Would recommend him in a heartbeat ,?
790577,Customer Service is so so good  They treat you like family   Preparadas  pozole  mole  muchacha all amazing choices   Will definitely be back!,?
791277,Customer service here is bad  Ive tried to like this place and give it a try but just cant  Taking a tables order who sat before me and havent even asked for my drink order is plain rude  This has happened on a number of times  Once ok maybe I let slide but a few times after is ridiculous  Also service is slow  There have been occasion when my coworkers and I end up coming back to work late from lunch because they took forever to get our bill and food took longer than needed to come out  For any restaurant food should take average 15 mins to come out unless noted or advised by wait staff Now the food  Its bleh  As I have said before it does not amaze  They have gone through a few menu changes since Ive first been here  Sorry but Id rather drive a little further and get better tasting thai food and better service    maybe if you are white they might be more attentive   just saying while observing you can tell  they prefer certain colors better ,?
791416,Customer service in this store is seriously lacking!  I usually frequent the outlet or Downtown Summerlin location but I had an item to return and other errands at this mall so I stopped in  I dont like the vibe here  Unlike the other locations where you are greeted or at least acknowledged before you make it to the rear of the store that is not the case here   The sales associates were just chatting among themselves   I wasnt even offered assistance until I had an item in my hand and one foot in the dressing room area   The one positive about this store is they do seem to have a large selection of sales items which I havent always found to be the case at Downtown Summerlin or Fashion Show  but I dont need to frequent a store for that when I can shop online ,?
791464,Customer service is THE single most important thing for any business and tonight our service was shit  We were at Bay 109 (8:309:30) There was a mistake with our check and we were charged for extra time  Our server was trying to rush us out of that space (I get it  they want their money) but she had to fix our check and I guess it took too long for her and she brought some guy over (manager?) who was rude  He asked You got everything figured out?! and I asked him what figured out? He said  I dont know but we need you guys out cause we have another group coming (as the other people sat) We asked for a box for our food that we ordered and they couldnt waste time so that all got thrown away  That guy was an assclown ,?
791570,Customer service is always horrible  The employee Alexis is disrespectful  rude  and incompetent  Food orders were incorrect  Definitely would drive the extra few miles to avoid this location ,?
791776,Customer service is exceptional   fast service  friendly and honest  I would highly recommend this company ,?
792595,Customer service makes the difference   and Boston Pizza clearly has no knowledge of the meaning  Calling in for a delivery for my company I found the man on the other end annoyed I was calling and irritated that I had a pretty lengthy order  He couldnt tell me how much the delivery charge was either  One thing he was excellent at was repeating the order to ensure accuracy yet when I received the order there were fried mushrooms added to the bill  The delivery man was even less thrilled about his job too  Perhaps this is understandable  but he refused to speak to me and only pointed to what he needed from me Food was  as always  mediocre at best  So if youre in the mood for rude employes  long wait times and semidecent food you better check this place out ,?
794157,Cute and cozy restaurant located across the Bellagio   If you can sit outside  you can watch the fountains while eating!Free delicious bread! yay carbs!First time trying escargo (appetizer   approx $10) and lobster (came in the seafood platter for approx $50 which feeds two: two lobster  four jumbo shrimps  four oysters  seaweed salad  and two cracker baguettes with avocado  salmon sashimi  and tomatoes dip)   Try to get reservations   This place gets packed and I could definitely see why ,?
794463,Cute breakfast cafe away from the smokiness of the casino  The specials are an amazing deal  Food is consistently good quality and they have a wide variety of breakfast and lunch items  Service is friendly and casual  Great place to relax and enjoy brunch  They also have a great selection of hot teas!,?
794523,Cute but tight  Not expensive and creative  I love the place  the decoration makes you feel at home  Bread its good and coffee is really tasty  Its one of my favorite places in Montreal!,?
794819,Cute concept  I had the birthday cake snow cone  It was good and the flavor was on point but you have to eat it right away  The shakes got a little clumpy after an hour and it taste pretty fake if you put it in the frig then drank it the next day  But service was great!,?
795031,Cute family owned business   Very clean with an Italian flare   I had the meatball sandwich   It was juicy and hearty   The flavour was okay  not great  but I chalk that up to personal preference   I would try something else next time   The portion size was good  there was a lot of meat in the sandwich   Price wasnt bad   A good spot for a homemade sandwich for lunch where you can watch the news while you eat ,?
795180,Cute interior setup like a house  We sat at the bar at the top most level and were delighted to discover a skylight in the roof  Cocktail: Kingston 10  Tequila based  Tasted like skittles  in a good way Mains: goat curry and half a jerk chicken  The jerk chicken apparently takes longer to prepare but it came out first  It was pretty good with a decent side of slaw  The goat curry was rich and had nice heat to it without being too hot to enjoy  Came with a nice mango chutney and rice  The 2 mains were probably a bit too much food for one person but just 1 main would not have been enough  A main  starter should suffice  We went in with the mistaken perception that its a quickservice place  (Just assumed)  But takes as long as any another dinein place  Maybe 90 minutes for the meal  But time flew as we were admiring the decor Good service  Very present ,?
795984,Cute little hidden spot in the midst of Downtown Toronto  I really enjoyed the margarita pizza ,?
797269,Cute little tapa bar  with really appetizing food and a super friendly staff  We went there on a colder day and just the whole experience made us feel warm inside  You should definitely try it!,?
797452,Cute name! Cute bakery! Cute cupcakes! Amazing ice cream cookie sammies! They allow mix and match cookie faces  The big kids working there are cool  Theres music entertainment  Look up! Disco ball and sparkly floors  Not sure how to tie in the theme  But like a teenage girls fun room with cupcakes  I suppose  Just cute! Special cake orders available  Elegant but simple one was in display (see pic) Suggestions: try one of each cupcake and cookie :D,?
798427,Cute place  Loved the atmosphere  Service and food was great  The parking      well not so much  We had to park kinda far since they dont have a big parking lot but thats something anyone can just look past ,?
798620,Cute restaurant with delicious food! Our server was extremely knowledgable and provided helpful recommendations on the items available  I ordered a Thai iced green tea and it was amazing! My friend got the purple lemonade  which didnt have much taste to it (but they let us know prior to ordering)  however it looked amazing and was definitely picture worthy  We also ordered the spring rolls (which I dont usually like tofu)  the crispy rolls (which were delicious and I dont usually like mushrooms)  Red Curry (amazing and perfectly spicy)  Pad Thai  chicken and moowei (probably not spelled correctly)  Highly recommend!,?
798805,Cute shop  filled with a million different things   Randomly walking by (thats my theme!) and saw a sign for Kawartha ice cream   Got a double scoop in a cup   One was cherry  the other     raspberry?    cant really remember but both were delicious   A nice offthebeaten path place  really cool concept   Ill be back!,?
799869,Cuts are average to good depending on who you get  Not my location of choice ,?
799941,Cvs is my favorite store and Pharmacy!The staff is super Friendly  and helpfull #close to my house and is easy to walk w/love it!!!!,?
801211,DELICIOUS FOOD! Great service  and the mood in this restaurant was wonderful  Its better than the Keg in my opinion! My date and I each got starter Caesar salad and bread  steak and a lobster tail with mashed potatoes and grilled vegetables  and two alcoholic beverages and it came to just over $90  Not horrible for all the food we got!,?
801402,DELICIOUS! Easily one of the best sushi spots in Cleveland! I had the Hawaiian and Parma rolls and both were awesome,?
801806,DEPLORABLE customer service! I have been here four times for takeouts  and I literally ripped their takeout menu b/c I wont be returning again  I will rather eat less tasty foods than coming back here again  I ordered the lunch special today  and when I showed up  the Chinese gentleman didnt greet me nor even smiled at me  He literally threw the pen at me for me to sign the CC receipt!!! Really?!! Completely RUDE and uncalled for!! The other three times  a different guy helped me with the takeout orders  and horrible customer service as well  The guy didnt lift his head up from writing on a piece of paper when I walked in  He was nonchalant and couldnt care less about the customers!!!,?
803078,DO NOT BUY FROM HERE  These guys will lie every way possible the sales team is horrible  I will take this review down when the owner feels like working with his customer   DO NOT BUY FROM HERE,?
803449,DO NOT COME HERE  Go to Tempe market place for true customer service  Ive been having troubles with my phone and iMessage so I exchanged it with an iPhone 8  The next day  I realized the phone was way to big and was truly hurting my hand so much  Sam said hed help me  brought out a new phone and sim and everything ready to exchange  he than said whoops I cant do the exchange  Of course I was confused and asked questions  He responded I dont know why youre being difficult I work in customer service and I understand a company can have rules but calling me difficult is highly inappropriate  when I disclosed that to him he shrugged his shoulders with no remorse  So disrespectful and no integrity ,?
803859,DO NOT EAT HERE  My sister and I ordered from this restaurant because we have tried a different nicks before and loved it  This location is a disgusting representation Nicks Famous Shawarmas  Not only did the shawarmas have hardly any meat in them  they made us both sick afterwards     We both got terrible headaches and later puked up everything    I have never eaten a meal that caused a headache before this  After looking up the restaurant online  its half a hookah store? Very disturbing  ,?
804387,DO NOT GO HERE! Absolutely terrible  I honestly dont understand how they are in business  Its all you can eat  however didnt allow me to pick what I wanted to eat  And if I decided to choose  I had to pay more?!,?
804623,DO NOT GO HERE!!!  They will rip you off   They tell you they will look up your benefits for you   Told me I had a $25 copay   Then 2 months later got a bill for $1200 80   When I called got a nasty lady named Alexis saying they made a mistake but too bad for me   I said I would have never gotten the procedure done if I was told the truth and she said too bad you owe the money   They knew I wouldnt have got it done   Just greedy   Then she threatened me with a collection company   Of ciurse  I looked on here too late  Apparently  they have done this before ,?
804974,DO NOT GO HERE  Unless you like UNHELPFUL  people and love giving money away  The staff and dentists are not personable and only care about how much you insurance will cover and your wallet  They do not discuss your health with you  They are not informative  I had a terrible experience ,?
805343,DO NOT GO TO WILL  If you want a good cut do not go to will  He does bad business  and cannot cut hair  Very disrespectful  I will not be returning to this shop  Save your money ,?
805875,DO NOT ORDER FOOD FROM HERE  We ordered and paid for a Christmas dinner delivery a month in advance and never received our food  The restaurant (and Janet) would not answer their phones or return voicemails  Extremely unprofessional behavior  We will never return to Buca di Beppo ,?
807083,DO NOT USE BASIC ECONOMY  They intentionally make it awful and their website issues errors while you try to check in  You cant even upgrade out of it  It is the worst airline experience Ive ever had ,?
807665,DO NOT USE this dry cleaner!!! After I paid the $34 dollars  the lady showed me that they had ruined one of my pieces  My cream cashmere/cotton summer weight sweater had blue ink all over it  She blamed another customer saying he had left a pen in his pocket  I told her it had cost $150 and she just looked at me asking what she could do  Again I told her it cost $150  She offered $30  I told her I just paid you over $30 and you ruined my clothes  Im not paying you to ruin my clothes and again told her the price of the sweater  She reached in the cash register and handed me two twenties  $40 after I paid her $34 for destroying my clothes  A reputable place would have told me up front  not charged me and would have offered to replace it  Pathetic!!!,?
807760,DO NOT VISIT THIS LOCATION  Let me start off by saying I have gave this location plenty of opportunities and Im finally fed up  On 2/21 I placed an online order for a chicken bowl when I got home the bowl had absolutely no chicken  HOW IS THAT EVEN POSSIBLE  The employee acted like it was not a big deal  Check the food before you leave  I just dont understand how hard it can be when all the ingredients are listed and its easy to follow? Im never on time when I place these online orders I can come in almost half an hour after the meal is supposed to be ready and its not  There is ALWAYS something missing on the order or stuff added that I didnt even ask for  Employees are rude as hell  They still have the nerve to get mad at you for the idiotic mistakes they make  I am never visiting this location ever again ,?
807780,DO NOT WASTE YOUR $  service was extremely slow and they charge $11 for a Titos & soda (very weak)  Kids were going crazy by the end of the meal and bill was wrong  ridiculous experience ,?
808230,DO NOT lease from here  Sent me to collections before even coming to me about the issue  Received the large collections notice four months later and the day before my wedding  I sent multiple emails and never heard back from management after I moved out  BEWARE of scumbags,?
809027,DONT EAT HERE  GOT FOOD POISONING!!!! I ended up in emergency with a bad case of food poisoning  The food is of bad quality and the service is horrible  Never going back  DO NOT EAT THIS CRAP!!!!,?
809550,DONT WASTE YOUR TIME!!They come off like a reputable company who will offer you top dollar for your items   They correspond with you through email asking for pictures of the items you want to sell but all they will offer you is $50 00 dollars for anything you have   NOT WORTH THE TROUBLE!!!!!,?
811218,Daisy is awesome!!!  Gave me the best haircut Ive ever had and fixed what other stylists have messed up in the past   Im moving to Chicago but I will definitely be coming back to Wisconsin just for her to continue cutting my hair  Thank you Daisy!!! Youre the best!,?
811731,Damn Roy  you are an expensive place  but so worth it! We try to only save Roys for special occasions  And  use it as an excuse for that chocolate cake  Its so nice to be able to share a delicious dessert with my glutenfree Husband at a restaurant  I have never been disappointed by the food or service  Only a little sad everytime that check rolls around ,?
811915,Damn good gelato   the best Ive ever had and its 1/3rd the fat of normal gelato   dont know how they do it  but it absolutely ROCKS!!!  Love this place and the staff is the absolute BEST and FRIENDLIEST   the other restaurants nearby should send their wait staff over to Frost for lessons in Customer Service ,?
812143,Damn these tacos are pretty good!!!!!Every time i come to vegas ibstop by for tacos de buche and un quesadilla de asada!!!! Hits the spot all the time!!!!,?
812662,Damn    this place is amazing with all its hidden treasures  The ready made burek meat pie is out of this world  as long as youre not on a diet  There are frozen foods to bake at home that are equally as delicious  and their selection of unique desserts is outstanding  Ive tried a few and could not be pressed to pick my favorite one  as theyre all so different and soooo good  Finally  their bread and breadtype products remind me of something that you would pick up in the morning in a European bakery and stuff awesome deli meat and cheese into ,?
813229,Dan tinted the windows on my 2012 Camero a few years ago  I was kinda skeptical because he dose work out of his garage  And my appointment was so early in the am it was still dark  And me being a female it was kinda scary  (Not the area just the situation)  Once I got there I called him and he proceeded to pull my car In the garage  There are seats so you can sit and watch the entire process witch is kinda cool  He is very friendly   Now on to the tint  I wanted my tint dark dark  But he advised me to get a certain tint because I wouldnt be able to see  And he was right I LOVE my tint and its still holding up today ,?
813910,Dang  Not Pei Wei  But much cheaper and still good ,?
814070,Danis Agency has provided me with some amazing opportunities that would not have been possible without their hard work and dedication to their clients  Ive gotten a variety of interesting work  the most exciting being a national PetSmart commercial! I have never been with another agency  but I am very glad I decided to sign with Danis and Im excited for what the future holds with their help! I like that Danis is a family business and I enjoy working with Dani  Misti  and Bill   If you are looking for representation  I highly recommend meeting with them and getting the feel of their agency; it is exactly what I was looking for!,?
814166,Daniel and Tara gently and lovingly placing blue hair bows into my baby girls hair   Tara and Daniel The Best   My dog Really likes them   Each time my dog sees them she goes berserk   Barking in the car  she cant wait to get inside and say Hi!  My dog  reacts this way because she feels safe when she is with them   Have any of you seen the dog and pawrent reunion videos?  Im sure most of you have   Yep  her excitement is just like the dogs in the videos ,?
815591,Dark Horse on Spadina is an excellent spot to grab a coffee and bask in a cool and inviting atmosphere  Its situated at the foot of the Centre for Social Innovation (still dont know whats going on in this building) and is the standout coffee star of Chinatown  What they lack in bubble tea they make up for in all things caffeinated   Their espresso is always excellent   I recently tried their iced coffee for the first time and it was great   Not too icy   If that makes sense to you   It doesnt?  Move along Obligatory Title Pun: Quit STALLION and go here now!Menu Readability:  Liquid crayon on a board as tall as Shaq Need to mention:  My laptop was out of batteries and I was told no plugs  so I guess no plugs What this place teaches me about myself: I would say more here  but Im feeling a little HOARSE   (Bonus pun!),?
815684,Dark meat chicken and waffles? Waffle was rubbery   chicken was scrawny  New heights grill has better chicken and waffles  Rib cage better everything else ,?
815837,Darlene is meticulous and thorough with her gel manicures and pedicures  She made sure my nails were perfect before leaving and they lasted up to 10 days! Ill definitely be going to Darlene again  Shes also got a lovely personality ,?
817002,Date: 03/21/2012 WednesdayTime: 10:08 AMMy intentions were to eat at a breakfast buffet  I arrived at Green Valley Ranch Feast Buffet and the waited 48 minutes in line  The cut off is 11:00 AM  So I stayed for the $7 99 lunch buffet (with the Players Card Free ) I obtain 5min before standing in line for free This is certainly a Quantity over Quality place  I did eat at the Fiesta Lunch buffet for lunch  a few days ago  And they are both own by the same owners  This lunch buffet has better ingredients / items  than the Fiesta Buffet  but  it still okay based on my overall experience The highlights would be the Bass  Tuna salad  and they do have pita bread with hummus and plenty of greens  That alone  I would rate 3 5 or of 5 stars for nonmeater eaters or flexitarians Customer services was okay  More than likely  I wont be returning Food: 2 of 5 Service: 3 of 5Price: 3 5 of 58 of 10,?
817142,Daughter and I just my chance found this place   The empanadas are a must try  we shared the panko grilled chicken  mashed potatoes and cornbread casserole; everything was so good cooked to order   Everything was flavorful and delicious! Our server was so friendly ,?
817301,Dave Biggerstaff came and inspected a foreclosure for me   He was there for at least 4 hours   He pointed out major stuff as well as minor stuff   He was extremely thorough and professional   He answered the million questions I had   I am extremely satisfied with their services ,?
818102,David Chang  love you  love your show  Im at your restaurant in Vegas and had to send shoyu pork ramen back because it was cold  Second time was a little better but still not hot  but the flavor was on point    if you came here and ordered this  youd be pissed  Pork belly bun was bomb though  Get your ass down here and regulate  Please and thank you ,?
818216,David Pedley is by far the best when it comes to Keretin Treatments! I have had other stylists that have done Keratin Treatments and my hair doesnt fall right and the treatment doesnt last as long  This is my sixth treatment with David  Hes a little pricy but worth it! David also does my cut & color which is also amazing!,?
818283,David Woollen was right on time for the appointment  worked quickly while explaining what he was doing thoroughly  and offered helpful advice on things we could do to keep pests out of our living areas until the next service in two months  It was great meeting him and seeing him in action  very knowledgeable and professional  Five Stars ,?
818785,David loves barbecue  so after visiting some friends up north  we stopped by to grab a bite on the way home    We had both heard people rave about how wonderful Bubbas is    so our expectations were pretty high   I had the BBQ Chicken  David had some sort of  BBQd pork   and we split an order of onion rings   The food was good but not great   But the employees were very friendly and helpful  Even though we had never been there before  they made us feel right at home ,?
819694,Days have past and the newness is wearing off  Arrived early for the movie and asked for 3d glasses  First we were told we would have to wait  Then after 20 minutes asked again and the young lady rolled her eyes and ignored us  Seconds later she started handing out glasses  Once we were given the glasses we found finger prints on the lenses and the glasses didnt feel clean  Watched them take the baskets of glasses to the food area  Wondering how they cleaned them  Lastly the fourth hand full of popcorn had plastic in the bucket   picture to prove it   Kinda think we will go back to our older theaters  The staff are always helpful and have never had anything in our popcorn Movie was great     Seats are nice ,?
819703,Daysi provided excellent costumer service! She gave me a good price for the vehicle i have thank you daysi! Would recommend her to anyone ,?
819708,Daytime bowling review Pros: Weekday special pricing is reasonable  Nice staff  Fun decor  Uptown location Con: If you are even a semiserious bowler  dont bother; the lanes are very distracting  Each lane has a mix of balls  Im not sure what you do if the specs there dont meet your needs ,?
819716,Daytime review: Two people recommended it so we were excited to come  but I think I was expecting a litttttle more from The Beaver then what it turned out to be  Our fault for coming by so early in the evening  I guess At Saturday around 8pm there were only 3 tables full for dinner  It was quiet and pretty empty  The menu is more suited for a quick lunch bite (burgers  tacos etc   )  then any fulfilling dinner  but it was tasty and quick  The burger was very good  and the gin cocktail grapefruit fancy pants drink was fine  Spent about $22 USD  I guess we came too early to experience the gay scene  Oh  well ,?
820222,Dealership is wonderful!  Courteous  friendly and quick  The showroom is beautiful and the waiting room offers beverages  pastries  TV and Wifi while you wait  Bought two cars and will continue to get all my vehicles from Nick ,?
820500,Dean has been part of my family since I was a baby  My mom took me to Dean Fish Hatchery for many many years  Now that Ive grown older and moved to Middleton I visit the Dean West Clinic  This is a nice facility with adequate parking  Youll find 3 floors with departments like Optometry  Internal Medicine  Family Medicine etc  This location also has a pharmacy and Davis Duehr Dean eye store  The physicians here have always been top notch  Appointments are easy to make  Appointments usually start on or around the original start time  Overall this facility is as good as the physicians staffing it ,?
820537,Dean was awesome! He was very patient and thorough  Were buying our first home  and Dean took the time to walk us through everything  including how to maintain different things and what we could do to fix the issues found  My dad came with us to give additional perspective  and he was impressed as well  Hopefully we wont be moving again anytime soon  but if we do  well definitely use WIN again for our inspection ,?
821174,Dear God what happened to this place  everyone looks and acts miserable and the food quality is truck stop variety and quality now,?
821397,Dear Lord   who has been reviewing this place?  Went there for their quote unquote BEST CRAB    more like crap   They are small legs of crab  cut in half  as dry as jerky and there was something gritty on them   SERIOUSLY?  Place is nice enough looking  service was personable  but the food was not worth the price of admission   I worry that this restaurant YELPING is fixed ,?
822013,Dear YCs I have a confession  I cheated on you   with Genghis Grill near Arrowhead Towne Center  I promise you  it meant nothing to me  Actually  it made me appreciate you even more  As we silently ate our flavorless bowls we thought about you the whole time  We missed your large portions and comforting smells  I also missed your lower prices  Your sauce selection is perfect and I love how your meats are frozen and thinly sliced  I never had a problem filling my bowl with your fresh vegetables and delicious meats  but had to try Genghis because it is closer to my house  I will never make that mistake again   I will drive to you  happily  Will you forgive me? We will never  ever stray again  In the world of Mongolian BBQ  you are everything to me  Yours Truly Kevin PS you should open a location near the 101/17   there are tens of thousands of us up here that would appreciate it ,?
822348,Dear winos I have been here numerous times and the only disappointment I ever faced was their deep fried tapas   Now taste wise  everything I ever had was pretty darn delicious   Just avoid the calamari and grilled cheese   soaked in oil!  Besides that downfall  they change up the menu ever month and always have a huge selection of wine  I definitely recommend this wine bar for a couple or tasting since they offer wine tasting with a good price   Yes  you should go   get their goat cheese  its always my first choice and always so delicious! Mmm,?
822482,Debs desserts are incredibly creative and so delicious! Have used her on many occasions including a graduation party  a birthday party  a baby shower  and more  Her sensational creations are always a WOW experience! From cakes to cake pops to cookies and cupcakes  she will match any theme no matter how unique and challenging  and she will surprise and delight  Wonderful experience ordering time and time again  Cant wait for the next celebration!,?
822700,Debbie is wonderful  Nice area  excellent service  good pricing  Returning customer  Couldnt ask for more ,?
823223,Decent Bagels  I normally jump in here on my way to work and they definitely do some good business so it isnt just me They say they do Montreal style thinner bagels but the ones ive had are usually a bit doughier and would be more NY style than Montreal Good overall though ,?
823493,Decent Italian food  One of the better restaurants in NYNY  Lines are usually long thought  Not sure why  Typical Il Fornaio food  Expensive Italian food  Good place for lunch; cant say its good for dinner  Wine list can be improved ,?
824568,Decent burger  even better fries  Lousy service  waitress hardly came to check on us and the burgers took a long time  And they charge $2 to split a burger but wont even plate it separately for you  Thats kind of ridiculous ,?
824953,Decent coffee shop set in an old pharmacy  The space is really historic  though quite dark  so maybe not ideal for working  There are some tables and chairs outside where people were enjoying coffee with their dogs  I had a scone and it was awful  dry and poor in flavor  My husbands muffin wasnt much better  The coffee was alright  nothing better than I would make at home  So while Im glad I tried it  I likely wont return  Its worth a visit for the ambiance and coffee if nothing else ,?
825816,Decent food but nothing spectacular  We made a log journey to get here and both my wife and I said while good  it wasnt worth the long trip The Margarita was very small and was gone in a couple sips  Could not taste any alcohol at all One item of note   I had tacos and the shells looked like boxed shells  I was expecting some fresh fried shells on the crunchy tacos but no such luck Good place to eat if youre in the area but definitely dont go out of your way to find this place ,?
826021,Decent food have a variety of choices and fast service   i like their Vietnamese sandwiches and also the soups,?
826101,Decent food well prepared  Hostess is not welcoming  but wait staff is kind and eager to please  Will most definitely try again ,?
826452,Decent food  incredibly slow service  :(  Came for lunch  Only a few patrons  Disappointed ,?
828178,Decent pizza   Awesome mozzarella sticks and great customer service ,?
828251,Decent place for Chinese Take out I ordered the chicken balls with rice   Good  fresh taste   Rice was cook well Price was very good for the amount of food Will come back again ,?
828359,Decent place for happy hour  Used to come here with colleagues after work  Sushi & drinks are cheaper during happy hour    only reason we used to come here  Sushi and cooked Japanese stuff arent that great  Go across the street to Ra at Kierlands if you dont mind paying and get better service ,?
828794,Decent place  I was craving a bowl of ramen  I ordered the spicy miso base  It was ok  by decidedly not spicy  Flavor was pretty good  but not great   The gyoza I ordered were excellent  and service was very prompt and friendly  Maybe I should have just ordered a different ramen base  but the experience was decent overall ,?
828917,Decent price for Wednesday  $59 on priceline   TI adds a resort fee of $25 so it was $85 total   Lady at the checkin counter was very polite and friendly   Room was recently remodeled and very clean   Nice linens/pillows   Only issue was no ironing board  pretty minor though   Casino had a decent crowd for a Wednesday   $10$15 min blackjack   Didnt play any slots   Drinks came around fairly often   Seemed to always have a drink in hand  Gilleys had free mud wrestling   Phos Vietnamese restaurant was decent   Overall pretty pleased with our stay at TI ,?
828977,Decent prices   very friendly staff   but most importantly great food  The yelp deal also a steal ,?
829187,Decent quality steaks and food   They cook it to my specifications  but I wasnt really blown away by the taste   Prices are also a little on the high side  but I use a $25 restaurant com certificate whenever I come to bring the price down to a reasonable level   The big highlight for me are the chocolate covered strawberries that they give you with the check ,?
829656,Decent service  good food  massive portions The usual Keg ,?
829708,Decent service  The food was average! Typical pasta dishes that could be made at home! $$$,?
829734,Decent shop with limited options  Prices are decent but no left handed holsters  Staff is very knowledgeable with guns and tactics ,?
830261,Decent tapioca and drink but cashier service completely abolished my otherwise decent experience  While I was about to pay and had my card out  the cashier asked if I had cash instead  I could see that their card machine was working perfectly fine and such a question was pretty illmannered to begin with but I figured sure why not  Asians love their cash and Ill do a good deed  I had $37 in change  got a $20 bill and $17 loonies  yea no  ,?
831069,Decided I wanted to get a haircut last minute  I do not live in Canada and had never been to Calgary  but was finishing up a trip through the parks in Alberta so I used yelp and stumbled upon notorious  I decided to give it a shot and messaged the business through yelp to set up an appointment  The owner got back to me super quick and bam  was scheduled for a couple hours later  The decor was really cool and the people were very laidback  I really enjoyed my experience here and the stylist  She was super easy to talk to and listened when I told her how I felt about the cut she gave  I couldnt even put into words what I was thinking  but she understood what I was trying to say and made the cut even better  A few days later  and Im still super happy with how it turned out :) Would highly recommend Notorious!,?
831119,Decided go here because it was near home  I regret every bit of it  These guys are in it for the money and like to charge for this and that  I spent a grip for my services here and my ass was still hurting  So I ended up going back to my old Dr @ Mountain Podiatry @ Summerlin Medical center  They fixed me once before and they fixed me again and didnt blow money left and right  Its funny how I told my Dr there that I had a bad experience at another Dr  She said let me guess you went to Absolute Foot Care  That just tells you they already have a bad repretation  I will continue to go to Mountain Poditary because there  services there is 2nd 2 None REAL TALK !,?
831393,Decided to change it up from the usual place  Definitely impressed  I setup an appointment online and got a response within 15 minutes with a next day booking  Awesome!Upon arrival I got a Sierra Nevada in my hand within 2 minutes and sunk into a deep leather chair  Cool aesthetic in this place  Dark woods  Leather  Definitely felt at home in a mens salon for the first time  Tabatha did a great job with my overgrown curly hair  And gave me something more updated  She took my garbled ideas for a haircut and made some great suggestions  Hot towel  Head massage and shampoo were fantastic  Definitely recommend this place  A little more than what I usually spend but definitely worth it!!,?
832328,Decided to do something different and try this out  Loved the experience  preparing for the zombie apocalypse ;) My boyfriend now wants this in his backyard  Got a groupon  which was a better deal  The instructor was fun and helped you master your technique  2 hours for 2 people seemed like a lot of time but was just enough to enjoy thoroughly  Definitely therapeutic when you feel like throwing something!,?
832725,Decided to give Niji a try again  on a Saturday evening around 7pm  They were pretty packed  and I had a bitter taste in my mouth from my past experience  I was surprised! They were fast  customer service was definitely improved they even did a food satisfaction check  I ordered beef Terriyaki  and now its served on a plate vs a stone sizzling plate which I like so the meat doesnt over cook  This bimbimbap wasnt great  but I ordered it not expecting much from it since I was at a sushi place  The Green Dragon Roll was just as good as I remembered! And the shrimp tempura was fresh out of the deep fryer! The waitress topped up my tea  and brought the complimentary miso soup  salad  small porridge  and green tea ice cream without having to be asked! I was happy that they didnt try to tell me it was $1  Prices have slightly gone up  but thats a given from 5 years ago  I will definitely be coming back more often ,?
834143,Decided to pick up my tickets to Pagliacci / Gianni Schicchi at the COA administration office because for some reason I dont trust the mail  As soon as I walk in  I am greeted by this powerful female voice of someone practicing  lts beautiful and a very pleasant surprise  Immediately to my right upon entering is a door where the box office is located  I expected there to be glass windows with a small hole in it to make the exchange like at a movie theater  but it was just an office  It was weird waiting in an office while the secretary was finishing his phone call before getting my tickets  The gentleman greeted me and proceeded to print off tickets from a small printer next to his desk and voila I was now opera bound   I think I would come back to pick up my tickets again  That beautiful practice voice makes the effort worthwhile 15/30 Yelp 30 Day Challenge,?
835295,Decided to try another Vietnamese restaurants mango shrimp salad with pho  and for the price of this  there definitely wasnt enough shrimps or mangos  The tamarind sauce tasted good  But the shrimps were peeled in halfs and scattered sparingly on top of a lack of mango slices They would get 2 stars if not for the super nice service ,?
835738,Decided to try the place out after reading all the positive feedback    ordered sesame chicken with rice  orange chicken with rice and a chicken lo main    all the dishes tasted the same and very bland    the lo main was very overcooked    the chicken was pretty good in all the dishes but just so bland     I mean no flavors whats so ever    why the big hype about this place  I dont know   ,?
836168,Decided to try this place for late lunch today  My husband really loved the onion rings  thought they were the best hes had for a long time   The burgers were good  but we both thought they wernt quite as good as In n Out  and they are pricier than In N Out  Next time it will most likely be In N Out ,?
836712,Decided to try this spot for dinner after the gym last week  The create your own meal lets you select a protein  starch  veggie and sauce from a fairly extensive list  The food was well cooked  healthy (steamed  not fried   when applicable)  and the sauce was fantastic  I love a menu with good vegan/vegetarian food and options! It was fairly priced  the staff was helpful and the place was clean  My only quasinegative is they seem to be a little slow for takeout  However  this is probably them still getting up to speed  Nice plus  complementary water flavored with citrus and cucumber  It was a nice touch ,?
837826,Deecent  clean place for rehearsals  No 5 star rating for the lack of cold AC when its over 100 degrees  which can be often here in Chandler  Helpful and friendly front desk Dudes make this place a winner  Excellent (guitar) gear available  so you dont have to haul your own stuff ,?
838294,Def dropping my rating after a few recent experiences  Bad meat 2x in one week?? Really?? Nope  never buying meat from here again  Had bad pork ribs last week  and I just returned a rack of beef back ribs I was getting ready to season for the smoker  To top it off  the girl I returned it to could tell I was pretty peeved  especially having this happen 2x this week  so she went and grabbed a manager  Well he was an apathetic waste of space  seemed intimidated and afraid to say anything  All he could mutter is im sorry  Ya know what  at this point that was not good enough  If you were truly sorry this wouldnt have happened again!!! Anyone have any good butcher recommendations in the Weddington/Stallings area?? Done with this over priced  monopolized grocery store ,?
838727,Definetly the prettiest buffet in Vegas  We came in on a Sunday night  and after waiting for about 20 minutes we were seated  The waiters were polite  and didnt seem to hate their job like a lot of buffet waiters seem to do  They have several stations  more than any other buffet Ive been to in Vegas  but they dont have the biggest selection of dishes  Thats not a problem though  because the food is definetly the best Ive ever had at a Vegas buffet  The dessert selection was also great  At 84 USD (after tax) for two adults for dinner  I really cant complain  and if you like seafood/shellfish youll definetly get a lot of bang for your buck  They also have endless wine/Bud Light packaged for 16 USD ,?
838989,Definitely Recommend to anyone! It was such a great experience and we were able to find out the babys gender accurately before the 20 weeks anatomy scan  The staff was all very friendly and it was a very laid back  cozy and friendly atmosphere  I wish I would have known about this place with my first pregnancy!,?
840430,Definitely a must try! Im a huge fan of delicious coffee and this place has it! I actually received a free drink email for a small pumpkin spice latte and thats what drove me in  Upon arrival  I was greeted with a smile  The latte was actually amazing  I subbed almond milk instead of their default and so glad I did  The texture was super smooth and the flavor was semisweet  which was exactly what I was looking for  Will be back!,?
840515,Definitely a new  untrained crew at Chipotle  doesnt seem to be too many transfers of knowledgeable employees from other locations   Portion sizes of protein have been extremely small and have to nudge the team for more of every ingredient   Frustrating  but tasty ,?
841571,Definitely coming back here for lunch   The stuff is extremely friendly and are ready to give the best service    They deliver and are open 7 days a week ! Check this place out if youre looking to try some amazing Mediterranean food ,?
841690,Definitely deserves more than 3 5 stars  Marche Bacchus is a great wine shop and bistro nestled on the lake  Highly recommended for a great wine selection and French appetizers ,?
842394,Definitely have had a rough start to my lease  Started with poor communication by my leasing agent Tatiana  who caused many delays and left horrendous unit conditions to move into  My experience has definitely been saved by dealing with Sharese who has helped with expediting all work orders and really getting my apartment to living order! Thank you Sharese for all of your help  kindness  and efficiency!,?
843085,Definitely my favourite health food store in Toronto  and trust me Ive been to the majority of them  Their bulk section is endless and the prices are great  The staff is so friendly and obviously passionate and knowledgable about the shop and its products  They have taken into account all aspects of making the experience as lowwaste as possible  as they support bringing your own bags and containers to stock up on the bulk items  and if not  they have paper bags that you can use  One of my favourite places in Toronto!,?
843126,Definitely my go to for a fill I prefer Amy and Harvey but everyone there does a wonderful job  Ive never had a bad experience so far ,?
843461,Definitely not a store to purchase Mens Suits!You are only allowed to buy what Macys wants you to buy   Not what YOU want to buy  The customer is definitely wrong when wanting to spend money in this establishment ,?
843504,Definitely not as great as everyone plays it out to be   Very average place with drinks that are a little too pricey for their location   trying to be super trendy but end up being a total poser bar   would not recommend it,?
843614,Definitely not impressed by this store   I came in today because I needed 2 banners that say Congratulations   Immediately when Im less than 5 feet in the door we ask the 2 people working there  one being a manager or owner I believe  and they immediately said no   The manager then went down the aisle to double check and confirmed that they do not I went to Party City after and while they didnt have exactly what I was looking for they showed me the personalized banners you could buy My friend who had gotten there before me and had the opportunity to walk around the store said the shelves looked empty and mentioned that they didnt have anything Trolls themed which is in right now and she was looking for Being a small business you should show your customers options to get business rather than say no and scare them out of the store; especially when we were the only two people in the store ,?
844307,Definitely one of my favorite local places   The food is always amazing and the cheap car bombs always make it a fun time   Both the Tempe and Mesa locations have their own unique charm and the staff is always great!,?
844468,Definitely one of my favourite places in Toronto  Food and drinks are amazing and you dont walk away with too steep of a bill! Definitely recommend!,?
844800,Definitely one of the best places to eat in Rock Hill  The layout of the restaurant is unique in its own way  Food was excellent  Chelsea  one of the waitresses   provided exquisite service  Will definitely return ,?
846865,Definitely unforgettable  We celebrated our 5 year anniversary and requested a 5 layer cake  each layer a different color in the shape of a 5pointed star  We got a misshapen attempt at a star with white layers and 3 colors of icing in between  The points of the star were almost entirely icing  What a joke! Who cant draw a star?? Thank goodness we were not having a party and counting on this as our showpiece!,?
847021,Definitely will go to HatClub again! Called prior to my trip there since I wanted to make sure they had what I needed  Chris answered and was very friendly! He definitely knew what I was looking for and was able to help answer my questions When I stopped by to buy the hat I needed they were very friendly  Not to mention I walked in there probably 25 minutes before they closed and they still were very good about it ,?
847497,Definitely worth the wait    even though it was an hour and a half  Service was great and the tacos were amazing! Tried both the beef and chicken so good! As well as the guac  cheese dip and margs!,?
847784,Defintely has  room to improve   I came away with a 50/50 experience   Loved the decor  the drop ceiling  the energy   We had the Manakish and baba ghanoush   The appetizer portions are too small for the price   I loved the cashew cheese manakish but the shitake manakish lacked seasoning   We asked for some flavor and got salt and pepper ,?
848115,Delays  delays  delays  Oh  and dont forget the hidden fees  Wouldnt be in the spirit of this airline without them,?
848305,Delicate  Simple  Delicious What I ate:Vegetarian Croissant sandwich  5 stars  the flavors and textures all work perfectly together  Croissant was a treat and worth every single calorie Green salad side  4 stars  fresh dark greens  light and fragrant balsamic dressing  simple  The take away:High quality food  excellent flavor combinations  I will be a repeat offender ,?
848653,Delicious Afghan Fast Food Style Decided To Try This Place And The Food Was Absolutely Delicious  I Ordered The Kofta Kabob Entree Which Came With Real Afghan Rice (Not The Cheap Basmati Rice) But Long Grain Afghan Rice Which Had A Nice Seasoning In It As Well Came With Afghan Naan  Salad And Dal Nakhut  The Amount Of Food You Get Is So Worth The Price!   I Couldnt Finish Half Of It And Saved It For Later The Man At The Counter Was Friendly  Takes A Little Time To Get Your Food But Its Because They Make It Fresh  I Would Rather Have Good Quality Food And Wait Than Have Pre Made And Fast I Will Definitely Will Be Going There Again And Try The Spicy Burger!,?
849120,Delicious Hakka food; highly recommend the hot n sour soup  crispy chili beef and Indonesian fried rice! The service is good  Ive been going here for the past 3 years and the quality of the food has been consistent  Prices are great for the amount of food you get and Ive found it to be a clean place ,?
849181,Delicious Indian food that you get instantly  no wait  Try everything here its all amazing  Masala Dosa with buttermilk is delicious,?
849321,Delicious Korean BBQ their menu is very authentic   They have all of the fresh meat on display  which makes for a unique experience!  Service was great  atmosphere was very nice and clean   We will definitely return ,?
849477,Delicious Mexican iced coffees!! When I feel like treating myself  I grab one of these after work before going to sit in traffic on the 10  They are a bit of a splurge ($6 xx for a medium) but the woman who works there is so kind to chat with while the drink is being prepared  It is a quaint location ,?
849662,Delicious Ramen  what else can I say??? Well for one expect to wait a while when trying to snag lunch here even during the week  I was in line to be seated foe 20 minutes on  Tuesday  This place was a secret a few years back but now your gonna wait in line to get your mitts on a nice big bowl of spicy ramen  The extra spicy will wreck your day later  trust me lol  But all the ingredients are fresh and the miso base is my favorite Ramen go to here  Give this place a try if your not in a pinch for time  for a nice hot bowl of a college favorite done the right way!,?
850588,Delicious and fun!SkinnyFATS is a one stop solution for any craving healthy or not  The food is delicious and the presentation is neat and fun!,?
850869,Delicious and quick/helpful service  The drive thru is very convenient  The peppers are a bit on the super hot side ,?
851071,Delicious and very affordable food! You get green tea and miso soup when you are seated  Dinner time is always busy  so expect a line up at the door  The line is usually fast  the longest I had to wait was 15 minutes  The service is okay  not excellent or bad but Im not complaining because its so cheap and the food is soo good  Their bento boxes and dinners can fill you up for about $1215 max  When I get the salmon teriyaki dinner  you can hear it steaming still as they bring it to you  Thats when you know its made fresh and hasnt been sitting there for too long  I dont know about their sushi since I dont eat sushi  With most meals  you get free ice cream (green tea  mango or red bean flavour) when youre done  If you dont want to be literally sitting right beside someone then dont sit on the 2nd floor  The tables are so close together  If the 2nd floor is the only one available  I wait until a table is empty on the first ,?
851099,Delicious and very friendly and welcoming!  This was our first attempt at Poke here on the mainland and stopped here on a whim   Fresh fish  great selection of toppings and helpful services Ted that explained everything!,?
851279,Delicious authentic Belgian waffles!! Perfect late nighT treat! I take my waffles without all the add ins but if you are looking to indulge I would recommend the Nutella   they are open till 11 pm Saturday night so might want to update the hours listed on yelp      ,?
851550,Delicious barbeque!! The corn bread was amazing  soft and moist  and it was unlimited  This location was so far but Im glad they recently opened one location relatively close to me  Best BBQ in Arizona so far!,?
852581,Delicious chicken Pad Thai! I got medium spicy and it is the perfect amount of spice for me  My boyfriend got the very spicy Thai soup and it has a real kick! The vegan and gluten free options are a great bonus! Ill be back soon!,?

853523,Delicious discovery just off Central at Vernon  Family hospitality with an excellent beer and wine list  Enjoyed the Burata and the mushroom appetizers Ribs and Augustine potatoes were great  Its a hidden gem with good parking and a patio you can enjoy with friends ,?
853687,Delicious drinks! I like getting them in regular glasses and in those huuuuuge vats where you put 1 000 000 straws and 10 people gather around to get a good swig The music can be a bit loud (so dont come here on a Friday or Saturday night to have a chat)  but thats all part of the fun ,?

854223,Delicious food and a must if youre in Montreal  Come in hungry bc youll get a rich and hearty meal  We ordered the infamous duck in a can  mushroom tortellini (tonites special)  the steamed dumplings & plogue a Champlain foie gras breakfast  which was the highlight of the night  buckwheat pancake   thick Canadian bacon  potatoes and cheese topped with foie gras  I wish it was one of the earlier items delivered I would have enjoyed a few more bites  Would def come here with a group to be able to taste more items on the menu  Its a busy restaurant so do make reservations  We scored 9:30 pm reservations on a Sunday night and place was packed with ppl still coming in with reservations after us  Service was slow and we had a really long wait b/t entrees coming out  We didnt leave until after 11:30  Luckily for us  our toddler was still on California time and was cooperative ,?

857783,Delicious food  Horrible Service and Slow to get meals out to you   Id only return for carryout ,?
857792,Delicious food  I especially like the Bao and the Banh Mi  The fries are decent  as are the kimchi fries  but neither one really stands out for me  and Id probably always pick a bao over a taco They are busy during most mealtimes  so plan accordingly ,?
857850,Delicious food  Love collecting the glass beer glasses at every hard rock cafe  We went in May of 2015 and headed to the bar after having a filling lunch  We struck up a conversation with the bartender who was friendly and probably intrigued because we were asking about downlow places in town like The Laundry Room  She ended up giving us a round on her  Loved or experience there especially the Vegas friendliness from the bartender!,?
858148,Delicious fresh big sashimi   Even the sushi (just fish on rice) is tasty cause they give you a big piece of fish on there  Ive tried the bibimbap and its delicious (they use fried egg instead of raw here)   I love the purple rice for everything  The sashimi salad bowls are delicious and filling on their own  Still havent tried the rolls  Will need to experiment more Minus 1 for not having an option to order just sashimi with no sushi  And cause the sushi/sashimi plates are only available in large sharing sizes  not individual ,?
858454,Delicious gourmet crepes  Friendly staff  Awesome environment  Price is right  Eat here  its good ,?

859298,Delicious lunch shared here with my mom who is visiting  from  Canada  She said it was the best!,?
859580,Delicious middle eastern food at a very reasonable price  Good selection of wine and a nice quiet place to grab lunch or dinner    You can actually carry a conversation with the party you are dining with as there is no unnecessary loud noise Open late and you really cant go wrong with anything you order    Family owned with warm service    Highly recommend!,?
860139,Delicious pizza!  A friendly and caring staff who really cares about your enjoyment of the food   My husband and I had the best pizza date night   The pizza was fresh  and tasted great  Even getting there just 1 hour before closing we didnt feel rushed  The staff was warm and friendly; added plus   the pizza was delicious!  Koodoos   well  be back!,?
860403,Delicious pizza  Unfriendly staff  Deliciousness of pizza outweighs unfriendliness of staff ,?
860519,Delicious popcorn! So many flavors to choose from! If you have to get a gift  for someone  this is unique! Bosss Day  Teachers Day  Secretarys Day  Valentines Day  Holiday gifts for the person you know little about or the person who has everything! Sport tins to choose from  or little bags that fit into gift boxes  Add some sweet taffy and well la! You are a thoughtful gift giver!,?
860524,Delicious porchetta sandwich with eggplant & hot peppers   Worth a stop  you wont be disappointed!,?
860873,Delicious sandwich but they messed it up and I got two eggs and no sausage   Got here at 8 am on a Friday and it took about 20 minutes to get through the line but they have the dance club music pumping so it was cool  Just dont be in a hurry   If I were staying here I would come back as it is pretty reasonable for being in the hotel  Cool place ,?
861128,Delicious shrimp wontons! Each bite is full of shrimp that is perfectly cooked  For the price of these  you definitely cant go wrong  Ps  Love the chilli oil too,?
861335,Delicious steak and fun concept  would recommend to anyone  Came here with coworkers as an outing event and we all enjoyed it ,?
861564,Delicious sushi   Try the robata grill for a deviation from the average   Sitting at the bar is fun and highly recommended ,?
861572,Delicious sushi  Ive been an avid sushi fan for more than ten years  and OMG Sushi serves the freshest and tastiest sushi Ive had! Las Vegas is very hitormiss with sushi; you either find a restaurant with great food  but poor service  or a restaurant with great service  but average food  OMG Sushi is the only sushi restaurant Ive had where each roll tasted delicious and was incredibly fresh (especially the nigiri!!) This place is a MUST for AYCE sushi!,?
862098,Delicious vegetarian and vegan options from dinner to dessert to drinks! Our table shared the nachos (amazing sauce & beans) and I tried the sweet potato & avocado quesadillas which were great  albeit a touch too sweet  My favourite part however was the MatchaPassionfruit cake with chia icing which was light and refreshing and a perfect end to the meal! Next time I will definitely visit to share a halfplate of nachos since the portions were huge and at a great price!,?
862176,Delicious way to start off the day! Had the French toast with a glass of their iced matcha on this visit  Both were really good and well presented  I really enjoyed the ambiance of the restaurant as well  Many more visits are planned for the near future ,?
862509,Delicious!  And easy on the wallet compared to other good sushi joints   Very small  quaint yet comfortable location   Glad we have another option in Henderson  especially one that my kids enjoy too   Well be going back ,?
862655,Delicious!  I highly recommend the Italian sausage on pizza  they use ground sausage which is different  and so good!  The waffle fries are always fresh and not soggy when we get them  and the garlic bread is huge and extra crispy   Absolutely love this place!,?
863089,Delicious! Best caramel macchiato I have ever had! Perfect balance Spinach  egg  onion and cheese bagel was delish and fresh ,?
863219,Delicious! Delicious! Delicious!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!They serve some of the best tacos Ive ever had here and you know it before you walk in  everyone eating there is Mexican  The corn tacos they used were the softest Ive ever had  None of that previously frozen dry cardboard tasting stuff You can choose from a variety of delicious meats  we tried the beef stomach and pork intestine unknowingly (the man behind the counter only told us what it was after we ate it)  They were pretty delicious but Im wimp when it comes to weird meat  I forget what else they have but we ended up picking al pastor and the chorizo  both delicious as well They topped the tacos off with different sauces and gave us a small cut of the pineapple that was roasting on their rotary grill on one of our tacos  :)We tried some of the other stuff too (all delicious) but the tacos are the star of the restaurant ,?
863553,Delicious! Great variety of breakfast dishes  From different benedicts to a variety of scrambles and omelets  Also non egg dishes like french toast and burgers and sandwiches  Have the country potatoes  theyre seasoned and cut into perfect bite sizes  Well worth the 20 minute wait,?
864355,Delicious! Ordered the Gaeng Dang with shrimp and highly recommend! Authentic Thai flavoring with generous portions  Our new go to Thai restaurant!,?
864450,Delicious! Service and Atmosphere were perfect! Of coarse this is the Wynn and wouldnt expect anything less  Our food came out promptly and hot  Even charged our phones for us while we dined  Had Sweet & Sour Chicken  Shrimp Fried Rice  and BBQ SpareRibs!! Bomb!! One of my new Favorites in LV !,?
864658,Delicious! The hubby and I were on our way to Phoenix and took a road out of the way  We found this place on Yelp and stopped in to check it out   great choice  The restaurant was clean and simple  the service was great and the food was delicious  I ordered a small Caesar salad  an absolute favorite of mine if done right  This one was perfect  We shared the Calzone   the perfect size for two  It was made with ricotta cheese which made it even better  the taste and texture of the cheese  sausage  mushrooms was different and delicious  I would definitely recommend this yummy spot ,?
864786,Delicious! They have a small menu and the beef tendon noodle soup is only available on weekends  I got a small beef noodle and my boyfriend got a large the size difference is ridiculous! Theyre very generous in their portions and small was definitely more than enough for me  The noodles are great  chewy  I got the two xi size which I think is prefect; boyfriend got the three xi and it was a bit too thick  Highly recommended!!,?
865263,Delicious!! A group of 8 went here last night  and we were immediately greeted by two smiling  friendly employees   Immediately I noticed how clean the restaurant is  and how delicious the food cooking at other tables smelled  Once we ordered the all you can eat  two ladies brought out a huge plate of beef briscut and thinly sliced beef tongue  as well as so many side dishes  salads  and appetizers! Our tables were full! The salad with the ginger and apples dressing is yummy  with a little spicy kick   The seasoned cucumbers were one of my favorites  along with the miso soup   The miso paste/sauce is my fav  and the meat tasted great! So tender  and juicy  and the meat plates kept coming! Im thankful I had my Korean friend with us to explain dishes and order  but the waitresses were nice and spoke english   The best meat was the thin marinated beef!! A must try!!!!!!! I will be back here once a month!,?
865283,Delicious!! Be ready to wait a bit though if you go in the evening hours! But its so worth it  All the meat is super flavorful and tender  Probably some of the best KBBQ Ive had  Two people can fill their bellies with 50$  We didnt do a special  we just picked 6 or 7 meats and some rice and were very happy!,?
865505,Delicious!! The tacos are outstanding  The fried fish and the pulled pork were my favorites  The service was extremely fast and the chips and salsa was very tasty ,?
865607,Delicious!!!  Between my family of 4 we have probably tried most of the menu items at Sauce   My daughters (5 yrs and 3 yrs) love the pizza and pasta with meatballs   I hope Sauce comes out with more specials like the Summer Deal  $20 for pizza  salad and wine   My favorite items so far are the Meatball Sandwich and the Chicken and Broccoli and cheese sauce   I need to find out where Sauce gets the side pepper that comes with the Meatball Sandwich   If you like peppers ask for an extra one as the peppers are really good (not spicy but sweet)   Can you tell I am a HUGE fan of Sauce?  If someone knows where I can buy those peppers let me know?,?
866342,Delicious  cheap water & fast  friendly service! We purchased a cooler here along with two (2) 5 gal water jugs   We got 50 free gallons of water with our cooler purchase which is a nice discount  You can also purchase $15 water cards  which makes a 5 gallon jug only $1 50 to fill instead of $2 00   Definitely check it out  Its cheaper than purchasing most plastic bottled waters and youre avoiding a ton of plastic waste ,?
866682,Delicious  fresh food  great service and comfortable environment   I was a little bit worried about where we would park but it turned out that parking couldnt have been easier   I want to go to Steenbocks again on my next trip to Madison ,?
867138,Delicious  quick and inexpensive! The concept is similar to Chipotle style where you choose your sauce  toppings and cheese  They also have several options they have already created  I was with two other people and we got the Austin (Bbq chicken) and made our own with sausage and peppers with red sauce  Just those two pizzas and a cookie was great to share and only $23  They were ready in about 3 minutes and tasted great and so fresh!The customer service was wonderful too  Everyone seemed to really be enjoying their job and they even brought the pizza out to us when it was done and cleaned up our plates while we sat and talked  We headed there before seeing a movie at the theatre right behind it  Worked out great! Wonderful spot for lunch!,?
867362,Delicious l food  beautiful location fit for a wedding  kind and helpful staff  a must return ,?
868262,Delicious  The dumplings were yummy  obviously  However  what we gobbled up even more quickly was the stir fried vegetables  Tasty and good for you  Its a bit more expensive than I expected  after all  we were in Chinatown  But alas  it was what it was ,?
868496,Delicious   Service was great  food came out in a timely manner  Nice breakfast on the patio  Had the classic skillet and the corn beef hash skillet  Both were very good  Needed to go  boxes   see you next week ,?
870004,Delivered pretty much fully open which means they will be dead in less than two days certainly not something I wouldve spent my money on   Never again ,?
871400,Dennis  my partner and I  call this The Pig Restaurant as they have so many little ceramic pigs that decorate the dining room  I love this tiny restaurant in the heart of the gay village!Open 24 hrs  this French Quebec cafe has everything from soups  sandwiches  poutine  great coffee  braised beef and carrots  hamburger steak  homemade desserts  yummy breakfasts  and so much more  I love it that I can have all choices at any time  Prices are cheap  cheap  cheap!,?
871927,Depends where you eat  but they may be able to validate some of your parking fee  Parking is somewhere between $1923 per day in this garage  but way less for a few hours  Its one of the only garages in Station Square unless you want to park in a lot down past the Grand Concourse  Ive heard you can reserve a spot online for this garage ,?
872233,Derek stayed late to help us pick a mattress and got us a great deal  He didnt rush us at all  The mattress should last us another 30 years  but if this place is still around when it bites the dust  well come back ,?
872447,Descend Service  food is above expectation  able to serve dish that are not on menu to cater   Will go back again   Their best are their risotto   Very rich and favorable ,?
872492,Descent food with healthy options like a Panera Bread cross with Subway style of ordering and preparation  Good value with good amount of options  Recommends for those looking for a quick bite and time constraint people need to get in and head out  The service is really consistent and friendly  Dont forget to order a fountain drink which allows you to be a mixologist opposed to their ready to grab bottle drinks at the front counter ,?
873745,Despite being a long time NASCAR fan and enjoying trips to the Hall of Fame  I will no longer be able to do so   Their decision to prohibit concealed carry permit holders from carrying their concealed weapons puts them at high risk for crime   That sign informs criminals that they will be the only people there carrying a weapon and that makes them an easy target   I will not support a business that takes away my right to defend myself  my family and those around me   They have nothing to fear from concealed handgun permit holders who  by virtue of training and background checks  have proven themselves sane  sober and lawabiding ,?
876166,Deville Dinerbar  how I love you! We love the modern yet retro decor  and the presentation of the food was beautiful! We loved everything we ordered  and the service we received was on par  I split the Bad Girl pasta with a friend and didnt get any nasty looks from the waiter  :) He couldnt have been nicer! And the pasta was divine perfection huge chunks of seafood and plenty of pasta  Great location  too    we will be sure to stop here every time we are in Montreal!,?
877227,Did pizza night with our friends and tried Martini Pizza   Not greasy  great dough  not soggy at all!  Great pizza  wiht loads of cheese   Well definitely give them a call again!!!,?
877309,Did I get hustled into buying sheets  yeah kinda  Am I THAT upset about it? No  Will I go buy more sheets from here  for sure NOT  But this may be a personal preference  They pushed the fact that these were 1500 threat count  but does that even matter when theyre micro fiber sheets? I feel like they dont let me breath  Like if I lay in the same spot i feel like they make me sweat almost They are soft  feel smooth  nice  decent quality  But overall they arent really worth the $99 buy one get one deal they offer  They also pushed the wrinkle free idk I guess I could care less if they wrinkle or not  but they did for the record  My boyfriend loves them though  so truly its a matter of opinion  but I wanted to write the review to point out there hustle game which is a tad bit on the shady side  The sales lady almost even got an attitude when I asked how long they had been a company  and a little history on them  I respect their game  but I wont return ,?
877733,Did a great job and price was lowest of 8 estimates I received   They were punctual and customer service was great ,?
878015,Did a pineapple olives and spicy fennel sausage pizza was danklicious! Guy makin pizzas was super polite  funny and for workin solo banged the pizzas out  Will be back for the chicago style  If i may make one suggestion  get some wings!,?
878342,Did anyone actually eat the food here  or are they just reviewing how pretty it looks?  4 5 star yelp review   walking distance from our hotel   One $ sign   I had to try it   We got there and hubby got a ham and cheese croissant and I got a savory crepe   Both were nasty   Husbands croissant was a greasy mess   No pockets of air filled in his croissant at all  My crepe was thick  bland  and a waste of calories   $20 for a ham and cheese croissant  crepe  and a coffee   1 5 hours wasted in Vegas   1 000 calories wasted in my belly  :(,?
878978,Did not have a reservation but showed up for New Years Day Brunch  We had  Omelets which were great and the Fruit I substituted for a potato was fresh and a generous portion  Great atmosphere and good service despite the seemingly large number of people that showed up at the same time ,?
879067,Did not know this place existed   From the reviews  Ill drive up there today ,?
880468,Did you know they have dropped the Chicago Dog?  Always ordered that  as husband likes the steakburgers and chili mac   Very disappointed that the Chicago Dog is gone!  Liked the taste of the grilled dog!So  now in addition to not being able to get the Chicago Dog   cant order a regular hot dog    they dont have sweet relish  anymore!!   How hard is it to have relish on hand for hot dogs??Nothing for me there  anymore  except the shakes!,?
880753,Didnt dine in  but rather took out and carried away  The  pizzas were great got a large meatlovers and their Hawaiian (kids love it)  The price was a little high  but quality was worth it  Great ingredients and the wings were great too  I only carried out so cant give a full review here  but customer service seemed on and I could see them tossing pizza while I made my purchase  Will be fun for family  Will definitely dine in or out again ,?
880824,Didnt eat here  Walked in about 4:15 on 36  four employees counting money and talking to each other  Im the only customer  No hello  no  I will be with you in a minute  No eye contact  I waited five minutes then walked out  Why do you have four employees?  Youre wasting your money ,?
880913,Didnt even get a chance to taste the food   Horrible service and waited for 30 minutes to have them screw up the order   Nobody ever came and let us know how long the food was going to take or check on us   Would not wait anymore and when I talked with the Manager he didnt listen   Attitudes from all the employees were bad and I wish Gordon Ramsay was there so I could fire him!,?
881633,Didnt have high hopes for the food or service so I wasnt too disappointed  As a movie theatre  the seats are comfy and there is plenty of room  As a restaurant  the food is subpar and the service was questionable  I do admit I was pleasantly surprised with the prices  I purchased a groupon so my ticket was only 5 bucks  plus a $10 pizza  The pizza was pretty bad  but again  low expectations Makes sure you bring your parking ticket to get validated!! I forgot and was out $10  Bummer ,?
881716,Didnt have to wait long to place a take out order  The All Star Special was worth the money & enough food for two people  Crystal took my order  She delivered great customer service ,?
882598,Didnt see anything remarkable here but I did drop off a beautiful pendant lamp that the volunteers liked   Lovely volunteers work here  Hope that the inventory gets a little more interesting on future visits  Great cause  Happy to support it ,?
883212,Diego has amazing chips and salsa   I love salt and the flavored salt trio that came with the chips was fantastic   I ordered the chefs tasting menu and it was quite tasty   It had several different beef selections on it and each one was interesting and delicious   It was a little pricier than the average Mexican joint  but I thought it was worth it   Margarita hit the spot ,?
883398,Different from a lot of the bars I go to  the music was definitely not dancey  but the divebar aspect made the atmosphere quite relaxed and fun  A good place to go if youre trying something different but I doubt Ill go back just purely based on it not being anything out of the ordinary ,?
883700,Dig  dig  dig and donate  donate  donate You can find any and everything you could need/work with here   In fact  the desk Im typing this from is from CJ and is in perfect condition!The Big Pour doesnt hurt either ;),?
884243,Dim sum is the shit! I didnt have to eat for the rest of the day & the tea was amazing too  If you like eating delicious food with friends continuously for hours come here I came with people experienced at dim sum  & they were like my tour guides in a foreign land  I loved it & would go again in a second Go with a group of friends  get there early enough to get a table  & stuff yourself with delicious food!,?
884437,Dimmis is great casual place to eat  The food is authentic Italian  and the service is great  The pasta is fresh  I enjoy coming here  The ambiance is also very nice with the outside patio  Nice wine selection  They always have great specials  I normally avoid spaghetti in restaurants  but Dimmis the exception  cooked to perfection al Dante the sauce is fine  and the meatballs supreme   Give it a try! Well done Dimmis ,?
884468,Dimsum is so awful! Expensive and with the taste  it really is not worth it  One plate is like $46  I can go to another dimsum place for cheaper and better food  Really regret coming here  Rude waiter/ess doesnt even want to serve us  My advice is :  the best thing they have is water or else JUST DONT COME HERE!,?
884635,Dined alone and was seated in front of the kitchen  which was great  as I had a chance to speak with the kitchen staff as they prepped the food  and i also chatted with other people sitting nearby who were also dining on their own  Its a great spot for solo diners I came to Momofuku because I craved ramen  But after seeing their pork belly bao sandwich on the menu   I had to order both the ramen and the pork belly sandwich  Wow  That sandwich is so good  crispy  tasty  and delightful  Ramen is as good as other ramen Ive had (theres one ramen shop in my hometown that does it extremely well  and I go there on a regular basis  Im pleased to taste a similar dish of equal quality)  To finish the meal off  I had a tiny cup with salted / caramel chocolate ice cream with caramel cereal flakes  Highly recommended  Delicious  overall  and the service was wonderful ,?
886077,Ding Tai Fung is my goto place for whenever Im craving xiao long bao! I dont know any better places for itThis location is huge compared to the one in First Markham Place  Although its much larger  they still get packed! I usually like to come slightly before the lunch hour because thats when they get quite busy and people have to start waiting ,?
886120,Dingy bar that serves delicious fried fish and pierogies Its cheap  good and feels like Cleveland  You can almost see Anthony Bourdain there while doing his tour of blue collar Cleveland bars Go  its worthwhile ,?
886245,Dining at Crop Bistro was an allaround excellent experience phenomenal food  service  and atmosphere  The old bank provides an exquisite setting for a romantic evening with someone you love ,?
886980,Dinner for five  Walked in about 5PM noticed a half dozen people sitting in the waiting area so was prepared for a wait  Daughter in law goes to give our name  5 minutes later we were seated at a table   If that wasnt good enough before we were all seated our waitress was at the table with chips and salsa and handing out menus and taking drink orders  Server was excellent and when she saw my wife trying to get a group photo immediately took her camera and took photos for the entire group  Everything we ordered tasted great  Very prompt on bringing out appetizers  main course  drinks and dessert   Ambience is excellent  Will definitely recommend and look forward to another visit  Bill for entire group about $130  tip,?
887159,Dinner here was very good   Service was excellent and the salad bar was well stocked ,?
887197,Dinner is at 42 a pop and kids are half the price but totally wodrth the price  Great selection separates them from the rest  They are par with ceasars buffet in a creative and unique way  Gets crowded even on weekdays  Must try when in vegas ,?
887409,Dinner recently my wife and I with friends  We are not from this area and they suggested Fratellis  Very pleasant setting outside in alleyway  Attentive and very nice staff and service  Food very good  Could have been excellent except for  get this  the chef leaves off capers on veal piccata dinners   two  When we let the server know the chef was not that concerned offered a side if capers   Should have comped something  Will give them another try  Report later,?
887447,Dinner should be easy when ordering a simple 3 piece meal  After waiting for 7 mins watching my food on a plate get cold/ Im told that they have no coleslaw and then after choosing another item Im told that that the second item is not available  So I asked for my money back but they said NO    Cant give it back  Ill have to come back for another meal and get free then   BULLSHIT  DO NOT GO BACK EVER    MANAGER SHOULD BE FIRED  AND FRONT STAFF  SHOULD BE FIRED   NO CLASS NO RESPECT NO SERVICE,?
887958,Dinner with a party of nine   The service was excellent  The were quick and attentive  The food was fast and plates were big  We tried 7 different dishes and the family thought the peppered beef was the hit The orange beef was the second choice  Of you are looking for a family friendly place to eat  give Simis a try ,?
888667,Dirty ceiling and walls  A little pricy but the gyros are good  Id give these guys a year before theyre out of business ,?
889158,Dirty  local drunks and heavy smoking  Nice enough staff but really kind of disappointing  Not a place that tourists would like ,?
889318,Dirty  Stinky  A tiny little place with the restroom right in the lobby    Not a good thing for a restaurant   Took forever to get two sandwiches  Over 20 minutes  Wont be returning ,?
890014,Disappointed in this place  I wanted to take my wife out for dinner   But they charge $10 00 for a stupid UFC fight  Nice way to lose business ,?
890730,Disappointed! Tried to book a sitter for 5 children   got a woman on the phone telling me its basically a hassle for them to watch 5 children and she wants them to all be sleeping by the time they get there     I didnt even get to book a service because the way she spoke to me I felt she didnt even want our business based upon the fact that there would be 5 children to watch  I didnt care about the extra fee for an additional child but I dont want someone who doesnt feel up to it to watch my children  Just sad because the other reviews seem like they enjoyed the service as long as you dont exceed the limit!,?
891625,Disappointed    came in with my significant other to have a couples massage and foot awakening $290    both my masseuse and the foot awakening aesthetician had long nails    therefore  they could not do a good deep tissue massage   I asked for it to be harder and deeper  not just surface rubbing of my skin  but when the masseuse tried she just ended up scraping me with her nails   The only reason Im giving two stars is because everyone was very nice and friendly  but honestly it was a waste of time and money   Maybe because I was there on a Sunday??  We made our appointment several days in advance so Im not certain    wherever I go in the future I would be sure to ask for someone without long nails!,?
892468,Disappointing! WAY OVER PRICED for less than average sushi  They try to be too fancy with their roll by smothering them in nuts  fruits  and other things! Some of the combos are just gross! For example  my roll was suppose to have fresh tuna on it but it looked like they had mashed the tuna up and molded it like catnip on top of my roll! Then  our seared tuna was completely covered with huge chunks of cracked pepper and sesame seeds   thats all you could even taste! Nothing was impressive  For a $90 tab  I was hoping for at least average!,?
892568,Disappointing  unfortunately below the level of a high school play  A couple of fantastic singing voices ,?
894173,Disclaimer: My sister used to work here  so I have eaten my fair share of free food from this place  allowing me to taste more or less everything Flos has some of the best hot and sour soup I have ever had   It is so good  it is a bad thing because I cannot eat it anywhere else without being disappointed   Really The food is all pretty good  nothing outstanding  nothing terrible   I try and mix it up every time  so there is nothing that I prefer over anything else   Take a stab at any thing The happy hour here and at all Flos places is pretty sweet  1/2 off all appetizers  table or bar  and same with drinks   It is hard to beat The restrooms are nice private stalls  clean and stocked   4 Flushes ,?
894482,Disclosure: I am a vendor at the market Having disclosed that  though  the Mesa Farmers Market has hung in there for well over a decade and the customers who flock to it are a dedicated bunch  who are seriously interested in supporting this market and watching it grow from a few vendors to dozens   The market managers and main farmers are seriously dedicated to getting the local food producers into the view of the public ,?
896399,Disgustingly filthy  Greasy grime and dead bugs everywhere  i e  floors  windows  tables  kitchen  Has not been cleaned in years  I dont think anyone has ever even mopped the floor  Despite this food can be ok but very inconsistent ,?
896614,Dishonest and unreliable company! RUN dont Walk!Company should be investigated!Zero Stars!,?
897439,Ditto to what every one else has said; this place is definitely worth checking out (and revisiting in my case!)  In short  the food was great & reasonably priced too  My exposure to Scandenavian cuisine has been limited to Ikea  so its nice to have somewhere that offers a little bit of Sweden right down the street from my house Even better than the food was the service  The family that runs the place is adorable & eager to please  They take care to give all patrons A service  and this certainly made an impression on me No doubt about it  Ill be returning with by friends to try the desserts (as I was too stuffed from my gigantic meal to even try and tackle the sweet treats!),?
898240,Do I really think this is real       Nope!Do I think it was funny       Yep!The guy has been doing it for a long time and he has perfected his craft   The greeting staff was super polite and helpful  They even moved our seats to the front  Overall great date night atmosphere! Dont wait   its been 13 years and there might not be a lot more left in the old guy        :) j k,?
899424,Do a good job  extra service for full cleaning inside at a reasonable price    We are on a monthly plan  recently increased prices slightly but were upfront and proactive about the increase  unlike most places that try and be sneaky about it  We received a mailer and the gentleman standing by the entry wanted to make sure we were aware   ,?
899845,Do not board your big dog here!  Unless you upgrade to the suite   Otherwise your large dog is put in a very small cubicle   If it goes to the bathroom while in this plastic cage your pet will be sitting in itAlso the moment they took my yellow lab in they took her outside and a man was hosing her off  Why? I saw it because I asked for a tourI could not believe what I was seeing  She was cowering against the fence while being pressure hosedI had to upgrade to a bit of a larger kennel after I saw where they were putting her sad wet bodyLuckily I was only away one nightAsk for tour before you board your petIt seems Animal Control should inspect these places before they openAlso there is no shade in the outdoor areasI WOULD NOT recommend this kennel,?
899864,Do not book them there customer service is non existent  They wont step up to the plate and work with us on and issue that is partially there fault  Spouting contract articles is not how to handle a situation  For such large company to not admit they made and error is pretty sad  Buyer beware ,?
900458,Do not come here with a group  Their waiter takes a looong time to place and bring drink orders  The waiter then takes your order and come back after 1015 minutes to say that they dont have the item you ordered anymore  They ran out literally a minute ago  Then you order something different and are told that they also are out of THAT item   Each item was labeled as a signature dish  How do you run out of something labeled as such and not inform guests before they order  Upsetting place  Tons and tons of other restaurant options around it to consider ,?
900485,Do not come here! They wont even acknowledge you or ask you if youve been helped  I came to this location twice once on a Saturday and although it was slow and there were salesmen outside not once did one of them approach me after about 10 minutes of me walking around so I left and decided to give them a second try on a weekday and again this time a salesperson passed by me without even asking if I had been helped  I figured if theyre really looking to sell me a car they would approach me instead of it having to be the other way around  Although this place is close to my house I would rather drive further and get better customer service somewhere else ,?
902008,Do not go here! They used to have a girl that was fantastic  I was getting great results with no pain  I went for my final treatment yesterday and someone else did it  I kept jumping and telling her it hurt too much and asked her to turn it down three times  The machine was up way too high and I am burned  By the time I got home I had welts that are now scabbing over  I have never had a problem before and misuse of the equipment is inexcusable  Not worth it when you can go to place that will not cause harm! Unfortunately I just purchased another package but will not be returning ,?
902973,Do not hesitate to call Apex garage door repair  My garage door suddenly stopped working and I could not close it  Apex to the rescue! I had an appointment within two hours  Zack was at my front door  He was very thorough explaining as he went along  The garage door was repaired  he reprogrammed it and all is well! I highly recommend Apex!,?
903118,Do not leave this earth until you try one of their ginger cookies  Spicy as all out  with a molasses roll  Unique and incredibly delicious   Seriously  I was going to attach a picture; but I ate them all before I could draw get my camera out   Sorry ,?
903330,Do not live here  The apartment complex is infested with bed bugs and will cost $400$700 for extermination  which is due immediately  I thought the Burns Pest Control truck was a permanent resident   but I guess they are there on a daily basis for extermination services  The apartment manager is unethical  unreliable  and unresponsive  Save your self the hassle  there are better places out there!,?
903378,Do not miss their samples  their ham salad  their oregonzola  their 50 cent white macadamia or M&M cookies  huge floral section  their unsweetened flavored iced tea  or their flavored coconut water   AJs is a treat!  You are encouraged to sit out on the patio and chat or read ,?
903425,Do not move here this  week it beet stole three  cars for the parking and some one tried to stole my car yesterday and today my neighbor car was stolen the manager of this place socks they dont anything and police either ,?
903644,Do not order from this company  The women that emailed me back was rude and made me feel like an idiot for not know what Im talking about  I have a machine that measures in fl oz  and when I weighed the oil after I took it out of the bottle  Each one was missing  35 ounces  And didnt want to solve the issue  She insisted I was wrong and then left me with a have a nice day  As per customer service  sucks  And rude  DO NOT BUY!!!!! ANYTHING FROM THIS COMPANY!!! Dont do it  they are liars ,?
905549,Do not use this location or any other quick and clean the machine and/or equipment scratches your car thus requiring you to have it buffed to be removed  I have taken the risk of not bringing one but two of my vehicles to determine the cause and the scratches present in the same Area throughout the body of each vehicle ,?
905737,Do not walk  RUN from this hotel   Worst hotel ever   Without rambling the issues are: elevators literally move at snails pace  WiFi is unusable  food in cafe not good  no conveniences to purchase such as snacks or water unless you have correct Canadian coins  hotel key cards magically stop working and requires another back and forth with their slow elevators   Carpets need replacing in rooms  very gross with bare feet ,?
905938,Do not waste your time coming here  You are required to sign up for a card and pay for it  The line takes at least an hour and thats only the first step  Save your money and time and go to a regular driving range,?
906337,Do they need another review? No but this way my friends can just look at my reviews and know where to go  Always great  lunch or dinner  I really want to try sangria Sunday brunch  gotta find a good baby sitter  If you go get the bruschetta board  among your choices make sure to include roasted red peppers and goat cheese  I like the proscuito and fig too  Apple and brie make the cut too  The pub board is awesome too  Great place for a date if you get those anymore ,?
906420,Do you LOVE overpriced mushrooms and risotto? Do you love 19year old hosts who you wised were like 7 years older? If you like to share food  then this is the place for you I was in AZ for a bachelorette party  and two of girls in our party suggested CC for our Friday night dinner  A few of us ordered items to share: beet risotto  short rib risotto  crispy mac n cheese  mushroom pan fry   Pass on the gazpacho  and the crispy mac n cheese was waaaaaay spicy  Anyway    the setting worked for our group of 7  The menu is definitely interesting ,?
907090,Do you like food comas? Do you believe that theres a buffet on this planet where EACH AND EVERY ITEM is perfect  delicious  and has the same quality and amazement as an entree youd order off of a menu? If you believe  then youre in for a treat  India Oven is truly that place; the very first buffet Ive ever been to in which none of the food served tasted like    it was from a buffet  Everything is awesome  The service is impeccable  and they constantly throw the best garlic naan on earth at you  This is why Im fat  and Im so proud to be!,?
907467,Do you need a lesson in gluttony  well this place delivers  My burger was fantastic  burger with fries on a Monday will set you back 5 clams  You heard me right Huge order of perfectly cooked hand cut taters  juicy burger with cheese and bacon on a nice bun Well done Senor Local,?
908093,Do yourself a favor and avoid this location and company at all cost  With over 70 people in line they literally have 3 employees working the counter  Customers with reservations are mixed in with customers that have no reservations and spend 15 to 20 minutes discussing options with the counter staff  There are dozens of people waiting outside completely lost of where to go due to lack of staff  This is my first experience with Fox Rental Cars and will be definitely my last  Regardless of the savings you may think you are getting its not worth putting up with the lack of professionalism and customer care ,?
908419,Do yourself a favor and look no further  this is one of the best dog grooming experiences Ive ever had my life  The customer service from the owner and her staff were excellent and they did exactly as I instructed for the cut of my sons hair Bonsai ,?
908852,Do  Not  If you plan on staying up until 4am every night  the hotel is fine  If you want to go tget bed before 4am  DO NOT stay here  Music is blaring until 4  This is horrible! The ear plugs are a joke and who can sleep with those in anyway  Im not trying to be a party pooper  but the last time I stayed a few years ago  I dont recall this  My husband could care less  At 321am hes asleep  while I write this review unable to sleep  The rooms are pretty nice overall  but not worth it to me  The deal isnt even worth it  Lesson learned :(,?
908963,Doc was caring and actually concerned  took the time to discuss my medical history  The office was clean  quiet  and effecient  I was in and out for my annual physical in less than 30 minutes Note: give yourself an extra few minutes before your appointment to locate the office within the building  it is kind of a maze ,?
909358,Doctors Nassar (he loves his music!)  Avraham  Lu (Muito Obrigado for always taking time to say hello to my wife!) & Petersen as well as their outstanding staff (Brenda & Kelsey and your other great team members whose names I unfortunately cant recall) have been fantastic to work with during the diagnostic and treatment phases Ive had the good fortune of having positive experiences on each of my multiple visits ( Ill be using this practice on an ongoing basis ) over the past year   The people of this office have been attentive to my issues and have worked painstakingly with me during my treatment and have done so with positive attitudes   Forever appreciative to my friends @ Arizona Pain Treatment Center in Mesa for working so hard to help me have a better quality of life!PS  Keep on rockin Dr  Nassar!!Hook Em!,?
909465,Does 4 stars seem high for an auto store? I gave this auto zone that bcuz they had a good selection of steering covers and car smelly goods which is what I came for great customer service too plus I guess I needed some antifreeze which was on sale  Ill be back!,?
910521,Doesnt have the LA korean style bbq but they do have the table top grill! The seasoning on the steaks are amazing and the staff is extremely on point and warm welcoming   I totally recommend this place and their food  Dont set ur standards too high and expect it to be like NY or LA ,?
911774,Dominos calls itself a technology company   My experience with them suggests they are rude and either deceitful about their technology or just inept   Maybe both   I ordered a pizza last night at 9:30  delivery was est 3040min   My fancy app said my pizza came out of oven at 9:51   At 10:10 I called and was told we are running a little behind  Recognizing my app said the pizza was completed at 9:51   Im thinking ok cold pizza   At 10:25  when my pizza still hadnt been delivered  I asked Aaron the  manager what the deal was   He suggested he was under a lot of stress and running behind (note to Aaron  if making pizzas is stressful  you have far larger problems for which Im sorry)  Aaron assured me the pizza would be there by 10:4010:45 at latest   At 11:00  no pizza I cancelled my order   Nice job Dominos   You suck,?
911895,Don Molumby was a pleasure to work with and he took excellent care of my 2015 Range Rover Sport   I love my blackedout wheels  and Im happy that I went with Dons recommendation to make them semigloss instead of flat black   Don also went above and beyond to replace three of my tinted windows since there were small bubbles in all   I had only checked the drivers side front and wouldnt have known about the other two until later   A big thanks to Don!,?
912772,Dont be fooled by appearances   Give Eureka a visit and youll probably find a reason to go back   The video poker payoffs arent total ripoffs and the bar is fantastic with 13 or 14 beers on tap  The staff goes out of their way to be friendly and Fat choy is in a cullinary category of its own for Vegas ( outside of Chinatown)   One way to come out ahead is to get a pitcher of beer at the bar for only $8 and then take it into fat choy for lunch or dinner  Pitchers arent sold to bar patrons  just to restaurant customers ,?
913010,Dont be fooled by the name The waiters rush their diners to leave and expect tip asap,?
913166,Dont be fooled by their advertisements for serving deals  Most recently  their advertised service deal didnt include anything but paying someone to look at the AC unit   no cleaning  We were quoted 700 bucks for 5 lbs of coolant for a leak  extra for some sealer that may or may not solve the problem  I called an independent  licensed  and insured contractor who serviced the unit included cleaning (even cleared a clog on the drip pipe  no charge)  He also charged the coolant (only 1 lb was needed) and found and fixed 1 leak ( a common spot for leaks)  Total cost was much less than Georges quote ,?
913389,Dont be put off by the decor in this place their food is legit! I personally have had their cheese steak  hot Italian  and fries  Their bread is good  their meat is delicious  and their fries are FRESH not frozen  Theyre made to order  and perfection  Two people can easily share a small fry the portions are generous  If youve got a hankering for a legitimate hoagie/sub  head to Peppis  You wont be disappointed ,?
913664,Dont believe the hype from the leasing agent! Management is unresponsive  laundry machines dont work  the lock on our back door was broken when we moved in and hasnt been fixed as of three weeks later  There have just been way too many problems for us only having lived here for less than a month  and nobody from Shaker Square Apartments has been willing to help ,?
913896,Dont bother !  Our waitress proclaimed the new chef was a problem  and this was confirmed by the poor presentation and quality of our food   We ordered the Bombay Platter which sounded delicious but amounted to a small platter of over cooked meats on a bed of cheap chopped iceberg lettuce   We ordered Paneer Tikka Masala but what was served tasted like burnt tofu sitting stop a bed of chopped iceberg lettuce   No taste whatsoever here so dont waste your money or time   India Palace remains my favorite Indian restaurant in Vegas ,?
914842,Dont but anything from the display counter  Bought some snacks such as mutton rolls and fish buns  They were definitely old and most likely left over stuff from previous day  Only the made to order products are OK to buy  Learned my lesson today ,?
915213,Dont come here after 12am  Dont come here after 1am  unless you want to wait in line for 20 minutes  Wait  just dont come here  or dont come underdressed during the winter unless youre on the guest list and best friends with the partythrowers  When you get inside youll have to shed all 10 layers of winter clothing and hold onto it  This is more of a young professional/young drinker venue with a dressy upscale dive vibe  Musics too loud to talk  so just be prepared to dance or throw drinks back and hobble home as soon as you can The music wasnt terribleit was a trap act that night but I was jammed behind the DJ booth and a ton of people were standing on the velvet couches  dancing  I felt old  It was humid  Armpits  elbows  armpits everywhere! Someone handed me a drink that was probably three quarters vodka  I was worried about being roofied so I pretended to drink it  Hmm  why am I complaining so much since I got in for free?,?
915476,Dont come here if youre in a time crunch  And $25 for a mediocreatbest sandwich and coke? I dont care if it is sit down  No thanks  Skip this place ,?
915775,Dont come here  Sad to say  They left me waiting 15 minutes to take a drink order all while helping the table ne let to me that was seated after me HORRIBLE SERVICE RUINED THE WHOLE NIGHT!!!!,?
916273,Dont do it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  They are trying so hard to sell you a timeshare that they forget about taking care of the basics when you stay there    The place is dirty and they dont even have maid service for your stay   They dont even clean the common areas you have to walk through  those are dirty too  I would not recommend this  it isnt even near the strip  it is 6 miles away The onsite staff is so incompetent  they cant even find a bandaid for an injury suffered while on their property Try making a reservation  forget it!  It was the most frustrating process  after making my reservation  I called to confirm and no reservation was on record   Even after talking to 3 different people on 3 seperate occasions  still no reservation I have a timeshare in Cancun and I get maid service daily there ,?
916774,Dont even bother going anywhere else  The guy greeted us and was very friendly  The lady at the desk was lovely  The lobby has comfy couches  tv  drinks and snacks for free  The prices were great  You get a punch card and the 6th trip is free  This was our first time and we were blown away ,?
916866,Dont even bother yourself this make any bids  you see this stock photos and then the actual photos and read the description where stared NEW  you pick up the staff and after you open it when you home you discovered that its missing staff  item is damaged or sometime not even in a working condition! ALSO their staff at pick up changes every week you can stand there for an hour!! I used be heavy buyer with them but thats it closed my account after figured out that its not worth it,?
918291,Dont get in line immediately if youre indecisive; the staff here keep things moving at a good clip and youll need to reassure them multiple times that youre still undecided  This is the place to go when you want food fast  but not fast food  That said  they dont publish their nutritional information anywhere  so its probably less healthy than Id like it to be  Servings are not huge  but I suspect they dump oil on nearly all of their salads  you wont go hungry anytime soon if you get the combo with a sandwich  Everything Ive ordered here tastes pretty good ,?
918317,Dont get it  Usually this place has great food & service; I was surprised today  While placing our order lady manager comes over and interrupts cashier  asking her to change soup sign  when a line of customer waits to place order  WTH!! Finally sit down and guy sitting next to us is so pissed off   because his pancake order has gone missing  They finally get his order  but customer is still obviously upset   Then as we sit having breakfast they are scrambling to find another order  I dont know what happened here but they better get there act together ,?
918353,Dont get me wrong  the food is Great  but even when you call in your order and given a time they are still slow    Im hoping as they work through the staff and get a few months under their belts the times will improve   ,?
918969,Dont get the food   Its a rip off! I went to the outside window because I didnt feel like waiting for the restaurant  We got sliders   they were whatever   overpriced I only wanted to go to try the famous hot chocolate  It was good  Nothing amazing  honestly  I really think Dunkins is comparable  Had to do it to say I did it!,?
919356,Dont go here ! They are all over the news because they accused a woman of stealing   called the cops on her and told the police that she was being violent and possibly had a weapon on her when she was recording the ENTIRE time   Thats totally unprofessional   Source: http://www fox5vegas com/story/37080660/valleybeautysupplysecurityguardcalledpoliceoncustomerfilminginteraction,?
919534,Dont go here if you have a short connection  It took 30 mins to get my food even though the Restruant was not packed  The portions are small consider the price  Management seemed to care less if I was a happy customer ,?
919960,Dont go here   It took over an hour   VeryVeryVery POOR service   After waiting over an hour for a hamburger and fries  I got up and left   On the way out I went out of my way to tell my server that I was leaving because I was hungry   She said I had to pay for the hamburger and fries that NEVER arrived!  VeryVeryVery POOR customer service   Not going back there ,?
920974,Dont got to this casino unless you want to receive bodily injury from security  The casino security gave me second degree burns all over my body by sitting on top of me on the black asphalt  Then refused to get me to a hospital  I had to scream for help from the police,?
923237,Dont let the outside appearance shy you away  My husband and I always make this part of our todo list anytime going to or passing through Vegas  BEST pizza and wings around  We usually order the Guinea Pie Pizza and hot wings (no fries) Our recent trip the pizza was in its own area (not sharing with the bar) which was nice since we didnt have to eat while breathing in all the smoke  This place is two   thumbs up!,?
923302,Dont let the outside of the building or the surrounding ghost town of a strip mall fool you   go through the door and find possibly the best Thai in Vegas  Ok so I generally keep things very simple when trying new Thai places and these guys blew away my expectations  A buddy told me about this place a year ago and unfortunately we didnt get a chance to try it so last week I made it a point to stop in  and so glad I did  In keeping it simple I went for spicy vegetable soup and Pad Thai  Both of these dishes were fantastic  with a big peppery bite in the Thai hot Spicy Vegetable Soup  and the Pad Thai was so flavorful  best Ive had in Vegas hands down  The place looks like a dive but swing in its well worth it  lunch on weekdays things were quite so that might be your chance to beat the dinner rush that others have mentioned   worked out perfect for me ,?
923775,Dont like rookie packers   They forgot items and I didnt bother checking because I normally didnt need to   Check your bags people  staffers arent doing what they should   May consider elsewhere in the future if I have to watch who is packing my bags ,?
923914,Dont listen to the news about the crime in Homewood  dont let that deter you from coming to this spot where they have awesome drink specials the killer Chef Andre and the Galactic kitchen who gets down on a different level!!  Anything from wings to lobster tail!! (Please try the Garlic Chicken tenders though!) And they have beautiful barmaids (shout out to Crystal)  along with a cool bar owner (shout out to Big D & Lil D) FLAT OUT DONT MISS IT!,?
924106,Dont mean to be snobby  but soaked in grease shrimpall preparations are not my idea of healthy eating choices    cheddar biscuits are a round heart attack to come  how about fewer greasy items  perhaps simply grilled  with a salad of fresh not stale green leaf lettuce   Lots of overweight diners who obviously like the fare ,?
925023,Dont purchase a gift card from this Souper Salad!  If they mess up and dont activate the card  they wont honor it  even if you have a receipt to prove the purchase!,?
925298,Dont rent a car from here  just walk  Customer service is honestly disgusting and the women who works there is far from professional  Terribleterribleterrible ,?
925437,Dont see what all the hype is with Dunkin Donuts coffee,?
925442,Dont see what the big fuss is about Wilbur  my second time here  had the burrito the first time (per my husbands recommendation)  I would had given that a 3star as well  My friend really liked Wilbur and so we met here again and this time I got the Shrimp Fajitas  there was no pepper next to any menu items to indicate that it was spicy  I doubt Im the only one who wish they would include that  Their pineapple salsa from the bar is my favourite  Their line moves pretty quickly for ordering  Its waiting for the food that could take about 15 minutes in the heart of lunch rush ,?
925654,Dont sleep on the diner!  I wasnt feeling that great but still wanted a traditional meal  so I ended up here on Thanksgiving day   I guess everyone had the same idea or just wanted breakfast before their evening meal?! I dont know but the line was out the door and on the sidewalk   I just wanted takeout and ordered the Thanksgiving special  turkey  stuffing  greens  mac n cheese   It took just as long for takeout as it did to dine in  but other than that the food was really good  just what I wanted despite the long wait   Although it was crazy busy  the staff handled it like champs with a smile and great attitudes ,?
925986,Dont take your car here  The dealership recommended AW but I would never recommend to anyone  They took longer then they said to fix my door and when I finally got the car back it wouldnt open from the inside! I took it back to be fixed then a rattle and air leak started in the door  I again took it back and it still didnt get fixed  The dealership took a look at the door and agreed it was not done correctly  I took it back a third time b/c they said they had fired those working their previously and the current team would do it right  Again they didnt fix the problem  The only reason I give them one star is b/c of the friendly and professional lady at the front desk  They must have some kind of deal with the dealerships to keep getting their business ,?
926343,Dont trust this dealer   They dont stand behind their product even on a newly purchased vehicle ,?
926568,Dont understand the myriad of bad reviews  We get hot wings here every week  and theyre great If you have to wait extra time for your order they give you extra wings or offer you a free soda while you wait Ive been eating KFC since 1968 when they first opened on the square in Madison Always loved it  always will  The only thing better is Browns Chicken  but alas none around here ,?
927232,Dont waste youre time coming here    unless you want wrong orders and cold cheeseburgers and bad customer service  ,?
927437,Dont waste your money or time! Excessively long delivery time after 8:00 p m  And when quoted 40 minutes  Poor delivery service  Lied about being in area only to show up 30 minutes later  Delivery driver called multiple times by store on where he was and delivery status and he never answered phone  Too many other quality timely pizza options in Scottsdale area ,?
927636,Dont waste your money  Only beer available is San Tan (really not a beer festival) and the BBQ is meh ,?
927751,Dont waste your time and money coming to this place  Its 8am and Im sitting at the bar with the bartender having a pissy attitude b/c Im just having water  Its the only location where I saw a plugin for my device  The food on the other hand is very greasy     Omelet and potatoes and a pound of grease  Keep calm and keep walking by the joint!,?
928036,Dont waste your time here  Theyre rude and the food isnt that good  Got two things  The steak tacos and the salad  I would rather have had just steak but they dont give just steak alone  So  I ordered the steak tacos and the steak salad  I didnt want the French fries that came with it  so i I asked to have one extra taco  I even said I would pay however much extra that would cost  6  10$ whatever it cost  The girl said NO!!! Are you serious? I offered to pay however much extra it cost  But apparently they cant do that  Thats ridiculous    this place is not worth it,?
928109,Dont waste your time or $$$ at either location  there is not one single thing about either location that is good  Service was horrific and the food was even worse !,?
928351,Dont waste your time or your money worst car wash Ive ever been to!! After going back and showing the manager and him working on it  I still had to come home and finish cleaning it!,?
928573,Dont waste your time!!! I dropped my wife off here for a quick fill  I returned an hour later and she was still waiting to be serviced! The most ridiculous thing was that she had made an appointment! I would have snagged her and left but they had already strategically soaked her nails in acetone so we had to stay to fix this mess  Never again!,?
928683,Dont waste your time   This was comp so I didnt spend any money    The service? The lady that rang us up was too busy talking to someone else and only half was hearing what were were saying  When we walked in no one was there and I had to ask if we could sit anywhere oh no! This lady said  Forget about our waitress who did not smile but asked us  what you want to drink? Im not kidding here  The food   It was a lunch and still breakfast being served buffet  I thought the Chinese food looked good  I grabbed some noodles  asian chicken salad  pot stickers  It was bad! After a few bites I gave up and had a salad ( did someone really need to toss it for me?) I also had some crackers  cheese and champagne  That was my dinner  The dessert was good but hardly enough for a meal conclusion  Save your money people  I will not be back! I even have one more comp to use for this Buffett and I will not be using it!,?
928820,Dont waste your time  The food is bland  cold and overpriced  If you even consider it  just know that you might be late for your flight  This is not the place to end your Vegas trip  I stopped by the grill while flying through on a work trip  The table was dirty after being quickly wiped up by a busser  It took 15 minutes to get my order taken and the burger I got was cold and over cooked   Tasted like it had been sitting under a heat lamp with a bunch of other sad burgers waiting for the next sucker to order  By the time I had placed my order I had to pay and hope that my food would come out in time for me to make my next flight  Your money is better spent elsewhere ,?
928891,Dont waste your time   Its been one headache after another dealing with this practice They dont answer calls!The dont return messages!They reschedule appts as they wish!Advise varies from daytoday!I should have read the reviews her first!,?

930052,Dont get me wrong  I am addicted to Zoyo  but something is going on here  Owners should maybe start coming in at night  The past few months they continue to be tearing down way too early  staple flavors not avliable  and tonight they had 4 machines turned off  I am all for hiring these young kids to work  I think it great  However  they all have really become rude and lack basic customer service skills  Train them up to be the best darn froyo employess in Gilbert  Also  what is up with putting tasting cups at the front counter? I highly doubt people in Gilbert are coming in for free samples and leaving  I will admit  I have come in and sampled and left over the past few months because soamy machines are down ,?
930256,Dont let the Dumb name fool you  this is a good sushi place with no New Zealand food or flair  It is a small little place with some good fresh sushi! This is the first place in Charlotte that I have actually really liked their food  as far as sushi goes that is  When you do go there  know that you will be sitting very close to other patrons and will be able to hear what everyone is talking about in the restaurant  The staff is very friendly and accommodating towards odd orders which is nice  The Spicy Mayo is very Mayoie or however you spell that word  Go there on your Birthday and you will get a free meal  21 and over and make sure you bring your ID  I recommend this place as long as your in the area  I will be going back!,?
930535,Dont watch this show   Waste of money and time   I would rather be covered by honey and have ants cover my body than to sit through another minute of that show   It was the worst Cirque show EVER and i have seen every single Cirque show in vegas   If u really want to see a Cirque show I highly recommend LOVE ,?

932154,Doug is our post man and he is AMAZING! He goes above and beyond customer service standards Frank  on the other hand  is one of the most unhelpful people Ive ever encountered  I also work for a government agency and this guy is the reason people believe government employees are lazy  Along with his inability to get off of his chair  he puts in 0% effort to be friendly  polite or pleasant  This post office is lucky to have Doug to counter the negativity and misery that pours from Frank ,?
932484,Down the stairs to to a subterranean bar and restaurant  A cozy underworld  lit by candle light and fireplace  With no windows  time stands still  Bartender Perry served up the drinks  and some great happy hour dishes during this journey through the change in the continuum of spacetime  Walking up the stairs I noticed it was dark  What happened to the sun? What happened to the last three hours? Maybe we were abducted  Maybe Perry is an alien?!To Trisha S     There are no highchairs because this is an adult restaurant  not a Chuck E  Cheese  Get a baby sitter  and stop ruining everyones dinner  And I know that youre going to say But my child is STOP! Your kid is an annoying  dinner disrupting troll  just like everybody elses ,?
932584,Downgrading 1 star for Bread selection  In as store that carries biodegradable sandwich and trash bags you would think that SOMEONE would provide REAL hot dog buns to go with the organic  no nitrate hot dogs????? There are still many great things about this store  but now that we have moved to Ohio and tried to shop all of the sections the bread selection was too painful to leave this at 5 stars  EVERY roll    without exception    had HFC or some version of MSG (Modified Food Starch is my favorite hiding phrase)    an employee even gave us several other bread bakeries to try when questioned  Cheese  awesome Cleaners  lots of environmentally happy choices Grab and go fondue dip made in store  covered Bread  HORRIBLE!!!,?

945173,Dr  Mallary Forrest of Solace Dentistry saved me from what could have been extremely painful and unnecessary dental work  I first came to Dr  Forrest with a cracked molar  My previous dentist insisted the root was dead and offered to perform a root canal  without anesthetic  and have me on my way in 20 minutes  I am so thankful I sought out a second opinion  Dr  Forrest conducted several tests and sure enough  the molar root was alive  I shudder to think of the pain I would have endured trying to attempt a root canal without an anesthetic!Dr  Forrest referred me to an Endodontist to make the determination  I so appreciate all of her careful considerations  I now have a highly durable  zirconia cap on a live tooth!  More recently  she expertly repaired poor bonding work that was jagged and sloppy  while replacing an old filling and filling a new cavity  I have sent many referrals to Solace!

945890,Dr  Mitchell Song is wonderful! We had taken our dog to another specialist in Gilbert for removal of a hemangioma from his eye and they wanted over $2 000 to do this procedure  it was ridiculous   Anyway  another vet recommended Dr  Song and he did the procedure for about $600    thats quite a difference   The procedure went great  and Dr  Song personally called us to tell us the procedure was done and our dog doing fine   He then again  personally  called us later in the evening to check on our dog   Dr  Song is personable & professional; his office is immaculate and his staff is very friendly  I highly recommend ,?

947077,Dr  Philipp and his staff are exceptional!! Thankfully I found him after a pretty rough experience with another dentist  and I sought a second opinion with Dr  Philipp  I was very anxious and scared to visit  but he was incredibly kind and compassionate  and patiently listened to my concerns and fears  I am so grateful I found him  he found issues the other dentist missed and would have caused me more pain and $$ later on  Unfortunately for me it meant having the same procedure done twice  but the difference between the two was like night and day  His tools are advanced and he was incredibly thorough yet gentle  and I had no pain in my jaw like before  From the massage button on the dental chairs  to offering me chapstick when I commented my lips felt dry  they truly made me feel comfortable and cared for  Oh  and they charged much less than my previous dentist  I dont think it gets any better!!,?
948147,Dr  Sara Penton told me she could cure my allergies   After months and months(not to mention ALOT of money)   she said its probably my thyroid    Dr  Sara Penton is a complete SCAM as is her allergy cure    do NOT get swindled like I did!!!

953741,Drive thru line was crazy long for a Thursday night at almost 10 oclock  So that maybe the reason my order was wrong  They were also out of the cotton candy blizzard  which was disappointing for my boyfriend  And to add to it all they discontinued the mint flavor!!!

955545,Dropped in after a long walk on the strip and boy was I glad that I did  The frozen drinks here are very good and only cost $10  Which is a steal for a place on the strip  They also participate in the cityzens app program where you can get 5 free drinks everyday for downloading that app  The bartender Rachel told me about this awesome program and I was able to share it with a few people in our group who were able to take advantage of the deal also  We ended up dropping by a few times as we were staying at the LINQ hotel and this is connected directly to the link by walking through the casino  I didnt order any food  we just would order drinks which were always delicious  My favorite was the frozen blueberry lemonade margarita ,?
956072,Dropped in on a Saturday workout and they had dodgeball and tag   Was very disappointed and hoping the programming was more than what we herd  Had to make up our own workouts to get a sweat   Buyer beware  he should have never charged guests with such weak workouts ,?

Keep up the great beer guys!!,?
960742,Dumplings are juicy and I enjoyed both steamed and fried dumplings  We also ordered stirfried snow pea leaves with garlic and deep fried chicken with hot pepper flakes  Snow pea leaves were a bit overcooked  thus too stringy and fibrous  Chickens were nicely cooked  Everything is cheap here without sacrificing the quality of food  Portion sizes are generous too  The place is quite big but I have never seen it being fully packed  Overall  a good place to grab a quick bite ,?
961044,Dunwellz is fine dining meets a pub/bar/grill atmosphere if you ask me  Food is good if not great  especially the Notorious P I G  burger  Ive only been there two times and Ive ordered that sandwich both times and its very good  Money is fair on the pocket in terms of price  You get can 2 good beers  a meal and a appetizer for around about $25 not too bad  I enjoy the atmosphere  its nice to get out  And the people are friendly too  Just make sure you have plenty of napkins for this burger/sandwich!,?
961402,During a recent stay at the Golden Nugget wanted to watch the game while eating  so decided on the Cadillac Mexican Kitchen since they have lots of nice tvs and comfy couch seats  I thought the service was great  from the hostess greeting me as I entered to the attentive bartender that checked in regularly to see if I needed anything else!  As for the food I thought it was alright but just did not match the excellent service   The real disappointment was with the margaritas I had   I ordered the house margarita on the rocks with salt but found them to be too sweet with not enough tequila!   So based on the great service and relaxed seating would return if I am just after appetizers and to catch a game  but if out for dinner will probably head to one of the many other excellent Mexican restaurants in the area ,?
961857,During my last Vegas trip Cashman @ Cirque took our group pictures They were quite cute  though we either would have preferred more direction or less direction as per the pictures  especially considering the two we received were almost exactly the same facially We werent offered any online pics (that would have been awesome) but ended up purchasing the two in the book for $45  which considering we paid almost $200 per ticket  split between two of us  wasnt that bad A nice memory of the visit  but much more frou frou than it needed to be  We could have done without the book and would have been willing to download the online pictures for a small fee  Id love to see them switch over to an easier system ,?
961976,During my recent trip in Montreal I wanted to check out different bars in the city  This is a cool concept for a bar! This bar has great drinks and fun old school games to play  It is a cool spot for a chill night  especially for a bunch of 80s and 90s babies   They had a few arcade games  NES  Sega  Xbox  Nintendo 64  and board games  I ended up playing Super Mario and Street Fighter for the night  They have a wide selection of drinks for a decent price  $6$7 a drink with entertainment and a walk down to memory lane is priceless! I tried an IPA and a mixed drink  The mixed drink I had was called Wonder Woman  It was delicious and couldnt taste the alcohol but it definitely hit me! I would recommend this bar if you are ever looking to have an interactive and fun night with your friends,?
962708,During the last 23 years I have been here several times w family  friends  and colleagues  We are never disappointed  The service is on the slow side  but its not a fast food joint! The staff are all friendly  knowledgable  attentive  and very welcoming  The food is always fresh & delicious  I have tried a variety of: appetizers  soups  main dishes  and desserts  all very yummy  The portions are smaller  but American portions are actually huge  These portions seem to be just right  We always leave satisfied  not full  and never w doggie bags  I will happily continue to eat here and recommend it to others ,?
964089,EDIT  Sept 10  2016I was back here in June and once again walked out with records you rarely see and for extremely reasonable prices  I only bought jazz  but the psych and prog also had tons of rarities  Great shop Original:The collection here is one of the most interesting I have ever seen at a shop  Tons of rare psych  prog  and rock  Also loads of jazz  including the four absolute grails that I bought recently  Specifically  they had first pressings of Eric Dolphy Out to Lunch!  Kenny Dorham Trompetta Toccata  Wayne Shorter Night Dreamer and Larry Young Into SomethinThose records are NEVER found in the wild  but they had all four   Awesome In response to those who find the prices too high  this place is more like a record show  in that you should bring a few to the guy and make an offer  I agree that some sticker prices were a bit steep  but I haggled and ended up paying much less ,?
965289,EXCELLENT FOOD! And  the sweet old woman made for the best service  Definitely coming back! And  they have binh xeo!,?
966432,Each time I went to this place   it was perfect ! The patio is small but nice  When there is a wait  its always really fast  Employees are very nice and here to help you if you need  My favorites are the Asian Chicken Salad with an Orangina!  Perfect combo  And the price are very affordable  Love it!,?
967032,Earlier this year  Jose and his crew painted our house  replaced our patio sliding glass door  put tile in several rooms including a bathroom that the original builder had carpeted  and removed a bad tile job (from the previous owner) on our patio Jose and his crew did a GREAT job at all of it and gave us a great price (quality paint and materials by the way)!  I cannot say enough good things about Jose and his hard working crew!Super customer service and detail oriented!  Jose wants you to be 100% happy with the work!We hope to hire them again to do more work in the future for us including painting the interior of our house   *Highly Recommended*  **FIVE STARS**,?
967568,Easily Montreals finest  Its in the citys Jewish area  therefore you cant go wrong with this one ,?
968139,Easily one of the best DONUTS Ive ever consumed    Plus its a reasonable size  didnt regret it or feel gross afterwards   Flat white was good  not great  Used soy milk  tasted bad   I understand now they dont have dairy  explains that! I guess I just find soy gross  Maybe you will love soy!,?
968677,Easily the best Thai place in Madison  Typically a long wait but so worth it  Amazing  authentic food and cheery workers! Ive had most of the curry dishes they offer and loved them all  Prices are definitely affordable at about $11 for a huge meal  Favorite place to eat in all of Madison ,?
968878,Easily the best for Gobi Manchurian and Mushroom Manchurian    Little bit on the spicy side   so what drink a glass of milk once you reach home ;)Everything else also tastes good    If you are looking IndoChinese food then this will be your best bet ,?
968901,Easily the best haircut Ive ever had in my life  Ive been visiting shops ALL OVER Montreal  I was in the shop for about 10 seconds and already felt like family No one was available to take me right away  so I was asked to sit at the bar and have a scotch (Free scotch  FREE SCOTCH)  The service was top notch  The people were extremely personable We literally ended up playing cards against humanity together  keep in mind I met these people 10 minutes prior By the time I left I truly felt like family  and Adriano  Chris make sure I knew it The lad who cut my hair stayed LATE  outside of regular working hours on a Friday night  to give me a cut  Dude uses hairclippers like a paint brush  Solid I cant see why I would ever go anywhere else Already booked my appointment for next week I actually kind of want to go back every day just to say hi to everyone ,?
969029,Easily the best pizza on the west side of town    Possibly the Valley in general  If you live on the fringe of civilization like I do  as far as quality pizza goes  Garden really cant be beat  I feel kinda boring in the sense that I generally only get the margherita every time I order  but     Its really that good  According to my mother  their cheesesteaks are pretty top notch as well  but who goes to a pizzeria for cheesesteaks?At any rate  the pizzas are huge  delicious  and always ready to be picked up in just under 20 minutes on a weekday  If you want a quality pie on the far west side that wont cut your mouth up like some of the more questionable chainbased offerings everywhere else  Garden Pizza is definitely where its at ,?
970079,Easy check in and checkout  fast shuttle pick up and return  Definately will recommend to My friends  Will always use if flying out if Cleveland again!,?
970114,Easy dealership to work with from the time I called to make my appointment to take care of the standard recalls  Chris in service was very friendly and professional taking care of our needs when I came in They gave me a fair price on a few cosmetic things I asked him to take care of   They replaced a fuse to get my cig lighter working again and washed the truck for free  While waiting we did the typical walk of their sales floor  Justin and a new hire trainee answered all our questions without being pushy  Would be comfortable coming here to purchase another new Mitsubishi and will definitely be bringing my truck in for services ,?
970387,Easy peasy!! Immediate pickup at lot and airport  Driver very courteous  Rates under cover reasonable!,?
970394,Easy peezy lemon squeezey (smog check)  Right by my office and friendly staff  And supporting local business!,?
970589,Easy to deal with  Out the door price quoted it up front and honored  Even with the power going out they figured out how to make the transaction work in one visit in a short amount of time  Great price as well!Thank you Motocity!,?
970871,Easy to miss but great little spot  Huge variety in daily specials so really hard to get bored of,?
970894,Easy to navigate airport  good walkways and a nice selection of food  Always enjoy sitting on the rocking chairs in the main hub and doing some people watching  Salsa has a great burrito if you like them ,?
971016,Easy to set up an appointment  text message confirmation  mobile service to the house for install   If you want honest independent service  I suggest you use John   Great experience and Ill do business  with him and/or his company again ,?
971234,Eat Here Regularly  its a must for any foodies out there Try the Southwest Potato Pancakes & my All Time Favorite chili relleno casserole is awesome    and on very rare occasion they have A coffee cake French toast totally Mind Blowing Delicious (Please bring this back) Friendly Staff Love this place and you will too :),?
971702,Eat here  My advice is to get the large pizza and wings special because those are the two things that this place does best  Dont get to adventureus with the menu and you will leave happy and full ,?
971766,Eat lunch here every day  can not beat the lunch specials  I always eat in the isolated back bar so I can be served by the best bartender in town CLAY!!! Hes basically my hero  Tim is the homie too!!Great specials and great corporate staff that makes my visit consistent every time ,?
971864,Eat upstairs  much quieter than the hectic atmosphere of everyone ordering downstairs Ive been three times  the quality of the burger is sometimes a gamble  and my burger has been messed up on two occasions  Fries are always excellent  however ,?
973899,Eddie  is a great guy to take in our dog last minutes for a bath!   Great customer service and didnt feel rush!  I would highly recommend this location   We will be back for sure for our next grooming!,?
974500,Edited  Everything below still stands  except loss of star for their used board games  We have purchased several over the years  but recently received a game with nothing but cardboard in it and rocks  What?! I hope they check these more thoroughly in the future  but we will not be buying any used board games from them anymore  Such an awesome store! Lots to look at  something for everyone  video games  instruments  board games  and of course lots and lots of books! They offer cash or store credit for books  Friendly  quick service  Clean store that is well organized! Would highly recommended!,?
975586,Egg puff tasted great! I had the combination with matcha ice cream  black sesame ice cream  mini Oreo  marshmallows and red beans  Cashier was cute thats probably why so many girls wait in line haha ;) Price was pretty cheap too  My boyfriend had the Chinese crepe also very tasty  One place you wanna try out in Chinatown!,?
975989,Eggs works is pretty cute with the newsprint menus and cute mugs We tried it out not wanting to have motel breakfast or some fast food joint and it was ok The portions were huge (seems to be a theme at most American restaurants) so if you want a huge breakfast  definitely go here Service is great ,?
976131,Eghhhh  we went for brunch with some friends  It was decent but nothing to write home about  Maybe we need to venture out again for lunch or dinner  We ordered bloody Marys and it is neat that they infuse their vodka with a few flavors to enhance the Bloody Mary  We ordered two omelettes both had the wrong cheese  We also had the eggs Benedict  it was just okay  I mean for the price I was expecting a little more WOW! Well give it a whirl for dinner and maybe theyll win two more stars from me ,?
976335,Eh the food wasnt great but the wine is good  I like this place for a glass of vino and conversation  maybe on the patio  but not for dinner ,?
976944,Eh  what can I say  Everyone I go to culinary school just ranted and raved about this place  so I had to check it out  I got the 5 course meal with the wine pairing and fois gras upgrade and honestly  I have had all of the same dishes at at better price point with more generous portion sizes for a LOT less at other restaurants  The fois gras was amazing  especially the sorbet  But the rest was somewhat lackluster  Also my wines were almost exclusively white domestics when i made it pretty clear I preferred reds  My friends butterscotch pudding tasted like Cloroseptic      very bizarre  For 105 dollars I want to be wowed and I just wasnt  I left wondering what did I just pay for  I cant say I will be returning ,?
976976,Eh the lay out is horrible! I hate going places and the second I get there is to watch a movie  Then youre shuffled out and into the atrium  The atrium is pretty much the whole part of the experience  After the atrium is the cafe you have to cross into and then the small room of aquatic animals  I dont like how there is no reason to bring a stroller cuz there is no stroller room in the theater and u cant bring in the atrium basically no need to bring a stroller  $7 for a sandwich the cafe is overpriced  The only had one stingray to pet   The other zoos have lots!! I have to work my way through this maze back to the lobby and cross over the green screen of people taking pictures to use the restroom!,?
977421,Eh  Long wait for some pasta that was a step up from Noodles and Company  Not bad just lacking severely in flavor  I had a side grain salad that was interesting but also disappointing ,?
977681,Eh   this is the restaurant in the Cosmopolitan and this is terrible!The price is ridiculous for what is pretty much BELOW Dennys quality ina pretentious atmosphere You get martini glass on your table with fine silverware and a nice decor restaurant   The food is awfully bland I ordered the omelette so its exactly egg wrapped with small portions of food   No flavor   Add your own salt and pepper and ketchup   Oh  BTW  OJ is $6   AND  the best of all  Henry screwed up my friends burger   It looks wonderful  but again  bland and flavorless   I wouldnt go   Go to Hash House A GO GO at imperial palace!,?
977984,Ehh Ill be nice with a 3 the waitress took off too fast every time no refills she didnt want to be here obviously  But I get it  The steak wasnt that great either Im still thirsty as we speak ,?
979079,Einsteins really defines mediocrity  At best  its just ok  on average  you will probably regret your trip For starters  this location is not set up very efficiently  For some reason  you walk in  then have to hang a hard right navigate around people sitting down then arrive at the counter  Jumping forward  the bagels are really  really boring  Theyre not terrible  they wont make you sick  but theyre just so uninspired  Scottsdale has a handful of good  locally owned bagel stores where you can get a better bagel  at a much better price  After eating a bagel from there  I always kinda shake my head and ask myself why I dont just drive north a bit to a better bagel? Damn my laziness  I have a feeling that the same people that love Einsteins are the same people who think Applebees is amazing  and Walmart is a great place to shop  Its not their fault really  but sad nonetheless ,?
979574,El Nopal (Quick Review)El Nopal is just okay   Their menu is kept basic with a few combos  tacos  burritos  and entrees   I didnt find anything special about their Mexican food  However  I did enjoy the 3 Item Omelet  Service was pretty good when we were the only guests   Overall  the food was just okay ,?
979988,Elaborate set and costumes   Visually stunning and the story line was very easy to follow which you cannot say for every Cirque show   The seats have speakers in the headrest which is a little creepy at first but actually very cool   Due to the accident  there was a revised ending but we had never seen KA before ao it didnt affect our opinion   Overall  great productions and I have seen most of the Cirque shows on the strip ,?
980286,Elegant crown molding  pink marble  cool use of glass to enclose rooms the atmosphere is nice  Almost Starckish with the Alice in Wonderland tall booths We had the Winterliscious menu  Excellent Valpolicella and Sauvignon Blanc wines by the glass   but the food disapointed  Tender grilled calamari starter was nice  but lobster bisque was beyond bland  Chicken was so dry that my roots of my teeth ached from unclenching my jaw Chocolate chunk creme brulee was sooo decadent during consumption  but caused sugary tummy ache up until this morning  Such a shame that the gorgeous interior defeats the food quality ,?
980315,Elegant looking restaurant and great tasting food! We got the BBQ salmon that was absolutely delicious and the other entree was a cheeseburger with the best fries I have ever tasted in my life  Prices werent too bad especially for being on the Strip  The total bill came out to around $40  I will definitely go back every time I am in Vegas ,?
980759,Elie does my hair and he is absolutely amazing! He is so talented  detailed and personable! Ive received so many compliments on my Brazilian blow out and highlights! Thank you for my beautiful hair Elie!,?
980778,Elijah has taken phenomenal pictures for me  He has helped with my business photos  as well as  personal head shots  He is very reliable and doesnt bail or cancel last minute  One thing he is great at is capturing moments for a wonderful candid shot! I would recommend to anyone and will definitely hire him again!,?
981830,Embarrassingly I have been here probably close to 100 times  At least 20 of the 30 lbs I need to lose is from Barros  My wife and staff tell me I need to stay away   I cant  The all meat pizza and huge dining area are as irresistible as a cute puppy with a red Christmas bow around it  The price is great  Too good which is probably why they just raised it a bit  Still a smokin deal! Police officers often congregate to eat here  Seriously  All of them  Like at least 50 at a time  Ive never felt more safe and satisfied in my life  If you are a wanted criminal  come buy them a round of pizza  confess your crimes and Ill bet they let you off easy ,?
981841,Embarrassingly overpriced for what it is  Its candy  fer cryin out loud  $12 99/lb for Hot Tamales or Jelly Bellys? Really? I cant believe so many of these places are opening up along the strip  Is there really a need for a shop in the Miracle Mile shops AND Paris right next door? Really? REALLY?,?
982082,Emilianos has always been our favorite  We were so excited for this location to open  The food was delicious as always  but the ambiance and decor left a little to be desired  We went for dinner and the  main dining was so brightly lit and it just didnt seem very cozy like the other locations  My husband and I joked that we felt like we were at Hofbrauhaus with how open and bright it was  The music was also very loud and with the height of the ceiling and number of people in the dining room  it made it somewhat hard to carry on a conversation ,?
982334,Eminently reasonable prices  good attitude  average service on busy times  but restaurant could benefit from a serious hygiene overhaul and regular cleaning  Tables  seats and hot pot stove controls feel sticky  as if they havent been wiped in a while  Stove plate coverings are thrown to the floor when they serve and placed back on tables when you first come in  Condiments rack is disheveled  Raw meat quality and maintenance has dropped since my last visit  I couldnt enjoy my meal despite the droves of customers enjoying Shaanxis alternate offering of northcentral Chinese delicacies The lady owner is as friendly and welcoming as the first day she opened  We wish her the best and hope she improves on sanitary conditions  which are critical when serving raw food in a hotpot place ,?
982370,Emmanuel all the way!!!! He explained every single process to me  I showed him a picture  he set expectations  and he came through! The cut and color are on point  So professional and funny ,?
982570,Employee was nice about it  but I am leaving a poor review because this location wouldnt take a coupon we had for a BIRTHDAY buy one get one free  That is not good for your business  I would respectfully suggest you tell the employees to inform the patrons how to change the location of the coupon for the next time  and still honor what they came in with because thats what good businesses do  Thanks,?
983039,Employees say they dont work on commission  Theres a kid play area so that adults can have an ease of mind when shopping for furniture  Kyle in the bedding area was really helpful and took the time to explain in detail  Although I didnt end up buying a new mattress  I walked away with a nice 9 piece dining set  Delivery was fast and on time with no issues  Great customer service!,?
983281,Empty restaurant on a Saturday night in Vegas   Highly suspect   Our waiter introduces himself and explains that the restaurant is tapasstyle Chinese cuisine   In order to properly feed our group of 10  we would have to order 2 of everything   The culprits: Baby back ribs w/ honey tamarind glaze ($10)   These were ok   Nothing special   Spicy Thai shrimp with garlic basil lettuce wraps ($10)   A little too salty for our liking   Calamari w/ serrano peppers ($15): this was probably one of my favorites   Crispy with some heat to it   Lemon chicken ($21): pass   pass   pass   Lastly my other favorite of the evening was steak served over grilled rice (similar to grilled onigiri)   Delicious   Overall  the food was just ok   For the price that we paid per item  I expected better   Service could also have been better   Considering the restaurant was empty  youd expect more attention from your server ,?
983565,Enchiladas Verdes tomatillo sauce has so much sugar in it Salsa has so much sugar in it  Tastes like a preserved chili sauce  Gringa tastes like it has cumin or curry in it  Tocos Al pastor were good enough Maybe this is fusion food? This food is so confusing ,?
984299,Ended up with a NOT So pretty kitty  While the name and decor is super cute  thats about it   I have been getting waxed for about three years so when I came to the pretty kitty I was NOT a newbie   This was by far the worst I have ever had  normally I dont experience any pain with my waxing   After my experience at the pretty kitty I was swollen and in pain for 34 days   Not to mention I still had stragglers hanging around and they are quite pricey  Not sure what happened here but wont ever go back   I have since found the best ever place in Vegas and now have a very happy and pretty box ,?
984609,Energia is welcoming and hospitable to new students! I came in yesterday for my first Spin class  and was immediately greeted and shown around the club  I felt like I had been going there forever! The Spin class teacher was friendly! She was good  although I did find the screen to be nauseainducing at times! Really cool idea  and Im sure its just me who was having trouble watching it  Overall  a good sweat! I think I would prefer to Spin at a specialty (spin only) club  but I am trying another class this evening (Kettlebell) since I liked Energia so much! Keep up the good work  :),?
985058,Enjoyable PanAsian joint near Bloor and Yonge  Showed up at noon and we were seated promptly and courteously  Their lunch menu offers lots of specials: sashimi  bento boxes  rolls  and noodles  My shanghai noodles were excellent  but my date regretted the lemon chicken she ordered  Service was topnotch and prices seemed reasonable Obligatory Title Pun: OJA Horses! (Terrible  I know )Menu Readability: The lunch menu featured pictures of everything  which I like Need to mention: A good pick for lunch if you work in the area  Not rammed like the overrated Spring Rolls next door What this place teaches me about myself: Not every restaurant title is opun to humourous modification ,?
985077,Enjoyable area to have an in car picnic  Want to take some photos? Make sure to bring a zoom lens  Better at night because of the downtown Charlotte city lights in the background as the planes take off and go in ,?
985445,Enjoyed a delicious lunch at our favorite West Valley resort   The Asian Wrap is the perfect summer light meal that is fresh and tasty   Jessica made the lunch experience even better with her attentive  friendly service!  This is the place to go on hot summer days to cool off  watch golfers practice their putting skills  take in a variety of sports in their many TVs  and relax for a leisurely meal ,?
986291,Enjoyed dinner here recently  Food was very good as was the service  A little pricey but good place to eat,?
986655,Enjoyed my dining experience  Food  atmosphere and service were good  Will be returning ,?
987060,Enjoyed our meal there  We went with friends and it was our first time there  The waiter was very attentive  He answered questions we had about the menu items  I tried the sea bass and my husband had steak  We also had crazy good Brussels sprouts as an appetizer  They had a really good peach crumble for dessert  Id recommend it for an off the strip neighborhood experience in Vegas ,?
987282,Enjoyed the Donut  Cool laid back environment very airy and light hearted  Great for family  dates and etc  Donuts were reasonably priced for what you got  We tried the chocolate with sprinkles   Will be back,?
987350,Enjoyed the Sunday $25 brunch buffet   Omlet/eggs any style station   Ham on carving station every Sunday   For $10 more endless sparking wine   Worth the $25 bucks go check this place out fun  the coffee very robust ! no eggs benedict but hey everything else was worth it ,?
987678,Enjoyed the food!  Beef biriyani  naan  goat curry  eggplant bhurta  butter chicken  paneer pakora  I will go back to this place again!,?
987927,Enjoyed the service typically expected for a nice Vegas restaurant   I ate the rib eye steak cooked medium and was mouth watering   The portion was big which I had to take home   The environment is great for a dinner party  but may be loud for a date (we dined on a Wed night) ,?
988014,Enjoyed the varied lunch brunch menu  My friend & I shared 2 different sandwiches: pastrami & crab  Both were delicious with tasty fries   Our server  Dorothy  was very customerfocused  She was attentive to our needs although it was crowded  My only objection was the noise level which is enhanced by the concrete floor & no sound attenuation  I plan on returning for dinner which is served Thursday  Saturday nights ,?
988489,Eno Vino is by far my favorite restaurant in the Madison area  It beats out all the hot spots surrounding the Capital and State Street  As a result  my fiancee and I became regulars at this place Eno Vino is a tapasinfluenced Italian restaurant/winery  It offers a wide variety of small plates  flat breads  and wines  and the menu changes each season (with the more popular items staying on)  This was good for us because  as regulars  we wouldnt get bored of the same small plates each time we dined at Eno Vino  My favorite small plates are the braised pork belly  the hangar steak  and their different styles of scallops  Im also a huge fan of their free bread  What makes it good is that each time Ive been there  the spread/pastes have been different and delicious I highly recommend Eno Vino  Youll have a great experience with food and quality service ,?
988893,Entering a repurpsed wood panneled space  you are eye to eye with the chefs  A fully stocked bar is available for your pleasure  Choices which include healthy tasty menu items will make your tummy happy  An eager staff eager to please  makes Wild a great night out for drinks  tasty food and great service My tomato soup was creamy and tasty  my gluten free chicken tikka pasta was well prepared and yummy The gluten free pizza was crunchy and gooey in all the right ways All around great new resturant in downtown Las Vegas!,?
990757,Erica did my Brazilian lip  & brow  It was my first time getting waxed at this establishment  And I am not horribly impressed   She had to go over my labias several times to catch the strays  Yet there were still several strays  I also still had several strays on the inside of my thighs  Lip & brow were done nicely  I wish I could give 3 5 stars ,?
991062,Erika was the best server weve ever had at a sushi restaurant  He helped us with explaining the whole menu and side menu  That includes appitizerers and main courses  I definitely recommend Erik when it comes to sushiya ,?
991220,Erin was our bartender at 3 pm today  Damn  she knows how to make a kick ass Old Fashioned  Definitely coming back to this place  Awesome drinks and food ,?
991230,Erins Snug Irish Pub is just that snug  The ambiance is really great for groups  as you can get your own cozy room  The service was excellent  but the food wasnt mind blowing  The dinner rolls  however  were to die for ,?
992994,Even online express check in was done in the morning  it made no difference in getting a reasonable room checked in at night   The socalled express checkin required you to wait at least 25 minutes with only a few people working at snail pace over the counters   The room was sizable but has a few old and small furnitures   It was like a warehouse dressed up at the night of Halloween  Then it got better with blinking desk light making zzzz  noise  coupled with running toilet as soon as one flushed the toilet   Numerous phone calls for help were made  but no help ever arrived at the time near 11pm   Stripe hotels at this price level during the week offer lots more   Dont think this is a value hotel   Its below motel 6 level  and do watch out for bed bugs ,?
993166,Even after you tell 3 people that you are not interested and have joined another gym    they wont quit calling  I have asked the to take me off their call list     even speaking with the general manager    who said it was not his job to take me off the call list  Had to block them ,?
995891,Even with all the negative press  when I came into this Chipotle it was packed   The line moved pretty quickly and the food was Chipotle as I know it ,?
996004,Even without eating the delicious desserts its such fun sitting at the bar watching everything be created  We had the Mars with wine pairing and it was SO good  Perfect match  Will definitely be back ,?
996098,Eventhough wait about 2 hrs  you will not disappointed  The taste of food very good  Kobe beef  Prime beef  Shrimp cocktail   Goose  lamb rack  many choices of dessert  different type of breads  Sushi bars and different type of pasta  The staff very friendly and helpful ,?
997396,Ever since the buyout this place is awful  The people in the front are rude and dont call back when they say they will  I am still waiting for a call back from March   its just run unprofessionally  The maintenance doesnt know what theyre doing  they dont know which apartment they need to be at and after I called to tell the front office they came back and tried to get into my apartment  The gates barely ever work anymore  they do maintenance on the pools and dont tell the tenants or even place a notice on the gates to the pool  Why do I pay so much in rent when they cant seem to keep things working or even do the right thing and call back  Im super disappointed because my sister and I used to love living here and now Im pretty sure were not going to renew our lease  Dont waste youre money here ,?
997465,Ever since the reddit post about how a student found bugs in their sashimi  I was hesitant on coming back to Itamae  But it has been over half a year now  and I was craving AYCE sushi so I went  and it honestly wasnt bad at all!Their sashimi is much better now  more fresh and very delicious  Their sushi and rolls are pretty good  I also like how theyve added new items to their menu  like two dimsum dishes  random but good  I recommend their salmon and red tuna sashimi  eel sushi  and black dragon roll! The mutton skewers and short ribs were also really good The ambiance and decor of the place is also really nice  The cutlery and dishes they use are nice and the iPads are great! Theyve even gotten new stands for the iPads that makes the iPads super convenient to use and share among people at your table ,?
997532,Ever since they opened up this dutch a few years ago its been my goto coffee spot  I recently moved away for almost a year & came back  They are still the same! The employees make the long lines go quick with witty small talk  No matter what time of day the drink will always taste the same  Their pastries are also really good!,?
998210,Every Sunday morning I crave a nice brunch & I have been very disappointed recently! Verses definitely did not disappoint me! The food was delicious especially the Eggs Benedict with foie gras! Very beautiful setting as well!,?
998274,Every Time we are n pittsburgh we go here to get our italian sausage   They do and incredible job   and the customer service is hands down fantastic    ,?
999735,Every other hotel we called was full up from last night (at 6:00AM)  We needed to find a room and FAST! They could get us a room before noon (which beat the 3pm check in others were offering)  They let us help ourselves to the continental breakfast and hang by the pool until our room was ready  Fast  friendly service  definitely looking out for the best interest of the customers (unlike EVERY SINGLE HOTEL ON THE STRIP)  It is about a mile off the strip  but theres a shuttle to take you there and back until 10:30PM and after that  its an easy walk with a friend  kitty corner form Hard Rock Cafe  Very clean rooms with amazing pullout couches  VERY REASONABLY PRICED! If youre looking for service and quiet and a peaceful getaway (still close to the strip) THIS IS THE PLACE TO BE!,?
1000686,Every table was dirty when we walked in and no one cleaning  any of them   The menu station  was disgusting!  It took 5 minutes  for someone  to come over to us   We were about to walk out   Clean this place up guys!!!!!,?
1000928,Every time I ask a question they have no idea what I am talking about  Not very knowledgable  Last time I tried to enter the store the alarm went off (i must of had something still magnetically  tagged on me) and the shop keeper blocked me from entering  She would not let me in  I understand why she might of wanted to accompany me in the store to make sure I was not stealing since the alarm would go off again when I leave but that is not what she did  She was very rude and they lost my business ,?
1001582,Every time I come here  I leave extremely full and satisfied The decor is very fun with pigs and jokes everywhere  The service is friendly and efficient I tend to have the meat baskets  but this time I tried Daves Favorite burger  It has bacon  jack cheese  Rich and Sassy sauce  and the regular burger toppings  I put a little Texas Pit sauce on top  and it was extraordinary!They offer a lot of different meats  sides  and sauces  so there are tons of combinations that you can try  Portion size is generous I will be back again for sure ,?
1002049,Every time I come to Wahsun Im glad I did   The restaurant is small and plain   The management takes only cash   The food however  is very authentic and always excellent   This is a mom and pop restaurant   Pop cooks and Mom waits tables and cashiers   Mom  also named Rose  is a very delightful woman who makes our meal almost as enjoyable as the food   The cost is quite reasonable   Roast duck for less than 8$?,?
1002721,Every time I go here  the service sucks  food is old  and they always forget something  The drive thru set up is a cluster  This is why this company is going under  Corporate America at its best!!!,?
1003954,Every time I shop here I have to be prepared to stop at another store  This store is either completely out of water  salad or other produce  or reduced sugar almond milk (if you can even find where its stocked)  Seriously     after 5pm is the worst but dont be fooled  The morning can be just as disappointing ,?
1004479,Every time I walk past this place I say I need to check it out  Well I did today  The guy behind the counter recommended the Chicago Dog  Said its there most popular item  Im from the Chicago area so I bought it  NEVER buy one! Its the worst Ive ever had  I didnt even finish it  Waste of $5 93,?
1004602,Every time Im in Las Vegas (which is about 56 times a year) I HAVE to eat here  If I could give them more than 5 stars I would  Ive had sushi from San Francisco all the way to Brooklyn and all the places in between  not a single place can hold a candle to Ra Sushi  The sushi is fresh and made in a speedy fashion  I love the the Ami Ebi  The unagi is fresh and has a great taste to it  The crunchy shrimp tempura roll is delicious  The main reason I go every time is the mango lobster rolls  you wont find these any where else but here  Also  if you are not a big fan of seaweed I believe they give you the option of using rice/soy paper instead  It worked out perfectly for my sister in law  a first time sushi eater ,?
1006485,Every two weeks I am transformed into a pretty little princess because of Brandy  She is the only nail technician Ive found that listens to what I want and always gives me quality nails  My past experiences with other nail technicians havent always been so pleasant  I always struggled with my nails breaking shortly after I got them done  language barriers  sore fingers  being pressured into an add on  etc  Brandy has cured me from all those worries! Ive been seeing Brandy for many years now and we have been on a nail journey together  Im someone who is rough with my hands  always in a pair of gloves for work  and I still have the nicest nails when I go in for a fill  What really floors me is how creative she is! It doesnt surprise me that shes been featured in several nail pro magazines  Let me say how grateful I am to have such an amazing nail technician! I highly recommend Brandy!,?
1006639,Every weekend my friends and I hit up citizen public house after we work on restoring my friends airstream    I love their happy hour  everything has been amazing (minus their ramen  its spicy but is missing any flavor profile) and I always have to get their original chopped salad with double salmon! Their barrel aged cocktails are delicious as well ,?
1007097,Everybody knows a DMV day is never a good one  so my expectations were already pretty low to begin with  I usually go to the other location  but was on this side of town  We were sitting outside to eat and they have speakers outside to hear numbers being called Get this: you have ONLY 45 SECONDS to get to the counter  or theyll pass you along Guess it was a sign from above because the next lady we got was a blessing  She handled everything and made the trip not as expensive!! I forgot her name  but she was at counter 26 :) They have wifi  but youll end up using your data  Id say bring a good book since itll be awhile  Only reason why Im giving it a 3 for the service the lady provided  Ill stick to the other location next time ,?
1008193,Everyone has already said it all   Solid but unmemorable diner food  in a place that is divinely Vegas Its a mustsee   Ambience is 6 stars The rest doesnt matter much   Its edible   You wont get food poisoning   Good drunk food alternative to Dennys   Worth the trip even if its out of the way ,?
1009161,Everyone is always so helpful  I took my beginning foil class there and they are always willing to continue teaching me  Gerry has been awesome from the first time we came to the shop just to look aroundshe got me hooked! Also  just took a hummingbird suncatcher class with Patty Jo and totally enjoyed it! Nikki  Lauren and Nola (everyone) have helped me choose glass for projects  Im new and addicted ,?
1009701,Everyone is very unhappy with this place  Heres the deal  The property is worth millions   And it will be shutting down soon   The land is going to be sold    So there is no reason to put money into it   I think the driving range is solid  And if sold alcohol it would prolly do better ,?
1010284,Everyone posts about the fantastic tacos    so Im gonna post about the amazing spirits! The Cinnamon Margarita and the Cherry Sour are amazing thanks to the creativity of their bar manager Laura! We love this place!,?
1010969,Everyone was complaining about parking  but I thought parking was really easy to find   LOL  I got the smores  Shouldve replaced it with Vietnamese coffee ice cream because the double chocolate in the smores was so over the top chocolate! The graham crackers and marshmallows did complement the ice cream My boyfriend got he rocky road freeze  I wish I got that because that was really good  You could taste the almonds and chocolate in it  My only negative about this place was that the ice cream melts pretty quick I would definitely come back!,?
1012212,Everything I order at the oyster bar is always good  never dissatisfied  I always go to the one at the Palace location  The pan roast is a must try  The only issue I have is the wait  whether I come at 6  or at midnight  or at 3am the wait is minimum hour and a half  I always wait knowing what awaits my palate BUT cant you do something about that? Cant you at least think of a better way of having your customer reserve their spot and if theyre not back by the time a spot is available then whoever is there gets it? That is your only flaw! Dont you want to be perfect in service just like your food?,?
1012319,Everything I try here is my new favorite!  Im not a coffee connoisseur but the coffee here is on another level compared to anything Ive had  I appreciate that I am supporting a local business  The service is outstanding as well!,?
1012632,Everything Ive tried has been delicious  the lemon squares  cupcakes  white chocolate popcorn  And  for my birthday I had a German Chocolate cake it was the best German Chocolate Cake Ive every had  a definite winner     soooo moist and sooo good!!  Glad they moved to Scottsdale ,?
1013216,Everything about this dining experience started out really well  Atmosphere was good  noise level was good  wine was good  When the food came  all our foods were very visually appealing  and the taste was really good For appies we ordered the mussels  the bacon on pork belly  and the potato rolls  For our mains  we ordered the scallops  a few of the roasted chickens  some ravioli  and the bison  Everything was really good  not too saucy  and tasted really good However  the reason why it wasnt a 5 star rating was because the temperature of the entire building was boiling! Its the middle of July in Calgary and a little air conditioning is much needed in a place that has a wood burning rotisserie and coal grill  Way too hot to be considered comfortable Especially after the period of waiting for dessert  the heat just bathes you in discomfort ,?
1014430,Everything from the hostess that greeted us  to our service  to the manager  very unpleasant Our food took forever to get  and when it was finally  delivered the warm items were cold  Impossible to get refills or any service of this matter  Food was nothing special ,?
1014438,Everything from the moment you walk in is amazing  The decor  the hospitality and the food  This is trully a hidden gem and it is slightly off the beaten path  The first time I was there was in the evening and the gorgeous patio knocked my socks off  We had people from out of town and they were impressed with the beautiful patio area with its open southwest theme  When inside  the theme continues  Friendly staff  knowledgeable waitress and great food  I had the green chillie burrito and found it to have the perfect level of spiceiness  Overall service was good however my wifes dish took an extra 2 minutes to get to table  Otherwise good presentation and good food for all  I will definitely be going back and I can not give a higher recommendation in all of Chandler  Even downtown ,?
1014574,Everything her is amazing and its so damn clean!! Even the bathrooms!!! Real authentic Mexican food and fast!!!,?
1015712,Everything is delicious here!! My favorites are the Kabuli naan  Garlic Naan  tandoori chicken  chicken tikka masala  palak paneer  and samosas but you cant really go wrong  The buffet is purposely made mild so everyone can eat it  and its easy to add spice but I usually order buffet and then one a la carte dish so I can still have one medium spice dish  I love how everyone there is so attentive with the food  service  and cleanliness  I will definitely be back!,?
1015961,Everything is good except the tortas just feel plain for some reason   My kids love eating here  you cant go wrong dam tortas keeping me from giving them 5 stars!,?
1016254,Everything is made fresh to order rather than sitting in hot plates waiting to be served  and the portion sizes are intimidating for many of the dishes  Not the typical mall food court place  definitely where I go when Im here ,?
1016538,Everything is so tasty  the juices are so fresh  I bought a litre of juice for a lower price than a bottle in other store  and the owner did a  It more and gave it to me for free to taste it  Highly recommended !,?
1017690,Everything up in here is delicious!! I especially like the chicken sandwich  The environment is cool  Fun games to play in the back  Can be difficult to get a spot to sit at times but worth the short wait ,?
1018240,Everything was delicious   have not been here for awhile and missed seeing the sirloin steak on the menu   Ordered the steak sampler with scallops   melt in your mouth goodness  Our waitress was outstanding and a wonderful dinning experience was had by everyone   Always end the meal with my grandsons favorite smores dessert   fun and yummy too  I was just a bit disappointed that on Veterans Day there was not at least a dish of ice cream offered for our veterans  we had two at our table ,?
1018251,Everything was delicious and fresh!  Nice atmosphere  pleasant customer service   Had one of the tastiest cups of chai   Enjoyed the flavors so much ordered more to go!,?
1018273,Everything was delicious especially the fresh squeezed lemonade with honey is on spot!!!,?
1018401,Everything was delicious  ambiance is beautiful  cocktails are amazing  and we had fabulous service from Michael  Not very many restaurants have this level of service anymore  so it felt like a much more expensive dining experience  We will definitely be back  We had the burrata appetizer (try the sundried tomatoes)  pear and arugula salad (my favorite)  and the spaghetti and meatballs and the short rub ravioli that everyone raves about  Im obsessed with the pineapple upside down cake  It was also very refreshing to see an elegant manager making rounds on the restaurant and waiting on people  he keeps a wonderful restaurant! Cheers!,?
1018684,Everything was extremely fresh from the corn tortillas tomatoes fish tacos  Its a little hole in the wall but definitely a hidden gem! I had the fish tacos and a bean tostada  Even the tortilla chips tasted homemade and fresh  I would definitely recommend and definitely be back!,?
1018769,Everything was fantastic  Service was a little challenging  most likely due to the size of our group  but far more positive to point out than negative  The filet was incredible and cooked to perfection  The blueberry cheesecake melted in your mouth  Its a definite must go for a great steak dinner that wont disappoint,?
1020391,Everything was wonderful  service  food  cocktails!Hubby gave the 1/2lb burger 9 5   Good beef I had the French dip  very tasty  but pricy at $14 Overall experience was good I would come back and recommended ,?
1020463,Everything we ate was fabulous!! One in our party is gluten free and her pizza was fantastic (mushroom and truffle oil)  I had the borrata and pesto pizza and another had arugula and pear  Our waiter  Matt  was very knowledgeable about the menu and about the wine  Im originally from Austin and am used to a wider selection of beers but other than that  top notch!,?
1021444,Everything you want in a shopping center is here  No need to go anywhere else if youre in town  I come here all the time for a one stop buy anything and everything I want spot  Car show every saturday  Home Depot  Ross  Target  Pizzaria  Sweet Tomatoes  Toys R Us  Filibertos  Good Will  Auto Zone  Michaels  Hooters  Taco Bell  Dunkin Donuts  Mcdonalds  Gamestop  Buffalo Wild Wings  Hobby Lobby  Baskin Robbins  Classy Italian Restaurant  Petco  Dollar Store  Mongolian Grill  Dennys  Popeyes  Arbys  Red Robin  Payless  Famous Footwear  Sprint  TMobile  Verizon  Conns  IFly Indoor Skydiving  Octane Racing  Roadhouse Cinemas  Chipotle and more ,?
1022609,Everytime i come in here the employees are so friendly and helpful!  One of our best local fast and delicious eateries   Next time you are close by stop in and ask for Q she will make sure you get exactly what you are craving ,?
1023042,Evoke is a great salon!  Love the drinks menu  the head massage  the environmental program  and the stylists are great to talk and relate to  plus they do a great haircut   In the past  Ive hated getting my hair cut because generally the hairdressers Ive had are overly hipstery   But here  I can actually talk about normal things  like dishwashers  suburban Italian restaurants and wedding officiants   Ive had both Jon and Ashley  and theyve done an amazing job   They are honest with what they can do  are super quick  and Ive received so many compliments on how shiny my hair looks for weeks afterwards! The only reason why I have docked a star  the pricing was very shocking to me when I got to the cash register  $120 including tax and tip  YIKES  I thought it would be closer to $75   But seriously  for the haircuts and conversations alone  its well worth it!  I will be returning!  (they also do complimentary bang/fringe trims  like Aveda ),?
1023053,Evolve Wellness Spa is wonderful  I called and left a message about booking a same day appointment before the spa opened and received a call back within the hour from Beth   She was able to fit me in the same day and was very gracious on the phone   Upon arriving to Evolve  I received a warm and prompt reception from Gabrielle  Darius is one of the most expert massage therapists I have encounteredand I have received massages around the world   The massage left me feeling a million times better than when I first arrived  He is knowledgeable and very clearly explains his technique and treatment suggestions   Following the massage I was welcomed into the relaxation room where the dim lights and comfortable reclining chaise lounges were a perfect accompaniment to my treatment   Gabrielle also provided some delicious relaxation tea  too ,?
1023213,Ew     You know when I first walked in it didnt look appetizing and after trying the 2way which is chilli on spaghetti and the chili cheese fries  I was solidified in my thoughts    Its horrible quality chilli and they put too much cheese for me  It just doesnt taste good  I will never be back!!,?
1023241,Eww!  Thats all I can say about this meal this evening   We have never have had a bad meal here  however  tonight was an exception   What bothered us most was the waiter acted like our complaint was a personal attack against him   Maybe I should be complaining to the management about the customer service  instead ,?
1024012,Exceeded my expectations again! Needed to have three ceiling fans installed  Arrived on time and got them installed even though the existing electrical boxes presented some interesting challenges  But Handy Heross met the challenge and got them installed ,?
1024405,Excelente!!!!! I had a great experience at Xola  great service and great food  100% authentic Mexican food and test  We ordered appetizer Trio  the Duck confit tacos and the Arrechera everything was awesome!!! I definitely will come back!,?
1024601,Excellent  first time experience today at Max Health Center  I booked and went to appointment within an hour  Thankfully they were able to fit me in  Deep tissue massage before by Anthony was excellent  he released some spots my current therapist has missed  Nice to be relaxed a bit before adjustment  Dr Ford was great  perfect adjustment  not to agressive  but not too light either   Nice bedside manor as well! Plus! Carolee at front desk was very pleasant and informative too  Thank you again for the last minute appointment and the TLC Clean   professional  and A all the way!,?

1025423,Excellent Croissants and pastries  It provides a clean and warm atmosphere  They gotta fix the open refrigerator though  It makes a loud noise when it reboots ,?
1026014,Excellent Hummus  lots of options to make your bowl  plate or salad  I love this place,?
1026198,Excellent Italian food! I tried the famous polenta fries    sooo good! My husband hates polenta  but he loved them too!  Excellent service  we had a waitress named Patrizzia and she was awesome!,?
1026350,Excellent Korean BBQ not far from the strip  Beef carpaccio and marinated spare ribs are stand out  Nice sides and good Thai iced tea  Friendly and helpful servers  If this is your thing  you cant go wrong ,?
1026409,Excellent Latin restaurant near 43rd ave and Bell rd   behind the Taco Bell small family run Ecuadorian  Peruvian  and Columbian style Cafe the Tamales are among the best I have had  I had a combination plate with Carne Asada  whole beans  fried plantains  a sausage  a slice of deep fried pork belly with skin  a plantain fritter  a fried egg  rice  avocado  and aji relish the whole beans were amazing   the ahi chili relish hot and tasty  the steak had just the right amount of seasoning and flavor  A huge amount of food Give Mi Comida a try  Your tummy will be happy ,?

1026826,Excellent Peruvian food  Ive been to Peru and frequent Peruvian restaurants in AZ  The ceviche mixto is magnificent! The saltado is still my favorite dish  I ordered to go  so I missed the beautiful presentation  but the quality was amazing  The chicha morada was good  slightly less sweet than others Ive had  which made it even better  We aso ordered the fish with pisco sauce and cheese topped with crab and shrimp  which was a large portion making me feel like it was worth the cost  I would recommend this restaurant  High quality meat and fish were used  Clearly high quality ingredients  The saltiness was as should be of saltado ,?
1026907,Excellent Pizza and the restaurant/bar has a very fun parents basement vibe   We had two pizzas  one with the pesto sauce  and one with red sauce   Both with homemade sausage  as well as a variety veggies   Both were excellent   Crust was crisp and flavorful ,?

1029145,Excellent auto buying experience! Kevin was most accommodating explaining the features of the car and to work with through the buying process  The price was more than fair  no sales pressure AT ALL  The tradein for my former vehicle was also more than fair  I dread the car buying experience but this was the first time in forty years that I can say that it was a great experience  No buyers remorse when home  total satisfaction  I highly recommend considering  Fairway Auto Wholesale when searching for a vehicle ,?
1029492,Excellent beer selection with a small bar in the back for you to sit back and enjoy draft beer  They have a couple of other tables in there as well  If you are looking for a certain beer this is a good place to look ,?
1029703,Excellent bread  excellent LEAN meat (I hate it when I get a disgusting piece of fat in there   none to be found at Pops!)  and the same traditional toppings as youll find at Pats or Genos right in the city of brotherly love I love that there is no indoor seating (its in an old Wienerschnitzel building) because it adds to the character and uniqueness of the place  which I am always on the look out for The sides are not the best or the cheapest  but hey  you came here for the sandwich ,?
1029832,Excellent breakfast place in Henderson  Food is excellent! Great atmosphere! Lucky we have it in Henderson because we have too many chain restaurants  The only reason I didnt give it 5 stars is because there is a wait and we found out the hard way that you can call in and hold a table ahead of time  Next time we go here we know to call ahead ,?
1030209,Excellent brunch lunch our waiter was impeccable Jeremy i think his name was   Aa man who works hard and it shows   Polite courteous and on point   We ate outside every day   was well priced good food great service worth the walk from Caesars,?
1030280,Excellent brunch  Came to the neighborhood to try Lady Marmalade and came here instead of waiting in line  This was a great choice  I enjoyed a Perfect spicy Caesar  and the eggs Benny with pork and bbq sauce while watching the line of chilly folks waiting outside for their brunch next door  Very friendly waitress /bartender as well!,?

1031899,Excellent communication and customer service  Found them on Google and took a chance   Was shocked he kept going during a thunderstorm by putting away his vacuum  grabbing what he needed and jumping inside my car to keep cleaning from the inside ,?
1031960,Excellent company to do business with! They help me design my company logo and did an amazing rap on my truck! If youre in need of a wrap on your vehicle these are the people to use!,?

1035296,Excellent experience with Tiffany   I live in Maggie Valley where I get Solar Nails   Tiffany originally said they didnt do solar but after discussing with another technician they agreed they could fulfill my request    I was a bit anxious but decided to go ahead   I was pleasantly surprised   Tiffany is the best nail tech Ive encountered in my 70 years   She is an artist and perfectionist   Ask for her if you want an outstanding experience   Reason not a 5 star was due to the fact that when I first arrived no one was sure they had the right product to accommodate my request ,?
1035320,Excellent experience with this company  I couldnt be more pleased   My AC quit working last night at 5 pm and I had no idea who to call   I called Cooler Tymes based on all of the good Yelp reviews and got an answer right away   He knew what my problem was right away from my description and asked me to send him photos of the unit   He was willing to be at my house at 6 am this morning with the parts in hand   He quickly fixed it and still took the time to do the job right   Very personable  friendly and professional   Very fair price too  I was afraid the repair might cost thousands but it was only hundreds   I will recommend this company to everyone ,?
1035569,Excellent experience   Thanks for the great stories  Glenn! You rock!  Also  great lunch options for vegetarians ,?
1035864,Excellent farmtotable meals  with a garden right in the back parking lot (as wel las the owners house)!Dishes are inventive and fun  whether they be the appetizer selections or the main dishes   Craft cocktails were also well put together and their Happy Hour menu is quite reasonable with plenty of choices (both meat and meatless options) Experience here (from beginning to end) was good both times weve been   A bit on the pricey side (for what it is)  but I think that is probably offset by the quality of the ingredients   well worth a visit ,?
1036469,Excellent food  best Ive had in Vegas  And pretty much the only reason Im going to give Tao 2 stars WARNING  if you are a dude  and plan on having dinner with several dudes (i e  bachelor party) at Tao  dont count on getting line passes to get into the nightclub   I went with three friends on Sat  4/21  and after dropping $400 on dinner  we were informed by the HR manager looking hostess that we couldnt get line passes because we threw off the guy to girl ratio at the club  Thats about the worst customer service Ive ever experienced in my life    way to take care of your customers! We might as well have eaten at some fast food joint and started waiting in line at 8pm with the other sunglasses wearing jackoffs that infest Vegas these days Oh    and apparently KFed was there the same night having dinner with his posse ,?
1037642,Excellent food and service  I ate the shrimp and it was outstanding    my friends ate the taco bowls and they loved it too    ,?
1037665,Excellent food and service and atmosphere  Problem is extremely expensive food prices  Two lunches with just water should not cost $50  Please lower your prices  We will not be back until prices are lowered ,?
1037848,Excellent food and service! Definitely recommend the Reuben  Salad was fresh  Awesome old time feel  authentic and amazing ,?
1037893,Excellent food and service! I will repeat soon  even though its located far from my place ,?
1038058,Excellent food and service  highly recommend the Walleye! The atmosphere is great with their nautical theme   I also recommend the fried mushrooms   You wont be disappointed!,?
1038231,Excellent food and service   The price was reasonable  the place was clean  the service was excellent and the taste was amazing   I have lived in LA for 25 years   so I know how a great Korean food should taste   This place gets my TWO Thumbs UP!  It is rare I go to dinner after having lunch at a same place   but Dae Jang Keum pulled it off   If you are having dinner  I recommend the combination dinner pack ,?
1038665,Excellent food and service  We had lunch buffet and was great   Attentive service and food was amazing as well,?

1040035,Excellent food! Great portions  taste  service  and especially atmosphere  Staff was friendly  fast  and accommodating for a large group of people  We ordered the lulas  octopus  and shrimp as appetizers  For someone who normally doesnt like octopus  the octopus here was to die for! We also ordered the bitoque and seafood cataplana and its some of the best Portuguese food Ive ever had ,?
1040110,Excellent food! I loved the momo and the Phaksha Khatsa was full of flavor! Will definitely come back here again! Garab was the best!,?

1040753,Excellent food  atmosphere and service  Highly recommended  We ordered a mocajete and it was very flavourful ,?
1041099,Excellent food  excellent service  excellent ambiance and decor  Couldnt have asked for anything more (hey  that rhymes!) I dined with a friend when it was relatively calm and uncrowded  so that could have been why our service was so fabulous  Our waiter was warm and knowledgeable  and the delicious dishes came quickly  You may think  since youre at a more authentic Thai restaurant  that you want to experiment and skip the typical Pad Thai    DO NOT MAKE THAT MISTAKE! Their Pad Thai is like no other    Its just a wonderful  magical medley of tastes that Ive never tasted before  and cant fully explain  nutty  spicy  wheaty  noodley goodness Be aware of their hours  during the week  I believe they close in the afternoon  Its also easy to miss    I walked right past it the first few times!,?
1041557,Excellent food  great service!  I had chef special which was grilled salmon in panang sauce   very spicy just how I like and the man had pad kee Mao  Just excellent all of it  Dessert was green tea mochi and mango with sticky rice    kinda wish someone would wheel barrow me outta here!

1047659,Excellent pizza with fresh ingredients   Thin crispy crust  We had the classic combo  pepperoni  homemade sausage  and various veggies  Good ratio of meat to veggies  While the pizza was really  really good  the cannoli was better  Best cannoli Ive had in the US  Its a pretty small place  maybe 7 tables but you can eat there or take out   The staff was really nice and the place was clean  Definitely low key with plastic table clothes  Maybe not a date place but an excellent pizza joint ,?

They werent doing us any favors at $55 for a corkage fee ,?
1056611,Excellent service   After the dealer told me my problem was worn tires  I brought my car here   The owner  Jeff  diagnosed my 2009 Lexus IS250 over the phone   The same day I brought it in without an appointment so he could verify which wheel bearing was bad   Jeff looked at the car right away and gave me an estimate without charging me for troubleshooting   Later I told Jeff the dealer would cover the repairs because its still under warranty and he was very nice and told me to have the dealer repair it   Very honest and trustworthy business   They have earned my business for any future nonwarranty repairs  I wish I knew about them earlier ,?

1061051,Excellent!  Brandon and Elliott helped us unload a 26 ft Uhaul back in April   They worked very fast and very hard   Friendly  clean cut  respectful  full of energy   Couldnt have asked for a better experience!  The best part we had originally booked Brandon in March  but due to a variety of issues  were unable to close on our house as expected   So we had to cancel with him at the last minute   We kept getting estimates from the bank about when they expected we could get in the house  which were continuously wrong  so we kind of kept stringing him along   Despite our rudeness  he was the nicest  most understanding guy!  We were so glad when we FINALLY got the keys and were finally able to meet this outstanding guy   Dont hesitate to call him youll be glad you did!,?
1061743,Excellent! Ive read through the reviews   if you get there early early      Dana isnt a morning Bird so occasionally her first customers or two may not hear the music that chef mind of hers is worried about all of those lunch people threatening her life over shrimp and grits  shes often running around getting soups started because they are made from scratch  And really dude? Who likes pancakes? Dana makes Belgium waffles from scratch trust me Ive watched her myself! And the syrup bottle     you must have needed a lot of syrup sir because its a 2 gallon bottle    cough  Anyway  great food and good service for a cafe striving to be a restaurant! I know when I go Im gonna wait 30 min but I know when I leave Im gonna be dying to go back soon  Gotta call every Friday for those shrimp and grits and reserve!!!! Talk about yummy,?

1064177,Excellent    Again! Have never been disappointed here and i am pretty hard to please  Waitress suggested med rare rather than rare for rib eye  And was absolutely right  even though i often choose blue Not cheap but very very good,?
1064637,Excepted better food for such an expensive restaurant   Had the beef wellington  note this is served only medium rare which was a bummer   The creamed spinach was wonderful and so was the mac n cheese & stick toffee pudding was amazing but not for $300 for 2 people   Service was great I guess that is what we paid for ,?
1064684,Exceptional Italian dining on the Queensway  Great food  theres nothing on their menu that I wouldnt recommend  When you sit inside you feel immersed in an authentic Italian family dining experience  The staff are great and the bill certainly wont break the bank  Come before 6pm on a Friday or Saturday to avoid a huge line ,?
1065292,Exceptional service and delicious creative food  We ordered the cauliflower bites  kale caesar salad and the Bianca pizza  Everything looked beautiful and tasted even better  Drinks were strong and tasty and dessert was unlike anything Ive had before  Our server asked us a ton of questions and went over the menu patiently with us to make sure we ordered something we would like   The prices werent as high as I expected for a vegan place in yorkville  Its not cheap  but its worth every penny  I left stuffed but feeling good since all of the food is relatively healthy   Its more of a special occasion kind of place for me but Ill definitely return for the next celebration ,?
1065409,Exceptional service on Christmas Eve came out removed a sabotage lock and replaced it with an electronic lock it with keypad very very accommodating very very helpful  Very reasonably priced for the amount of time and attention given ,?
1065907,Exceptionally good patient care; with Avery friendly staff  Would highly recommend to anyone ,?
1065935,Exceptionally mediocre  We used to enjoy this place  but the last few times weve been here the meals have just been passable  With the regular bowl coming in at $13  and without the ability to pile on your own starch (a la YCs)  the value just isnt there  The premade sauces are thick and sugary  and not very tasty  I am also continually frustrated by the presence of a waitstaff    while they do a fine job  its just not necessary when you have to get up to make your own bowl anyway  Fine in a pinch  but overpriced  Head to YCs where you can get soup and wontons included ,?
1066066,Excited for a Fox restaurant to come to Gilbert  First  the service was excellent  Atmosphere was not warm  but it was enjoyable  We had burgers  one basket of onion rings a glass of wine each and some iced tea Burgers came out the way we ordered and were yummy  onion rings were crisp and good but nothing special  We enjoyed the meal but its a little high priced for a burger night out  With tip over $60  Its a tasty and fun place but a serious dent in the average budget   The bathroom being outside was weird ,?
1066173,Excited to get some spanish food  we decided to try this place since its right down the street from where we live  After being sat we waited for about 10 minutes and no one came to great us or take a drink order  another table walked in  There were now 2 tables in the restaurant   Seeing as the other couple was spanish and my girlfriend and I are white the other table was greated immediately and their drink order was taken  The waiter being right behind us could of turned around to ask us for a drink order  but no  He looked at us and walked away  We got up and walked out  We will not be returning,?
1066490,Excuses is our favorite place to meet up to watch the Penguins games when were in town   The food is great  the drinks are inexpensive  and the service is awesome!  There are TVs everywhere so you can catch the game no matter which way youre facing  and a juke box with awesome selections!  Weve always had a good time here!,?
1066938,Expect a wait especially after 6 on Thurs and Fri  Sometimes an hour or longer  I really like the Boom Dip and Pizookie but I try to go during off times cause nothings THAT good ,?
1067975,Expensive but quick! Thats about it   you will pay  in some cases double but sometimes my time is worth it    Hell I am too impatient and I know it!,?
1068684,Expensive  but worth it for the affocado We didnt try any of the chocolate or sweetswe mostly came for the affocado  which is espresso poured over gelato  The coffee was terrific and the gelato melted smoothly into the espresso  Delicious!One really cool thing about this place in the Distillery is that you can watch them make their chocolate in the labs  Its really interesting to watch and its a good place to chill out ,?
1068998,Expensively delicious!  The food is absolutely delicious for vegetarian style   You need to be rich to be able to afford to eat healthy   Who knew vegetarian food could so good and so expensive ,?
1069473,Expert Flooring installed wood flooring on my stairs and landing along with new carpeting in the upstairs bedrooms   The end result looks stunning   My friend was renting the house from me at the time of the installation and had only great things to say about the installation crew   She has recommended Expert Flooring to her friends and I have done the same ,?
1069620,Exploring my local area    The baristas here have been super friendly  I came in wanting to check out the local coffee shops and also wanted to expand my coffee knowledge  From behind the counter came nothing but smiles and good conversation  and coffee knowledge!  as I sat sipping my Americano   Great atmosphere    I feel like a lot of the folks who have come in might be local but that just makes it feel friendlier  Plenty of tables  good light and free wifi  Nice little outdoor seating area too which is perfect for Arizona in the spring!,?
1070411,Extreem MEH  Lovely on the outside  disappointing on the inside  I saw thing place while driving to the health food store  and thought oh look! I should try this out  Very rarely do I regret purchasing a croissant    but this time I do  Mine was hard  mushing inside and grossly under proofed  Nothing about this was light  flaky or buttery  I didnt even finish it  Sadly  the rewarmed croissants from Starbucks are better  I wont be back  We have far to many other places in town have better pastries  But on that note: why is all the staff at our local pastry places so pissy? Pekara has grumpy face front of house and this place has hipster punk who hates the world running the place alone  Is customer service dead? I wont go back to places that treat customers like a problem  Try a smile once and while guys    it helps ,?
1070719,Extremely bad service  came to the store in late night  we were told the chef is eating dinner  and would took 10 min  And we said theres no big deal  But we waited like 20 min and the manager told us theres another 20 min  We feel being trolled and the manager said well  you are always welcome to leave       ,?
1070804,Extremely busy  Young girls working the hostess stand need to learn how to multitask and be more polite  Everyone just standing around behind the counter need to help everyone else while they arent busy  There is a wait  but no one is cleaning the open tables  This is sad to watch Update: I am just watching the manager stand around and chat  He hasnt done anything in over 10 minutes ,?
1071274,Extremely disappointed with Alarmforce service  Not only were they not a very useful company  they charged me two years worth of payments for nothing  I called in 2013 to ask when my contract was up  and they advised they would call when it expired  I phoned last week to check in  and was advised that my contract had expired in May 2014  I have not used the service since October 2013  and have paid $28 51 per month since that time for nothing  What a waste of money  and so much for the customer service they claim to deliver  I will never use alarm force again  and will ensure that my friends and family dont get roped in to this horrible service ,?
1072048,Extremely friendly and food taste amazing  but ALL my friends including me had food poisoning afterwards,?
1072161,Extremely friendly staff and a very well thought out Chem Lab Escape Room  Would definitely go back to try one of the other rooms with friends!,?
1072725,Extremely high prices  double that of the No Frills a few blocks east near Sherbourne/Bloor,?
1073140,Extremely oily  The oiliest I have ever had  We had stirred fried veggie and meat  Portion was small  Food was overpriced  Waiter told us it costs on average about 30 each  Seasoning was so strong  Couldnt possibly taste whether the food was fresh or not  Dont recommend ,?
1073880,Extremely rude on the phone  Initially refused to give me a general estimate  then hung up on me when I said it was a little higher than I expected! Not a nice way to treat pontential clients  Also  he quoted $1 500 00 to reupholster my car seats ,?
1074348,Extremely slow service   interior wasnt particularly clean   soft drinks werent calibrated properly  Wont be back ,?
1074495,Extremely terrible service  the owner is a big scam artist  Prior to us renting a car  Ovais the owner gave us only one choice of vehicle  and told us it was a new car  the very next day i find out i have a flat tire but due to tire wearing and a bubble on the inside of the wheel  not only did he refuse to help the situation he made us purchase  him a brand new tire for $200 and told us we would not get our money back until we replaced the whole wheel  Basically he gave us a car that was already damaged with worn tires ( worn from inside with curb bubble) and decided to let us find out for ourselves the hard way  After this incident we tried to file a complaint to the company or customer service department  and all phone numbers linked back to the Owners cell phone  so there wasnt anywhere to go to for help or support  i would definitely not recommend this place to anyone  and i sure hope no one gets scammed the way i did,?
1075203,Fing greatest ribs!  Already planning my next trip just for the ribs and strippers ,?
1075692,FANTASTIC service!  We will be using them again for sure   In short:Ordering was simple from far away (TX)Customer service was very responsive when I needed to change my delivery dateThe flowers were gorgeous and fragrantPrice was rightLocal businessTry them  you wont be disappointed ,?
1077390,FOOD Fried Calamari: tender  flavorful  and wellcooked  5/5 Stone Crab: simple  sweet and meaty  5/5 Seafood Pasta: Alaskan King Crab  lobster  shrimp over pesto fettuccine  asparagus  spinach  and cherry tomatoes  The meat was great but the overall dish lacked flavor  The portion size may be small for others but it was perfect for me  4/5SERVICE: Amazing service  We were greeted and seated almost immediately  Our waiters were great  Food came out in a timely manner despite our party of 20  5/5FINAL THOUGHTS: I would definitely come back  Great service and food ,?
1077602,FOOD POISONING!!!!!! Dont eat here  Eat at your own risk  I dont normally eat it but I for sure will never eat their food again  McDonalds is so terrible for you anyways ,?
1077699,FOOD:Pro: The only thing I liked here is their Pork BBQ which they cook outside/in front of the restaurant  and the live band on Saturday night (Singers are really great)  Con: Dont bother trying out the buffet  its MEH  Sisig here is good  not great but I will give it a shot next time still AMBIANCE:Pro: They have an acoustic live band on some nights like Saturday nights  The male singers Ive heard so far are really good  They give a good vibe on this restaurant SERVICE:Con: The staff looks like they are mad at you every time you call them to order or to ask something  They are not smiling and looks like they have a lot of tension  Pro: The owner is very friendly though  he will usually ask you hows the food  which is great ,?
1078023,FOUND A HUGE LARVAE IN MY STEAK AND EGGS BREAKFAST  NEVER AGAIN  Have been coming here for breakfast the past 3 years while on vacation  But this past experience will make me never ever come back ,?
1078588,FUN FUN FUN FUN FUN!Brought back so many memories of my childhood  Im 51 now and had a great time playing pinball again So much fun ,?
1079095,FYI; They do a turn down service in the afternoon  But they dont tell you about it  So just beware not to leave anything personal out while you run to the restaurant for appetizers before dinner  They will come in your room and go through the bedroom and bathroom   so make sure you dont leave personal things laying around   Not to mention this is the water glass the waiter kept pouring water in at the Jade Bar  We finally had to ask him to take it away because it was unappetizing   THIS is a five star resort?!,?
1079368,Fabulous Chinese and Thai food here   We used to regularly drive to Huntersville for really good sitdown Chinese  but dont have to any more   The prices are very reasonable  too   Their panfried potstickers are an excellent appetizer (the slightly sweet soy ginger dipping sauce is amazing)   We have tried and loved several meals including the sesame chicken  spicy thai red curry chicken  singapore rice noodles  sacha chicken  and pad thai   Im not a sushi fan  but folks Ive eaten there with have said it was delicious as well   Weve never been disappointed   Service has always been topnotch  and all the wait staff are great with kids (we have 3)   Were getting close to regulars here!,?
1080445,Fabulous happy hour  super impressive starters and cocktail menu! Great atmosphere and service ,?
1080458,Fabulous honeyhot wings  get them grilled; its worth the extra money! My Philly  cheesesteak sandwich was very good and everything was well seasoned  Only reason I didnt give them a five was because theyre slow  but was worth the wait and staff is very friendly!,?
1080498,Fabulous job!  Ive never had my house cleaned by someone else before and was extremely pleased   They arrived in the expected window and worked from the moment they entered the house   Everything was left spotless!,?
1080676,Fabulous night with the hubs  Food was exceptionally well prepared amazing blend of flavors perfectly complementing each other  Left totally satisfied  full but not uncomfortably so  Our server Brian was first rate and incredibly professional steering us to some amazing choices  I will be back as often as possible!,?

1081793,Face it  youre going to the buffet because you want to get revenge on the Aria casino   How many hours did you spend in the casino last night?  If youre like me  18 straight   Your sole mission is to eat one or two thousands of dollars of snow crab legs and shrimp   Reality check  it aint happening   The food here was decent  but nothing special   I did eat as many crab legs as possible  but after the 3rd or 4th plate  it just tasted bland   I do love how they split them in half for you The other food there  such as the flank steak  the portuguese sausage  spaghetti  french fries  some asian stuff  mashed potatoes  and sushi were just average   They didnt even have soft serve    Cmon man   Soft serve   Who the F wants lime flavored gelato?The Aria is on my black list for at least 2 years   Go somewhere else for a buffet ,?
1082631,Fair trade coffee and in house roast beans  They have a wonderful arraignment of drinks  All of their lattes are great  They make their own pistachio milk for one of their lattes which is one of my top drinks from here  My toddler loves their sourdough bread grill cheese  The owner and employees are very friendly and helpful  Its a great place to play games for all ages  They have so much selection  its hard to figure out which game to play first  Games are free to play as long as you order a drink  We have quality family game nights here  its a great place for familys and groups of any size ,?
1082792,Fairly busy place in the heart of Mississauga at Sqaure One  Lots of movies and showtimes any say of the week ,?
1082923,Fairly generic hotel lobby bar at the Hilton Garden Inn  Not much to write home about  except for their great happy hour special (weekdays 4 to 7 pm)  which featured half off speciality cocktails  There were quite a few options  I opted for the classic Manhattan  which wasnt the best Manhattan Ive ever tasted  but for about $7 CAD (~$5 USD)  it definitely was the best value!Because the bar itself is so small  the bartender is very quick and attentive  Definitely worth a visit!,?
1083278,Fairly typical Chinese food with a Sushi menu and nice restaurant seating area   I wasnt as wowd as I was hoping after reading all the rave reviews here on Yelp  but it is a pretty decent offering I tried the egg drop soup  which was a good value  the pork dumplings  which were meh  I think the sauce was overly sweet  the kung pao chicken  which was pretty good  and the chicken lo mein noodles  which were meh (but arent all lo mein noodles pretty meh?) Overall I would come back and get some take out because it does lie somewhere in between your PFChangs and your strip mall cheap Chinese take out place   However  I dont believe its that great of a value offering   The prices are a bit high for cheap Chinese  and the quality is only just a bit higher   Doesnt feel like youre getting a great deal ,?
1083442,Fajardos is what was once know as Lilys Cafe   I have been going there since the mid 80s and still love this place  When Zip the chef and owner died in 2006 we not only lost a great friend but we lost our favorite restaurant   When the Fajardo family reopened the place it was really like a dream come true  I still really miss Zip but I know he would be happy that the restaurant lives on without him  The food is still the same and wonderful  The Salsa is great and I find myself eating a few bowls of it before i ever even get my food   My suggestions are the green chile soup and the special burrito (once called the Zip burrito   I do admit though i have never had a dish there i didnt like   This place is one that you must check out ,?
1084376,Family friendly place  My 2 year old daughter liked bread and ate 3 pieces  Nice atmosphere and great food  We ordered beef n reef salad  chicken pesto pizza and bolognese pasta (with home made pasta)  all delicious Plus you see through the counter how your food being cooked! All transparent ,?
1084415,Family friendly  The wait at Dottys was 40 min  We popped into Ians  grabbed a quick and tasty slice and the kids got to go swimming sooner!Ians have a nice variety of pizzas and salads to suit everybodys tastes The slices are big  I got one and rest of my Fam got 2 slices  The staff are exuberant  informative and helpful ,?
1084948,Family owned restaurant thats been around since the beginning of time   Their location looks very nostalgic  with everything looking like it hasnt changed since they first opened   (except the rack of 80s music cds)    Theyre known for their Wilenksy special   Its a beef bologna sandwich with mustard and its pressed flat like a panini   Good sandwich  but nothing i would crave ,?
1085221,Family run  Great service  Great atmosphere Clean  fun and a great time Traditional wood lanes  well maintained alley Great bar  bartenders and TouchTunes,?
1085340,Family was hungry and sushi hiro and zipang were closed for lunch so we decided to go to shikiji again  Thankfully  the devils spawn hostess named Jenna wasnt working  We ordered two bentos  shio ramen and a sushi roll  Almost everything in the bentos was inedible  Tempura was fried in old oil  chicken and beef were very very tough to chew and was frankly inedible (I would place Edo Japan as a 10/10 compared to the meal we had) nigiri was sliced poorly  salad was meh  Need I say more? The sushi rolls had frozen fish inside the roll  Nice touch  I didnt taste the ramen but my family said the noodles were overcooked and the broth tasted very different from before  Highly suspect either the management or kitchen staff have changed ,?
1085487,Famoso if youre reading this  please please please make the soups warmer  it was room temperature at best  Its such a good soup  it deserves the attention  this isnt the first time :(,?
1086582,Fantastic Chinese food  very entertaining vocal performances by the opening act  plus the owner (the star of the show)! Service was some of the best Ive experienced  anywhere  Ill be returning!,?
1086957,Fantastic Looking Shop!  Lots of Jewelry!  Two very friendly and helpful looking ladies working here today   Great place to buy that lady in your life a gift!  Guys  there is nothing else in here for you!  Ladies who have not been here  this is a store you will probably love ,?
1087888,Fantastic barbecue  brussles sprouts that will change the minds of non sprout eaters   this place is just as good as it gets    do not miss the fried chicken  which is easily the best in the Burgh The bar upstairs  Harvard and Highland  is wonderful and has taken to hosting comedy shows   great times to be had ,?
1087993,Fantastic beers can be found here  This location is nestled right in the flats and gives you a nice view of the city and the Cuyahoga River  The outdoor bar is massive  Ive had most of their beers and every one is good  Im a fan of their bloodhound orange IPA! Definitely worth a visit if you are in the area!,?
1088021,Fantastic boba tea here!  And get it with soymilk and its vegan!My personal favorites are taro coconut w/soymilk  mango coconut w/soymilk  and pineapple coconut w/soymilk!Staff is friendly!  Cheers!,?
1088535,Fantastic chicken strips!  The Texas toast is good   Fries could be crispier     The Canes sauce is GREAT   This place is BUSY!  And the decor is pretty cool  We ate in and my god daughter was excited because cute boys were sitting behind us    LOL!,?
1088547,Fantastic chiropractic  Staff is very nice  place is clean and comfortable  Practice is family owned and ran and both chiros that I have seen (husband and wife) are really good   Would definitely recommend ,?
1088620,Fantastic coffee and a beautiful cafe  I met here for a work meeting that went on for 3 hours and the entire time this place was packed  which speaks to the level of fanfare it has  Despite the number of people it remained fairly quiet so would probably make a decent work space  I definitely recommend checking this place out  Its a got a pretty soothing vibe to it and you cant beat their coffee ,?
1088762,Fantastic company!  I called and Dave was quick to help us out    giving me a couple of service time options   He was prompt in his arrival  very professional  friendly and informative   My fiveyearold had closed the garage door into the tailgate of my van  causing the wiring to come off of the track on both sides   Dave was able to run the wiring back on   good as new The pricing was very competitive    we would highly recommend him!!,?
1089705,Fantastic experience!  The facility is so peaceful and serene!  Michael gave my massage and it was so relaxing  I will definitely be back!,?

1090740,Fantastic food at a rockbottom price   And the plates are HUGE!  You will not be disappointed!,?
1091039,Fantastic food! I enjoyed the Enchanted platter that had three different samples of other main courses on it  As someone that only likes a little bit of spice  this was PERFECT! It also comes with rice and beans and a sopapilla! Have to ask for some honey for the sopapilla    SO GOOD! The outside patio is a really nice place to sit and enjoy the company of others  We will return!,?
1091084,Fantastic food! Some of the best raw/vegan food Ive had anywhere  and Ive been to most of the big name restaurants in NYC  SF and Chicago I had the 15 course raw tasting  the tacos and the stew  All were phenomenal  Highly recommended ,?
1091244,Fantastic food  atmosphere  and service   Little busy on a Sunday morning  but they get you seated quickly  The food has the home cooked  country taste  Going to make this a regular spot!,?
1091321,Fantastic food  fantastic beverages (bottomless mimosa )  but most of all  our waiter Sean was AWESOME! Breakfast was phenomenal and just the little things made our meal so great and his warming and courteous manner is an asset to Hexx! Keep it up!,?
1092001,Fantastic fresh New Mexico food   Try the adovado relleno   The homemade salsas are excellent ,?
1092074,Fantastic from start to finish   Meals  service  ambience all top notch   Spent almost 3 hours there  a perfect special occasion restaurant ,?
1092432,Fantastic hotel   Nice & clean   Lots of dining & entertainment options on site   The comped drinks when gambling are pretty strong pours too Heres a tip: dont go on the weekend Madonnas playing   Maybe that will keep you from spending $550 for two nights for a tower room   During the week  its $89 ,?
1092615,Fantastic job!!!!!!! We sold our house and I needed someone to come out on sat to clean 3 rooms and hallway and that was challenging to find someone last minute on a weekend So I went on Yelp and started doing my research and found a lot of great reviews on this company so I had to call and see if they would be able to make the appointment so quickly and sure enough they got me a next day appointment Excellent customer service they even sent me a text messages notification on the ETA and the name of the person who was going to do the service Diego Our carpet has a lot of little marks from kids and pets and I was almost positive those stains were never going to come out  but I was wrong Diego did such a great job it looks like a brand new carpet and I cant tell you how happy I am I took a chance and trusted the yelpers with their reviews I too HIGHLY RECOMMEND this company to clean your carpets as well ,?
1092660,Fantastic khao soi  (I usually get chicken or beef) and nua gra (garlic beef)   If you sit by the bar you can make friends with the mixologist who makes excellent cocktails ,?
1092690,Fantastic light roast  Tons of fruit and smoky nuances  Probably the best pour over in the city  Baristas super fun and helpful  Also had a brilliant quad cortado that I can honestly say is the best Ive ever had in Canada  Mostly because its the only one Ive had in Canada ;)  Love this spot  Cant wait to go back ,?
1092851,Fantastic little shop! I highly recommend them! I tell everyone I can about them  They did our wedding flowers and I could not of asked for a better flower shop  They were very good to my husband and I giving us their full attention and all the time we needed  They were very kind and understanding  They helped us pick our flowers and created just what I dreamed my flowers would be like on our special day  This is the only flower shop we do business with now  Love  love  love them!!!!! I wish I could give way more than 5 stars ,?
1093249,Fantastic meal   I know its burgers but for a great comfort meal  this was delicious   Fries were so hot  I had to let them cool before eating   My wife had a shake and she said she was coming back again  $31 for two burgers  fries and a shake   But for Vegas  not bad   Well be back before this trip is over ,?
1093340,Fantastic milk tea and coffee     havent tried anything else there though They could use a renovation but with all the business they draw its really not nessesary ,?
1093507,Fantastic new upscale location   The owners turned a great seafood kitchen into a first class tapas spot   The kitchen wall was removed with a chefs table and bar facing very high end gourmet kitchen  wonderful booths and bar area  glass fireplace  small glass enclosed wine room with an excellent selection  great looking patio opening Oct 6th  and a private room seating 24   Service was very attentive augmented by the owners personally welcoming and helping to serve Wonderful food  every one of the four tapas was super tasty and prepared just right   Spanish stuffed dates  Spanish honey shrimp  French scallops under glass and Russian dumpling   Four were perfect for two people  All topped off by an excellent Malbec  Half the price of the steak house next door and much better food!Will definitely be back soon to try the entrees and the paellas!! And for lunch!Highly recommend ,?
1093628,Fantastic oysters! Incredible service! Reasonable prices  Great mushroom soup  My only complaint was that my steak was lacking flavor ,?
1094130,Fantastic place nestled in the hallway of the Golden Nugget   This place used to be a place called Zacks or Zax   cant remember that far back   Good service   Nice seating   Great Frank Dean and the rest music   You know   The music that Mom and Dad used throw on the Motorola 33 and 1/3 turntable console model and then after a couple martinis were all over each other?  Yeah that good ol The Best is Yet to Come Sinatra singing while they serve an outstanding New York   Too bad it isnt Zacks   They had the best Chimmy Churry Sauce I have EVER had ,?
1094387,Fantastic place! Great Happy Hour menu  The Ahi Poke  California and Spicy Tuna rolls were all exceptional!,?
1094421,Fantastic place! Met some friends who live in LV while we were in town for a trip and they recommended this place  just off the main strip  Drinks are handmade craft cocktails hat are phenomenal  The drink menu is organized by era (Prohibition  Rat Pack  etc ) with short descriptions and the origin/history of each drink  I had the Remember the Maine  Vieux Carre  and one more that escapes me  All were fantastic  Then  the food! We ordered during happy hour which means all the steaks are half off  Had a great Flat Iron steak with the Steak Frites  Great dinner and drinks spot!,?
1094741,Fantastic product and very friendly  knowledgeable employees  They had excellent suggestions for pairings and gave tips on how to use the products ,?
1094994,Fantastic restaurant  Ambience  food and service  As the name suggests it looks like a beautiful garden! Not too count the delicious and unique flower pot chocolate cake desert  Truly a work of art  Will be back over and over!,?
1095149,Fantastic sandwiches!! Each one is unique with interesting combinations  They also has an assortment of local beers to pair with your sandwich  We will definitely be back again!!,?
1095470,Fantastic service and great food! Had the trash can nachos and shared the Mac and cheese burger with my hubby  Both were super tasty and the portions were HUGE  Wait staff was extremely attentive and was wowed by Jason  I believe  the GM  Great dining experience and ambiance!,?
1095786,Fantastic service! Everyone talks about how difficult mattress buying is  but we had just the opposite experience  Plenty of time to figure out what we wanted and got an awesome deal!,?
1096074,Fantastic service  great prices  fresh sushi  and the presentation of the dishes makes you well aware the chef takes pride in their work  I hope they keep this up ,?
1096205,Fantastic service  Fast and friendly waitress  People watching from patio was the best  View was amazing  Very comfortable  Drink was delicious and prices were fair,?
1096397,Fantastic show with a little bit of everything  acrobatics  thrilling drops and tricks  intricate choreography  compelling story   Lights  water  fire   Every seat in this circular arena is a great one  The first 2 rows may result in a little bit of splash  but you shouldnt be soaked   One of the best shows on the strip! Enjoy the dream!,?
1098433,Fantastic! We came specifically for Lou  followed him from Vegas! Absolutely delicious! He made a special order for me of my favorite Vegas roll into a bowl  perfection! Ill be back!,?
1098764,Fantastic!!!!! Go here if you want a full body rub down for $22  Ive been back every Monday for the last 3 months ,?
1099116,Fantastic  Coming from Los Angeles I have to say this market is amazing  I only wish we had local supermarkets like this  Well stocked  clean  great atmosphere  Selection was great as well  Ill be coming here more often ,?
1099204,Fantastic   The steak burger is one of the best sandwiches Ive ever eaten in my life   Perfectly cooked and perfectly seasoned   The pork shoulder sandwich could use a bit more sauce on it  but luckily  they provide you with four delicious sauces to add!  This is hands down the best restaurant Ive eaten at in the city so far (3 years)!,?
1100013,Farhat is my quick and cheap meal if Im heading out of Toronto  Two for one falafels are always my choice and I just ask for the works (although prepare for you and your car to reek of garlic the next day)  Always friendly staff  but the whole process takes longer than making a sub  so be prepared to wait a while if you arent first in line Once I ordered four falafels and I think the worker misunderstood me and only made two  When I clarified  they didnt even break a sweat (despite the lineup) and seamlessly worked it in to their workflow with the other customers  You dont get that kind of service without a sneer at other fast food chains  Top marks to the employees ,?
1101031,Fast and friendly considering it was Memorial Day  Food was absolutely awesome  No complaints,?
1102838,Fast response  arrived on time  job (3 rekeys and opening a door for which I had no key and making a new key for it) professionally done  price very reasonable  level of service very high  Thanks Levi! Maggie,?
1103432,Fast service  cute place in the neighborhood  Tom yum Soup was delicious and same with the main dish I had One thing I would not recommend as it was way too oily and soaking in oil  was the deep fried water spinach  the menu doesnt say that it will be deep fried  but if you are looking healthy vegetables  and order that you will be in for a shock ,?
1103464,Fast service  food was good  especially the moist brisket  They dont have traditional sides like Mac n cheese or corn bread  The serving trays are about as cumbersome as carrying around an oil derrick  Oh and there werent any napkins readily available ,?
1103753,Fast service  Casa Don Juan has your run of the mill texmex with other native Mexican/South American dishes on the menu  The pricing is fair and the margaritas are exceptional(I believe they carry Cazadores  one of my favorite tequila brands  The serving are usually huge and I can never finish my plate  Its a good place for a first date and other casual social occaisions ,?
1104326,Fast  easy and delicious! Great selection of toppings  different sauces  gluten free crust and vegan cheese  This place has a lot to offer and is ridiculously tasty!,?
1104623,Fast  friendly and good! Went for lunch and had the chicken teriyaki lunch bowl  It did not disappoint  Customer service was equally great! Inside seating is small  however  there is an outdoor patio that is covered and nice to sit out enjoying people watching  I would recommend this for lunch  And I will definitely be back soon ,?
1104845,Fast  friendly   efficient   and clean! I love Panera Bread and these guys were on top of it! The food was good and the new kiosks are incredibly convient for browsing for folks that are indecisive (like myself) ,?
1105206,Fast  quick  exactly what you would expect from a breakfast restaurant  Passing through Las Vegas and we noticed this place had 4 5 stars   The staff is friendly & accommodating  Thank you Yelp!,?
1105363,Fast  Delicious  Cheap  Ordered one steak and one spicy pork  The pork was my favorite of the two  Wish I would have went sooner ,?
1106078,Fate mixes together two of the finer things in life  Pizza and beer and they do a hell of a job at it  The fennel sausage pizza was great  love the goat cheese  The pesto pizza also a strong choice  The beers are all very good  Love the sours when they are available ,?
1106180,Fathers day  Fathers choice! I picked Xafe Berlin because it is something that you wont get pretty much any where else in town  Schnitzel it was and I went gypsystyle  while me wife went Rahm  allaround delicious choices  with plenty of food and helpful staff  It was very busy  and they seemed a bit understaffed but still did a great job getting us and our wheelchairdependent little one to a table  There was some confusion between the first person who took our drinks order and the server  because they never did bring out the wine my wife ordered or the water I ordered (they did get her water and my German beer  though!)    so a point off  but overall was a great choice  Weve been here a handful of times and will most certainly be back!,?
1106709,Favorite Mediterranean restaurant with great service  Some of the best hummus and falafel in Arizona ,?
1107099,Favorite breakfast/brunch place when in Vegas  But  you need a mode of transportation because its not on the strip TIP: If you check in through Yelp  you get free of the delicious  moist Banana Nut Muffin  (Do it! Its worth it )Be prepared to wait in line before seated  ALWAYS busy  So dont come here starving because youll end up hAngry  FOOD: I love everything I ordered from this place  Oh  if you eat like a bird  share The food with someone because they serve big portions  (My son and BF always finish their plates though )They also have rice plates  3 choices  Hawaiin style  YUM!DRINkS: Mimosa is not unlimited  But soft drinks and coffee are  Also if you order juice  theyd give you a carafe PRICE: decent price  They accept Amex  Pay at the cashier once you receive your receipt  RESTROOM: small but clean  SPACE: big space  good for groups  They also have outdoor seating SERVICE: fast (once seated) and efficient friendly staff ,?
1107326,Favorite dishes: escargot  seafood crepe  mussels  salmon salad  and crab cakes I always come here whenever I go to Vegas just to eat their escargots  Best escargot!!!,?
1108311,Favorite place!  Ambiance is wonderful  service is excellent   Food is consistently top notch  We  Come  frequently with friends and business clients   never disappoints   ,?
1108691,Favorite sushi place by far! I enjoy this location and the one in North Las Vegas  Their garlic edamame is definitely my favorite and would recommend it to everyone  I like going to the one in North Las Vegas because the location is more convenient but also because it has all you can eat ,?
1108875,Favorite wings in town! Not to mention the service is absolutely amazing!!!!!! Been coming to eat here for 3 years now,?
1109396,Feb 2016  Work lunchMagic Noodle Signature Beef Soup Noodle Sm $7 99Standard Noodle was good  Ok due to rest of dish being unimpressive  especially meat http://www magicnoodle ca/magicnoodle html#anchoru11424,?
1109586,FeefiPHOfumI smell the broth of Vietnam Topped with basil  lime  bean spouts and peppers My oh my  Pho couldnt possibly get any better ,?
1109742,Feel like you want to hang out at a yacht club but have no yacht? Well then this is the place for you  Really great interior including bar area  Lobster rolls to die for! Lobster pasta good too although not quite as good as the lobster rolls Its pricey but the food was great and definitely worth more then one visit  They also do happy hour on Saturdays  Enjoy the beachy vibe!,?
1110166,Feels like home! Great food  Great drinks & Great people!!This place has become one of my favorite sports bars in town  Its close to the city  but not downtown  They have a ton of brand new tvs on every inch of the walls and are able to change the sound for the area you are seated in  I am a bit bias  as it houses the Michigan State Alumni Club of Charlotte  Go Green! They even have some Michigan brews on tap too  This place is also the official game watch for Clemson and Miami  Best Tip about this place: there is a back entrance on the lower side to the downstairs bar  plus it has a HUGE projector screen downstairs too!!,?
1111043,Felt the good was fair as well as the service however the prices were too high for bar type food   They ran out of the orange blossom beer which was disappointing ,?
1111282,Fernando the manager has zero communication skills  Offered nothing to me after waiting for 30 min and no one working on my trucks detailing  I had to go and ask why 4 employees stood around and not work on my truck  horrible work  customer service and communication   never going here again ,?
1111569,Few reviewers liked this place better than Bamiyans  I would like to differ  I would agree that they have huge portions  Their menu is good too  you may taste two different types of kebabs in the meal but I believe that the kebabs at Bamiyan taste much better The food here is amazing value as I was only able to finish half of it  I took a parcel to eat it next day  but didnt feel like it as the taste was okay at best  It was a little too salty for me ,?
1113348,Finally Japanese cheesecake close by !! super delicious and fairly priced  Just make sure you call if youre going close to close because they sell out !,?
1113634,Finally a boba place right next to my house! Ive been here about 5 times now and tried most of their drinks  My favs are the rose garden and milk tea  Thai tea  coffee  and oreo were also great  The boba is prefect and they have a bunch of options to make your own drink unlike other places in town  The taro and crystal jade arent really good IMO  They should make the taro into a slush I would give 5 stars  but everytime Ive gotten a milk tea they pack on the ice  Each time they pulled a starbucks and filled my cup almost 3/4 with ice so 5 sips and Im practically done with the drink  They are not officially open  but when they are I hope they know what an appropriate amount of ice is  Customer service is really good and staff is friendly especially the owner  They bring you the boba to your seat and I think they plan on having snow cream  They tell you they can fix your drink if you dont like it  but Im always too shy to say anything  I wish they had stamp cards!,?
1115167,Finally brought my wonderful wife here    We ate bread and pesto  more bread and pesto and a little more bread and pesto  We also had Chicken Princesseola or something like that    Loved it  Except the risotto was mushy    bad mushyWe also had a pasta with sausage and stuff  It was OK  just a Tad boring  The service was good  the price was fine  we too used a coupon and they had no issues honoring it  The math was correct too  LOL,?
1115339,Finally checked out a White Castle and sadly   it tasted just like the microwave kind  It was a bit of a long wait  at least 40 people in front of us  and only one cashier  Sliders were about $2 a pop  and theres a good amount of seating  Since we only ordered 2 sliders ours came out quick  It was tasty  but no need to go back ,?
1115635,Finally decided to try this place out since its next to my coffee place   I though it was pretty good and the service was quick and friendly   They were pretty busy and the place was clean too  I got the Jersey Shores Favorite and thought it was pretty good and I liked that they sliced the meat right then and there     no opening the package in front of you like another sandwich place!  I will definitely be back!,?
1116358,Finally getting around to reviewing Brunos    I first found this place in 2002  I was rebuilding the W 44th street bridge and we started checking out every place in the neighborhood  So  all dirty with jackhammer dust me and the rest of my construction crew(quite a motley crew I may add) stumbled into Brunos on our 1/2 hour lunch      We were a little taken aback to see people in suits  including a Cleveland councilman  in this tiny place on a weekday for lunch  We immediately felt out of place  underdressed  and too dirty to eat here     Well  until the staff  the councilman  and Bruno all thanked us for the job we were doing in the neighborhood  They were very gracious  sat us quickly  got us our check early since they knew we had limited time     I have taken my wife  as well as some of our friends here  NOT once has Brunos ever disappointed me  my wife  or our friends  This place is by far my favorite Italian restaurant in the city of Cleveland!!,?
1116441,Finally got  around to grabbing lunch at Negroni  After a brief chat with the waitress about my cardigan (a showstopping piece of attire for sure)  I jumped into a potato and leek soup and a mushroom risotto  I was nonplussed by the risotto  It was starchy and didnt really have a compelling flavour  Was I expecting too much? Perhaps  The soup on the other hand  was a knock out  So  so good  Service  as usual  is top drawer ,?
1118243,Finally had the chance to pop in  Grabbed the street tacos so I could sample all of the meats  Green Chile pork has a serious kick  The regular chicken was delicious as was the red  Decor is cool  music a bit loud it was hard to hear the staff when I was ordering (thus why I am not sure of the official names of meats) for a plate of 5 street tacos the price was great for our area  the rest of the menu seemed a bit high priced IMO when compared to other Mexican joints around here for similar items ,?
1119359,Finally open in Paradise Las Vegas  This is probably the biggest 99 Ranch Market I ever been to  They have a large selection of everything specially Asian goods  Nice indoor restaurant with sitting area  The meat and veggies section is huge ,?
1119597,Finally someone put a bar in this area of Summerlin! This is a great place for food  drinks and sports viewing  They have video poker at the bar  but only half of the bar has machines  So you can go in here and not have to sit in front of a poker machine if you dont want to  The food here is great! I love the animal style tater tots  a knock off of the animal style fries from In NOut  The staff is extremely friendly  and are really great at remembering your name if you frequent here  If you sign up for their players club  they do offer a decent amount of free play as well ,?
1119807,Finally stopped there to try the sliders  Wont be going back  Food was good but overpriced  I ordered 2 sliders for my son and I to taste  and thats just what it was    a taste  That taste cost me $7 03 with the tax  I told my son I couldnt believe I just spent $3 on one slider and $3 50 on the other when I never spend that much on a large burger anywhere else   He added Six Mcdoubles would have cost less  Their prices should be get two sliders for that price  They would get a heck of a lot more business because the sliders are tasty  I will stick with In and Out ,?
1121270,Finally! A decent bagel that reminds me of home!!! NY :)Such good breakfast and deli options  well priced and quick even with a crowd waiting   I also had wonderfully sweet service amid the busy Sunday morning rush   Cant wait to go back!,?
1122225,Finally  a decent pizza place out where I live in the northwest  Its true  until now all the pizza places out here are awful  North End is different  They make pizza with thin crust  good sauce thats not spicy and no tomato chunks  and its a joy to eat  Theyre obviously from Boston since there is Boston references all over the walls  Theyre in a kind of out of the way new strip mall off Durango  Im telling everyone I know to go there  Prices are about average with other pizza places  Try it  youll like it!,?
1122726,Finally  good fish and chips for the Newmarket area! The service is so friendly :) the kind of friendly you rarely see anymore  and the foods all made from scratch (you can really taste it)  The portions are also massive  and taste super fresh  Outstanding experience! I will be back for sure! Also  it has a great vibe and unique food  awesome place for date night!,?
1122770,Finally  my dreams came true    made it to the famous Cracker Barrel but was saddened & not impressed  The food was good but not great like I imagined in my dreams  I would return to give it another try because Im about second chances  They dis have a lot of cool things to buys in the store! OXOX,?
1123767,Finding competent barbers capable of modern straight razor fades today can be a challenge  But behold Bethel Barber Shop  where they seem to recruit only the best The shop is clean inside and well kept on the outside  with its own dedicated parking as well  Wait times were minimal if any at all  I was seated immediately upon entering   **Update  wait is on average 2030 mins  Be courteous and arrive at least 1 hour prior to close of business**At the end of the haircut they put a warm towel on your head that is a nice touch  The price is more than what Im used to paying per haircut but Id rather pay more and know I will get a clean cut  than risk walking around with a jacked up haircut just to save a few bucks  Id recommend this place to anyone local!,?
1123967,Finding the right loan company is the second most important thing to finding the right house  Its important the have a loan officer who can emphasize with you  Thats one of the best quality I experienced with Nova  Dennis Schultz was excellent  He worked closely with us and kept us informed on the progress of our home loan  He was available any time of the day to answer questions  Im so glad my realtor recommend them  They were my first and only choiceId recommend them to anyone who is planning on buying or refinancing,?
1124125,Fine Ill claim the FTR  even after waiting for someone else to claim it Ive been to Dula Gym about 10 times  Its right there in Downtown Las Vegas   Honestly  they arent that bad of a place to go to its not upscale and is small but has the amenities that really matter  Its a 3 5 star rating They have smaller fitness room with a few heavy duty weight and cardio machines  and free weights  They have showers and lockers and is air conditioned   If youre looking to just play hoops or volleyball they have special hours for that  Last I heard its only $2 to use the basketball courts during open gym for a year  You can also request the courts if you need them for a team practice  example for Corporate Challenge Im sure theres more amenities as it a senior/community center   The staff here are nice  friendly  and very helpful   The facilities are well maintained ,?
1124186,Fine dining at its best   I just got back from an excellent meal from Via Brasil in summerlin   I found myself comparing this place to Texas de Brazil in Town Square all night long   And here is my verdict    The salad bar at Texas de Brazil is better  fresher  tastier   However  the meats at Via Brasil are superior to Texas   The meats are not as fatty and just taste better   My favorites were the prime rib  top sirloin and beef ribs   Both atmospheres are very nice  clean  and beautiful   Another observation I made was that the staff at Via (the waiters  the guys that cut the meat  the managers  hostess) were much more professional  courteous and all around nicer than the staff at Texas   I really liked this place   I went on a groupon so I ended up paying $50 for 2 people ,?
1124686,Fioris lives up to the hype that it has around Pittsburgh! Pizza is classic and delicious and I love that they offer cold cheese on the side which is a personal favorite for me! One negative  dont get extra cheese on your pizza if your getting it to go  By the time you get home its very messy  but that being said its still delicious!,?
1124844,FireBirds is a great restaurant for families and romantic dates  The Delmonico Ribeye is wondeful  Its tender and seasoned perfectly  Its definitely elevated American style food add its one of our goto places for a satisfying meal ,?
1125430,First (and possibly last) time I tried Tastybunz was at the first Food Truck Fest    We got 3 bunzBacon Bird  Mac N Cheese  and dont remember the other one   Also got their Tocino Slider  and the saving grace was the fried egg on top    Like everyone says  Too much bunz  not enough tasty Overall  not a good first visit   its gonna take alot to get me to pay another visit(I still havent given Hanshiktaco another visit either)   Theyll probably be at the next Food Truck Fest  but I think Ill give other vendors a shot   ALOHA!!!,?
1126552,First Ill start by saying that Steve and his crew are completely AWESOME!We needed a 300 pound item moved up a flight of stairs and the team at ARMS gave us a very reasonable quote that was cheaper than many other movers in the Valley area These guys are extremely professional  friendly  easy going  and FAST   They showed up a few minutes early and got straight to work   They put down padding to ensure the floor wouldnt get any scrapes etc  and treated our stuff very respectfully Everything from booking the appointment to getting our belongings moved was an excellent experience   ARMS has definitely secured us as a future customer for all our moving needs The reviews speak for themselves  these guys are the real deal   HIGHLY recommend!Thank you ARMS!,?
1126579,First Im just going to cut and paste anothers comment  We had a good  reasonably priced meal served by a courteous and attentive waiter  Food was served promptly and hot and was very good  That sums it up  Next  get their players card  When I got mine last year you got two entry for the price of one and the price of the prime rib dinner drops 2 bucks ( Its a good dinner  Place is not super fancy  but the food is reasonable and plentiful  I bet I have eaten her the most when I hit Vegas ,?
1126742,First NYC  now Vegas   Guy is really on a roll   And what they both have in common  they serve the best food from his best workers there   Christina and Laura  who works at the bar  are such sweethearts   They served me well and served with their best smiles   And I told them bout me being a loyal customer in NYC   They loved that so much  the manager Harvey was nice to take a pic of me eating and post it on Instagram   The best meal I had was their Mac & Cheese Bacon Burger   Once again  the S S  Flavortown has set sail   Thanks for everything and wish you Guy and everyone the best and keep on Doing Work ,?
1127363,First and foremost Brett little blond you might might be cute but your service was very ugly  The fact that we had to ask for silverware and napkins goes to show you the attention they pay you  I will continue to wine and dine until I find the right place   Oh well,?
1127383,First and foremost I have to give GG props for being able to make the seamless transition from food truck to actual brick and mortar establishment  this is no easy feat!  So congrats   I have been to the Beach location on many an occasion and have never been disappointed   The burritos are a carnivores dream  if you get meat of course   you can literally eat half for dinner and take the 2nd half for lunch the next day  THAT is how filling they are   I stick to my tried  tested and true half chicken tinga  half chorizo burrito combination   All burritos come with rice  black beans  pico de gallo  and shredded cheese  add an extra 1$ and you get satisfyingly creamy guac   The Argentinian Empanadas with Chimichurri sauce are also a solid choice  but if you want to be gutbusting full opt for a large burrito  it will never disappoint! The Beach location is super quiet to eat in  and in nice weather you can grab your food to go and enjoy close by Kew Gardens ,?
1128096,First and last time I stayed here   I booked a last minute trip on a busy weekend which I understand the hiccups that can go along with that (price increases  lots of people  etc)  but it was horrible   It took over an hour to check in they only had two people working   When we finally got our room it was completely disappointing     The room was completely outdated and crowded   The furniture was old and dingy looking the in room coffee maker didnt work  the A/C unit was mickey moused to cool both the bedroom and living areas   When we called for extra towels and the WiFi password we were pick on hold several times   This place needs a major makeover of the facility and the staff ,?
1128864,First came here with my girlfriend  immediately after arriving in Toronto for vacation  Service was a little slow  but the restaurant was packed  so I can forgive that  The meals were were quite good  with no complaints on this matter  The atmosphere was fine  certainly better than the gaudy Asianthemed establishments I have witnessed elsewhere  Not being from Canada  we were not familiar with the payment machines in use  and the staff were friendly in helping us navigate the system On our second visit  because we were hungry and didnt want to venture far for a meal  service was greatly improved compared to the first time  They politely requested that we switch to another table  to make room for a large party  They thanked us for the trouble with a free appetiser  Overall  a good value for the food and service ,?
1129090,First cleaning at this office and it was awesome!  I had a deep cleaning in fact and I didnt even need to be numbed!  Love this office and staff!  Really appreciate how they take very good care of their patients!!!!  Dr  Katie Benavides is AWESOME!,?
1129392,First encounter: Ordered togo even though I was running behind food was still kept warm Second encounter:My husband and I sat a whole day just watching football  our food was never delayed and they made sure to keep checking on us  It was a great environment  relaxed and amazing food!!! The staff are all so great as well! Definitely going back!,?
1129804,First experience: Super Bowl Sunday 2015  we were overcharged by 200$ without any compensation and our server knee  The place is very clean All of the bartenders and servers are very friendly and attentive  Their food options are incredible and very unique (not your traditional bar food ) beer is very affordableSecond experience: we sat at the table for  20 minutes with no one attending to us  I walked up to the bar and the bartender literally snapped at me saying uh someone will be with you and pointed to my booth  Our server was really nice but all he had said is sorry hope you werent here too long and didnt check on us after at all except once to ask if we wanted more drinks  The place wasnt even empty  I just wanted a beer     Then when the check came we waited for 10 minutes and I had to go up to the bar     ,?
1131025,First lady was amazing but about 15 minutes into an hour massage they switched and next lady was ok   Really not ok but not horrible   If the first lady wouldnt have done such a good job  i would probably have given 2 stars   Never had them change during a massage  Very awkward and I wish they would have warned me   I will not go back,?
1132409,First of Home Depot uses them for flooring installations  I love HD but US Installations has a weak office team The carpeting and tiling guys were amazing  Outstanding work from those professionals  After the tiling install two of the three toilets in our house were leaking  I shut them off and called US Installations for them to come out and take a look  First guy never showed up  Second guy came in and said they are not leaking  my wife said then why is their a stain on the ceiling below? He said he waould have someone come out and reinstall  That was a week ago and I have heard nothing  Inexcuseable!We have 5 in our house with one functioning toilet after this $21 000 flooring installation   After two weeks  I decided to fix the issue myself   leak free ,?
1132879,First of all I want to say how the manager MAYRA is a little bitch shes a fucking rude ass manager they gave me some dried ass chicken with some cold ass mash potatoes!!! And hard ass rock chocolate chip cookies i ordered ! And this bitch ass hoe Mayra was been rude to me because I wanted my refund ! Wtf is wrong with her dark ugly monkey looking bitch ass !!! All the workers there look musty as fuck specially some employee name EVELIN her fats assss    she wasnt even working she was been a little hoe with the other workers talking to them looks like she flirting around    ! When they should be working ! And giving us some warm food not like my dried up chicken and cold mash! And my god deam chocolate ship cookies hard ass rocks ! This place is infested and dirty along with the workers !!!! It neeeedddssss to be closed down Im tired of this god deam KFC shit ! Aint ever going back there !,?
1133027,First of all Id like to point out the hard work of Kelby not only did he keep in touch via text during my job he also took the time to unroll each roll to make sure that I was satisfied with the product   We used the recommended installer Mero and I have included a picture of the final product ,?
1133586,First of all salsa is very different but we loved it  more chiles than tomatoes   Great nachos  lazy beef tacos and shrimp tacos   all very good would return  and we are food snobs!,?
1133614,First of all that Robert W review is fake AF Been going to Arcadia Eyecare for about a year now and Dr Anderson and his staff have been nothing but amazing for service and quick turnaround for prescription glasses  I had to get some sunglasses redone with a new prescription and ended up getting some new prescription sunglasses while I was there  My appointment was around 4pm on a Thursday and received a call to pick them up Friday the following week  I was told 7 to 10 business days  thats pretty quick to me  Was told upfront all costs associated with my insurance and what my portion was  My old and new pair of Sunglasses are amazing  Dr Anderson is making me feel like I have robo sharp vision  I wouldnt go anywhere else for top notch service and a laugh while Im getting my eyes checked!!!,?
1134201,First of all we waited for 1 hour to get seated by our server  Not impressed with the seating area but we were there to have a taste of Guys menu since we enjoy watching his tv show  To our disappointment burgers were just average and fries were awful   Dont waste your money here and instead enjoy a fast food joint like Shame Shack  We will stick to the tv show     ,?
1134219,First of all what kind of sports bar has table minimums? Total BS  And I would have been ok with it if the food had actually been decent     Not what I expected at all from one of Emerils restaurants!! I had the French dip sandwich  which basically tasted like something youd get at TGI Fridays    and to make it worse  the au jus was bland and tasteless! My wife got a burger so greasy that the bun fell apart halfway through  THE ONLY saving grace was the grilled asparagus    seasoned well  Our waitress was slow and forgetful  and only seemed to start to pay more attention to us when it was time to pay the check   The setup was pretty cool  especially in the center of the restaurant with the stadium seating (i can only imagine how much they charge for those tables) and the HUGE tv setup     But correct me if Im wrong    A Legasse restaurant should be about the food first    Overall    I would suggest spending your money at other notable vegas restaurants!,?
1135018,First of all  I want to start off by saying that the customer service here is EXCEPTIONAL!!! It can be difficult to find good  nice people in the car service industry but these folks prove that you definitely can!! I came here with my brother yesterday and Keith took amazing care of us  He recommended certain things for our 15000 mile checkup and made sure to check the battery as well so my brother wouldnt get stranded with a bad battery  I highly recommend Autonation Honda!!!,?
1138224,First off I want to tell you that Dawn and Cindi are the best waitress I have seen next to Candy my Daughter and I go there quite often and we have never been disappointed and the Managers are fantastic too every time someone comes into town we take them there   we were told they might be closing down for remolding I told the Manager I will put up a tent while they are remolding and wait for them to reopen   All the staff is great but Cindi  Dawn  and Candy wait on us a lot always hugs and kisses from them   Thank you for making Black Bear so great I love the place   Marie Dexter,?
1138548,First off THANK YOU SO MUCH PAULO for letting us sit at the bar towards the end of a Sunday night  Second  thanks for the heads up on the 45 minute wait for the BEST PIZZA  So worth the wait  Plus this bartender is a great person! Hes super down to earth and a funny guy over all  He was great at getting us drinks while we waited for the deep dish! Over all great experience  and definitely coming back every time I come into town  I will come see you again my friend  Thank you ,?
1138702,First off great beer and amazing Christmas ale! But they are called a brewery for a reason    so dont expect much out of there food  I ordered the old world burger and after the second time they brought it back it still taste awful! I also forgot to mention all this happened after a 2 1/2 hour wait when they said 90 minutes and us repeatedly going back  Although the manager and the servers were great to deal with it was so so  I guess Ill just stick to getting the beer at a local grocery store!!,?
1139472,First off the food is delicious but you go here for the fresh fish   The tacos are proportionately large and the price is fine for the quantity and quality of food   If you want a white table cloth go somewhere else   If you want flavorful food and friendly and timely service step on in and enjoy! Worth the trip just make certain your expectations are right   This is a paper napkin   juice running down your arm after biting into a taco kind of place    exactly what I was looking for!  Dont forget to try the calamari!,?
1139740,First off there are two different Linos location  we have only always gone to the one on Tenaya  We have been ordering from here for about 7 years  We are picky about our pizza as my husband is from NY and we have to have good dough  If you like spicy their Giardiniera sauce  (Italian condiment) is a favorite of mine  We order from here a couple of times a month ,?
1140232,First off  Classpass Flex is amazing it has enabled me to try some really cool fitness classes across the country  Ive been wanting to test out Surfset for a while now but we dont have it on CP in DC  so I was really excited to stop by the Vegas location!I took a Burn class with Leah and it was a really tough workout! I was the only customer at 5 PM so I got lots of oneonone attention as I wobbled my way around the surfboard  Turns out doing squats and cardio on a surfboard trainer is NOT easy  but I really loved the challenge  Id highly recommend this studio for anyone looking for a unique  challenging  and fun way to get in shape ,?
1140262,First off  Flipn Chicken falls into my top 2 of all time best lemon pepper wings spots   Tbh I cant get off those so can only give a review on those and  the garlic parmesan flavor   Yes I get personal when it comes to wings    The GP dont disappoint either  They were packed with garlic flavor and heavy grated parmasean  Warning ladies wipe your lip glass off first! Joseph  the Manager  recommends the mix of lemon pepper/ which is oily with the medium wings  In fact  you can mix it up like TI whatever you like! Ive been eating here for 3 years and they are absolutely consistent  Bread sticks ( day 2 into my low carb plan)  are buttery deliciousness in what tastes to be like yeast dough  I just had a bite of one   Just learned a little factoid during the 2016 Super Bowl they sold over 10 000 wings!  I rest my mic,?
1141396,First off  Ive been going to loads of dealerships recently and its been an absolute nightmare  I almost gave up! So glad I didnt  I asked about a car online and Victor called me immediately to discuss  My offer was accepted and I couldnt come that day to test drive so he kept me updated through the day the following day so I could come drive immediately after work  During the day he took care of my financing so it would be ready to go when I arrived! I got there and he had waters ready and the car pulled inside so I could check it out  I loved the car and decided to purchase and he immediately had everything ready! Once I got to financing  Giuseppe Ferrera was outstanding! He was up front and definitely knows his stuff  No hidden fees or games here!The whole process was extremely painless and easy  10/10 recommend  MB Gilbert  You have a customer for life now!!!!,?
1141409,First off  Ive never been a huge fan of Cold Stone but the daughter wanted it so we gave it another try   I wasnt impressed again   Im just not a big fan of having chunks of things mixed into my ice cream  especially chunks of chocolate because they get hard as a rock   If I end up here again  I think Ill just stick to some plain ole ice cream   Service at this location wasnt great either   There is no sign telling you where to order so there was a line about six people deep waiting by the register while the two employees stood in the middle just chatting it up amongst themselves   It wasnt until the first person in line walked over and asked where to order that they finally realized they were at work and they had quite a few customers   I think Id rather go to DQ for a blizzard   ,?
1142554,First off  super delicious burgers  but youll wait for it   Youll wait for drinks too  and you bill  Everything is good but the biggest thing keeping me away is the very slow service I cant seem to get more then 2 drinks anytime I go  My pint glass will sit empty forever! Its a combination of lack of staff and the staff being frustrated by it  that translated into the long wait ,?
1142704,First off  the entrance is quite hidden  around the corner and through a backdoor  I was also seated in a semicircle lounge type seat so it was kinda odd because it was right in the main hallway where everyone walks by and looks at you and what youre eating  They have quite an extensive menu but the food was so so  Ill probably only be back if a group of friends want a variety of different things ,?
1143185,First off  these guys arent even based in Vegas  They market and middleman their business  They hired me twice to service clients and on the second gig  refused to pay the agreed upon invoice  Emails requesting payment status have been ignored  Dont work for them and if you are looking for aerial in Vegas  find an actual local provider ,?
1144374,First place off the subway and I needed coffee  Glad I stopped in  Very friendly service  cool light fixtures and great coffee  Had an iced Americano and a cappuccino  both were supreme ,?
1145611,First they auto grat for 18% with a party of 5  2 being children  They service was worth nothing  Would have totally given more but your service needs improvement and let me decide what your hospitality is worth ,?
1145746,First thing I notice is how clean this place is   Service was great  The food was amazing  Everything was really really good  I got the brisket sandwich and it was sooooooooo good  My hubby got the Wilmington and he loved it  He said it had a little spice to it which made it even tastier  Definitely would come back and recommend this place,?
1146468,First things first  the decoration in this restaurant is wonderful  Very open  very honeys  The most beautiful Mexican restaurant Ive been to hands down  Chips and salsa were nice  nothing special  Friend ordered the chicken burrito lunch combo  massive plate of food  cooked to perfection and delightful in her own words  My order was the spinach burrito  with guacamole salad substituted for the rice  Spinach was seasoned well  and the chile con queso on top was incredible  Guacamole was just a bit bland  but still good  Refried beans were wonderful  Service was incredibly fast  and immensely friendly  I will be returning here  and hopefully soon ,?
1146546,First things firstHost team  thumbs up! Very welcoming & sweet  I like it when the hosts address me  instead of me having to get their attention  Michael H  was an awesome server  he was very helpful & attentive  It took us a few minutes to figure out what we wanted & he was very patient  Not to mention  he kept our glasses filled with water the entire meal   which is quite a feat  considering we drink like fish  Shrimp Scampi Crostini excellent  very rich in flavor & THICK for a small plate  White Bean Hummus very refreshing  I think I might even prefer it prepared with white beans as opposed to chickpeas  The red velvet cheesecake was TO DIE FOR  My goodness! My boyfriend isnt even a fan of red velvet  & he said it was the best cheesecake hes ever had  Great experience  all around!!!,?
1147441,First time I had chipotle  blew my mind  Really messes up my stomach because I always get the hot salsa and barbacoa  but Ill always keep coming back  Chipotle you da real mvp,?
1147917,First time I was here it was for a dinner  Food was great  Resturants clean and staff was friendly too ,?
1149296,First time at DC Steak House and most likely my last   Had the strip steak and it was OK  no complaints   No matter how good the food could of been  the terrible service by Danny ruined it all   Believe we were there for almost 45 minutes before we even ordered dinner   Thought maybe he was fired a couple of times since we didnt see him for so long   It was a Sunday and not busy so could only imagine how bad things are on a Friday or Saturday   A friend of mine that works in the industry called and spoke with a manager and guess he really didnt much care   So  glad business is good that you do not have to care!  There was a group of 7 of us and this place will probably not see any of us any time soon   Keep up the awful service and not caring and Im more than happy to take my business elsewhere ,?
1149690,First time at LoLos  and they didnt disappoint  Had to try some of the classics  so I opted for a KKs: Three piece  southern style  two waffles  grits & two eggs with cheese and onions  The chicken and waffles were obviously their staples  and they were oh so tasty  The eggs were a little bit overcooked (ordered over medium  yolks came out solid) but the grits were great with just the right amount of butter  Unfortunately  the sweet tea was not so sweet as the tales suggest  and oddly enough  was actually different color in each of the three glasses that we ordered   Overall I think this first experience was enough to warrant a return visit to try their shrimp and grits   ,?
1149876,First time at Over Easy even though we only live about a mile away!  Our new goto breakfast stop   Great corned beef hash (which I havent had in years)   Great service   A little pricey but worth the cost   Patio was packed   Well be back!!,?
1150319,First time at Vertuccio farms and it was very fun! I went during fall break so it was very busy  The farm may look small but there is a lot to do  I was shocked that all the rides were included ( except for the barrel ride) with the admission  Theres so many activities  The only thing I was disappointed with was the pumpkin patch was not open to the public it was closed for field trips ,?
1150518,First time at a Wincos  my partner has been to one and due to my skepticism  I went  I went in to look and just get some produce  I ended up buying about 15 bags of groceries  produce  meat  frozen foods and can goods for about $55 dollars  I enjoyed the convenience of shopping at one store for my regular shopping  I go to whole foods  Walmart  Costco and food 4 less at times for their prices  I will be coming back ,?
1150719,First time at madhouse coffee absolutely amazing staff coffee and pastries were all delicious  The spot off Decatur is 24 hours and has hookah!,?
1150776,First time at rise and shine  first review Ive bothered to write for a restaurant   Had the chicken fried steak and it was delicious   Will be back again  I only fear writing this review will make it slightly more crowded,?
1151344,First time at this establishment   Kudos for the food and service   Both were very good   However  the other patrons  which we assumed must be regulars  do not take kindly to newcomers   On the dance floor  which is quite small  we were consistently bumped into and jostled  The looks we received  definitely made us feel we were not welcomed   Sorry to say  we will not be back or recommend this establishment for anything more than a good meal ,?
1151621,First time at this location  often go to the Bobs in Castle Shannon  Long wait for service  Food consistent to other Bobs ,?
1152037,First time at this place  asked some friends where I should take the wife out for dinner on her birthday  They all suggested this wonderful little place! And I think the fact that the waiter was very helpful was what made this trip a success  shout out to her  Julie! We asked her what the best type of pizza was she said Tuscan  this is one of the best pizzas Ive ever had! We saw a lot of different dishes coming out and they all looked very tasty so we will definitely be back to try the other stuff !,?
1152732,First time bringing my pup here and we will definitely be coming back! So glad I finally found a great groomer!,?
1153014,First time coming here   def recommend   Ordered the fried rice w/ shrimp to go  it was delicious  Price was a little on the high side for what I got  but it was worth it   Waiter was very nice   gave me a free glass of water while I waited for my food   It was a nice  quiet environment   Might try the ramen next time ,?
1153095,First time coming here and I really love it everyone was so nice have a really good collection of nails polish,?
1154183,First time customer and now a customer for life  Never again will I buy a frozen pie from a grocery store bakery  So many choices and friendly staff  Happy happy happy ,?
1155067,First time eating at Dickeys today  I had the pulled pork sandwich and it was great  Plenty of lean meat and a super fresh bun  Several kinds of selfserve barbecue sauce in warming pots  Nice  My partner had ribs with mac and cheese and cabbage slaw sides and was very happy with quantity  freshness  and taste  We will be back!,?
1155323,First time eating crawfish  first time eating anything of this concept  so I must say it was a trip!The service was great  the girls came by and explained everything to us  I was a little thrown off at first  because theres a disposable tablecloth right in front of you and they throw down a plastic bag of crawfish/shrimp/whatever  laden with sauce and a corn/potato/whatever thrown inside  And you just kind of dig in! Crawfish itself is kind of hard to eat  or difficult  since you go through sooo much work and the result doesnt really yield much  Im much more of a shrimp kinda girl  but the sauce and all that licking made it worthwhile  This place is great  would come back again  My only complaint is (that since Im such an environmentalist) they throw EVERYTHING away  from cups to plates to forks  I mean  i get it  its easy clean up and all  But the poor environment! Anyways  thats just my qualm  Everything else was great ,?
1155340,First time eating from here  I had food delivered from Postmates   I got the Spicy Tuna rice bowl and all I can say is  I AM IN LOVE!!!  It was SOOO delicious and plenty of food  I couldnt finish it   The Tempura eggplant was amazing  very flavorful   For you fellow ginger lovers out there  their ginger was VERY good  white pickled ginger that is a tad sweeter than most places  but very good none the less   Happy Customer  will be back!,?
1156208,First time ever buying a bed  I was super worried about  how I was going to pay for my bed and if it was going to be delivered on time since I bought my bed 2 days prior to move in  Denise who helped me took care of all my problems  When my application for financing came back denied she called them and found out why and had me approved  She took the time to find me the right bed by having me test out several beds in my price range  She truly took care of me and didnt treat me as a sale but actually took the time to sell me what I needed and wanted  I appreciate what she did and recommend her to any new bed buyers!,?
1156275,First time ever eating at this fun little deli sandwich shop  Many options to choose from  and made fresh right there  The sandwich was huge  and I had both a salad and half a sandwich   Very feeling  and tasty  Not sure why I have never heard of this place  and kinda feel like I have been missing out  Maybe I should get out more  Making a subtle hint for my husband   not sure if he will even read this review or not  but anyway very yummy  Glad I had a chance to try it  Moving on up in my little world  ha ha ,?
1156373,First time ever going to a rotating sushi bar  and it was a neat experience for me and my boyfriend  The guys making the sushi were lively and fun  but our server was a little bit scattered  We werent given a menu either and had to ask for one instead to figure out how things were priced (its by plate color  white being the cheapest and then prices rising a little as yellow  blue  purple  and black)  Has pretty much all of your typical classic and specialty rolls  and it all seemed pretty fresh  As far as the concept goes  really cool  but kind of weird if you consider that your food has been stared (or possibly touched  ah!) at by 20 other people probably a good 23 times before you plucked it off the conveyor belt circling the restaurant ,?
1156527,First time ever today  When I walked in the place looked like a 80s dance club with the mix of your average diner  The chicken is what makes this place Canes  I mean seriously  they got some MEAN chicken  The cashier was very nice and inspirational  This place is awesome and I would recommend it to anyone who likes chicken  Which is basically everyone ,?
1156743,First time floating and it was a great experience  Wasnt sure what to expect but easy check in process and very relaxing  Staff is very knowledgeable and welcoming  Looking forward to my next float!,?
1157025,First time getting a chicken shawarma from this joint and it was delicious! The man taking our order was sweet and told us to call ahead of time so we dont have to wait in line if were in a hurry  Ingredients tasted fresh and the sauce was pretty good  Not a bad place for affordable and yummy food  Would come back again! Tip: wouldnt really come here with a group of people as there are only 34 tables  Take out is just as good though!,?
1157386,First time going here and all in all not a bad sandwich   I ordered the club without honey mustard   Total 4 91 and a short wait   The sandwich itself was very tasty and I liked the bread   The tomatos had a good flavor too   I would like to try a few more of the sandwiches they offer and the lemonade ,?
1157823,First time going to Virgils  Locals for over 25 years and always willing to try new places  Got there at 530pm after CES  They sat us quick which was great  But then we sat there waiting and waiting with servers walking by us for almost 20 min   Not one person stopped and even dropped water  We asked for service and the server said sorry not my table so finally when we got up and said WE ARE DONE then  they finally said  ok I will help you  Stopped at front area and informed management that this was the worst service ever seen  Brand new place open for only a few weeks and not that full to have such a bad experience  I am Shocked to see its starting off so bad    Bad management  just need to revise customer service  wanted Ribs came to Guy Fieris  and had some serve us under 1 min great service   Thanks for nothing  !!!!,?
1157932,First time going to the restaurant  the restaurant inside is actually bigger than I thought because outside looks small  Food arrived quick  portion is not as much as some other Hong Kong style cafe that I go to  Food taste I will give them 7 5/10  Service is quick and utensils seem clean to me  I will go back some other time and maybe it deserves a higher rating ,?
1158877,First time here I always look to see if a shop is clean and it was  I enjoyed listening to old school hip hop while getting my cut  Its next to a Robertos and jamba juice you cant beat that lol  I used to go to Alan at his previous shop and was super bummed to hear he had left and they supposedly didnt know where he moved to  I found him through a coworker out of luck! Hands down he gives the best cuts!! You wont be dissapointed! Some barbers just cut hair because its a job  but you can really tell he has a passion for it!,?
1158924,First time here I would have given 5stars but 3 starts it is  Food was great and fast the atmosphere is electrifying and exciting and fun  Amber was on top of everything thank you  but the way other servers were talking to each other next to guest and all on there cell phones was not hospitality like,?
1159118,First time here and I am so lucky that Nanette (not sure how to spell her name)  She was so accommodating and really was good in what she do  I was very skeptical at first to have a blonde hair specially with my skin color BUT it turned out really good  I love it!!! Definitely coming back here!,?
1159302,First time here and I like it raw  The fish was very fresh and flavorful  Roll was well made with just enough rice  Presentation was beautiful  Wish I had taken a photo but was so hungry couldnt wait  Service was quick and friendly   Beautiful decor and felt somewhat absorbed in the Japanese culture with the Japanese music playing very romantic even though I was alone in the middle of the afternoon  The big screens put me off a bit but not too much since they were silent   thank you  Checked in on Yelp and got a small hot sake   yeah!I bookmarked and will certainly return soon ,?
1159544,First time here and I was happily satisfied   Ive drove by before always seemed closed finally on this day I drive by and happen to see someone going in   Made a quick turn and walked on in      people had been telling us about this spot since weve been looking for a fish and chips place   The batter was just right and golden brown   Chips was plenty and yummy   Will come back and try some Korean food since it looked so yummy ,?
1160263,First time here and had a pedicure done by Demi  she was super friendly and did an amazing job! I definitely will be back!,?
1160511,First time here and it was amazing! The service was fast  the food was excellent and the people who worked there were really nice  The meat was so fresh and the sides were so tasty and the macaroon ice cream sandwich was the icing on the cake  Will recommend this place to everyone and bring my family wholl be visiting next week,?
1160637,First time here and it was great   Ambience was perfect  not too loud and no too intimate   I tried the calamari which was perfect   Not soggy like most places   The Lasagne was amazing   I had a bite of the chicken parm  It was was really good as well   I definitely recommend this place as the service and food was excellent !!,?
1160977,First time here and man it blew away my expectations! Not a huge pizza person but this place made me fall in love! Definitely what you would consider original Chicago deep dish  Tons of flavor and sauce  The bread was cooked perfectly and it was just enough to sop up the tons of sauce  One of the must visit places in Vegas whether youre a pizza lover or an occasional eater like myself you will live it!,?
1161274,First time here and the Acai Bowls are pretty good  I wasnt blown away  but they dont cheat you on the pure Acai (which I prefer over blended) like most places do  Got the large size and felt like I had enough to feed a family of 3  definitely too much  They use the freshest ingredients and theres a nice atmosphere to eat in  The place has a rustic/cottage/beach feel to it  And its very clean which is why I gave it a 4 star vs  3  Ill definitely try it again if Im on this side of town ,?
1161623,First time here and this place is great  Food is amazing and atmosphere is good  Will definitely be back,?
1163288,First time here probably my last! Advised the barista it was our first time here  and apologized in advance if I didnt order properly  When ordering the baklava  I asked for a rectangle sized one  She laughed and gave me a lovely look and said we only have square or triangle  And thennnn she gave me a triangular one  Look lady  everyone can see your eye roll  Its RUDE  Pretty decent coffee but lose the sass ,?
1164154,First time here with my honey    I had the garden omelette and he had the peach pancakes both were outstanding!   Reasonably priced good service,?
1164298,First time here! And I fell completely in love! Cant believe it took me this long to find this place! The food was amazing!!!! I had the pimp shrimp  perfect serving portions  and skinnyFATS punch juice  The cashier was absolutely sweet and helpful  her name was Kathryn  Id definitely be back very soon,?
1164409,First time here! Jason (the manager) was attentive  informative  and answered all questions even though they were fairly busy  He also made sure to check on us and our food  This place was extremely clean and the sushi was very fresh  I will be coming back here again without a doubt!! Thanks again Jason!,?
1165124,First time here  definitely not our last! Food was delicious  salsa that came with burrito was too salty  served hot and timely  There was a gentleman playing guitar and singing music that was appropriate for the time of day  Staff was great and the store is super clean!!!!,?
1165410,First time here  its a great location   and nice view Inside  its a bee hive   Saturday eve  most of the place is reserved tables  and the rest is crowded  They have a band that starts at 6 and ends at ten  so if you come to hete music  get here early  The band is on a level all on itself  Sitting in the upstairs bar  can barley here them  If you go downstairs to the other bar  only two small tables  Not sure where one would go to listen ? But  the food is plentiful and oh so good  Filet was perfect  great bread and honey butter  Corn  tasty The Best  is the beef ribs  OMG  ive ever had any better  Blackened and tasty  and all you can eat  After  10  I was stuffed  Ill be back for sure ,?
1166259,First time here   Had the carne Asada taco and the carnita taco   Both were very good   I have had better of each as well   Ordered the cilantro lime rice and the charro beans for sides   The rice was fabulous   The charro beans were good  but again  I have had better    I had the guacamole with chips to start   Have only had comparable guac at Frontera   It was the best part of my meal!,?
1166555,First time here  Beautiful salon  skilled  technicians and reasonably priced  Ive found my new nail salon home!,?
1166735,First time here  Enjoyed the cheese soup and BBQ chicken flatbread  Good sized portions  There were 7 of us and everyone enjoyed their food  Fast service on a Friday night ,?
1168209,First time here  We came for my sons birthday  Its actually pretty cool that they announce the birthday and have them sit on a little saddle and give them a shout out to the whole restaurant  It made my son feel special  I thought the food was decently priced and actually pretty good  Our server was Christian he was super awesome and easy going  We went around dinner time so the wait was about 1520 minutes so expect to wait that if you come during dinner maybe even longer  I was recommended by a co worker to come here and will definitely be back!,?
1168302,First time here  Went for a falafel platter  Got 3 brown disc looking things  Tried to take a bite of one and about chipped my tooth  Falafel should NOT be crunchy! Ever  Overly done and bad taste  Not sure what extra stuff they put in their falafel discs but good falafel does not need any extra stuff  Taziki sauce is ok  Rice is good but I didnt come in for rice       ,?
1168325,First time here  What s great addition to the waterfront!  Saw Ernie Krivda with his band along with great singers   Great food too   We will be back!,?
1169009,First time in Huntersville  we found these beautiful neighborhood shopping center through Yelp We had a nice afternoon  walking  shopping  Had a Frappuccino in Starbucks  bought mags at Barnes & nobles and something at Dicks Theres a theater movie  a few restaurants but we couldnt finish to see everything because of the weather  (It was raining heavily)We didnt have any problem to park  Therere available street parking and private parking (free) Very nice  For sure well be back if we are near Huntersville ,?
1169285,First time in Vegas and this was the first restaurant I came to  Got here late and needed a place to grab a quick bite  so decides to stop here and boy  was it a good bite to grab  Had a cup of chili for starters and it was so yummy  Ordered a burger for my main course and it was juicy and flavorful  My buddy got the fish and chips  which I wish I wouldve gotten  and holy moly was it good  Really cant beat the taste of this food for this good of a price  Good way to start off my trip to Vegas!,?
1169540,First time in and it was great   Huge cup of coffee just what I needed to start my day  Scrambled eggs were perfect and my biscuits and gravy was amazing  Highly recommend   Linda was our server   Very nice quick with refills and very attentive   We will be back!,?
1170026,First time in to eat sirio  I heard they had a new chef and tasty new menu! Was impressed with the dinner from start to finish Everything was clean and fresh tasting  Gm stopped by to touch the table! Highlights were pumpkin tortellini  ricotta dumplings and shrimp scampi  Cannoli is a must! We would recommend and will be back ,?
1170444,First time last week after a Checkers game and it was pleasant   Nothing extraordinary  but nothing terrible   It was crowded  but its a BAR   Drinks were decent and not overly priced   The patio was very chilled and not as packed   Would I be a frequent visitor here?  Probably not with all the other great bars around town  but it was a nice first time experience and would recommend that if youre new to Charlotte that you give it a try at least once!,?
1170645,First time ordering and having it delivered  The food was at the door in about 30 minutes  Food all looked good  Steamed dumplings  boneless ribs  and spicy shrimp  Serving size was good what was not very good was flavor  Everything was very bland  No taste in the dumpling dipping sauce  Boneless ribs were very sweet  just not my style  Spicy shrimp defaults to medium heat and I changed that to HOT  It was very bland   No real flavor let alone any heat ,?
1170700,First time ordering from Jaipur and I LOVE it! For is incredible  owner was very friendly  Will order again!!,?
1170989,First time out to this establishment and they advertise home made chicken  Our server was nice but our order came out all wrong and fried chicken was very dry for home made! Our server tried to make it right by giving us a free beer which we never got and then brought a take home box with the piece of chicken that was ordered and never received and a side of baked beans  The beans were so runny that trying to take it home in the Styrofoam box would have be a big mess in the car so we left the take home box on the table and left  What a disappointment but will not visit again  Next time I want chicken I will visit Kentucky Fried!,?
1171005,First time participant   Had a great time   Its amazing how fast these little carts go   Will do again when I return to Vegas ,?
1171023,First time patient  got an aggressive treatment plan  Was very glad I got a second opinion  Would not go back or recommend to others ,?
1171220,First time seeing a movie here with my son  We had free movie vouchers and saw Star Wars  The seats are comfortable but  sitting in row M  I had a hard time reclining the seat and still being able to see the screen  Im 53 so not too short! The wall separating the rows was really in the way  Also  the announcement before the movie starts is almost uncalled for  I understand not wanting people to be on their phones but to make a speech about it is ridiculous  Also  I saw a male employee in the theatre on his phone  Maybe they should start that policy with their employees ,?
1171550,First time staying here and we had great customer service at checkin  Room was spacious; king size bed and a couch  Ballys is connected with the Paris Hotel so we had a variety of places to eat and attractions to see besides the gambling  Good location even though the hotel is not on the strip; close enough to walk to  Bring your walking shoes ,?
1171904,First time there after hearing rave reviewsfrom my 18 yr old son who loves it   Went at an off time so not crowded (but the parking lot at this location is terribly designed) I ordered the spicy green chili pork burrito   It was wayyyy too sweet  even the flour tortilla tasted like sugar was added to it   I almost thought I mistakenly ordered a sweet pork but it wasnt   I grabbed a mint lemonade and that too was overly sweet   Maybe its just me but does anyone notice their food sweet?Ill give it another try again   Still like Chipotle over this ,?
1172323,First time there today   We will definetely go again   Food was great and service was great   Great menu!,?
1172503,First time there  nice atmosphere and good food  Must try the fois gras eel sushi  very delicious! Will definitely go back to try other foods in the menu ,?
1173760,First time to try this place  Im curious since they have poke bowls in their menu  Its located on the street level of a condo building where no parking were allotted for the stores  You can park on the side street where theres a fire hydrant  only 3 cars can park or just go to the plaza next to it   I ordered the honeydew milk tea with grass jelly ($5 50 Plus $ 50) and salmon poke bowl ($10 99)   I was the only one inside yet my order took over 25 minutes  The sushi rice was mushy like plasticine  Small pieces of salmon were cooked and too much wasabi mayo   I didnt finish it  Goes into the green bin ,?
1173954,First time traveling without my spouse where I needed to rent a car  Wasnt to sure the mechanics of how everything worked but it was a breeze  They were training new employees at the desk but it posed no problems  There were plenty of other reps there to assist new employees  I came with a credit card in my husbands name which I could not use but the rep at the counter was accommodating and we found a solution that worked  I would rent from this location again ,?
1173958,First time tried Zoup  ordered Chicken caesar salad and corn & roasted red pepper soup  Soup is just as normal  but the salad is NOT so fresh at all  The salad is frozen and getting black    From the pics u might have the idea what I was trying to say    ,?
1174076,First time trying Chinese hotpot and it was delicious! It was a great experience  Good music  food  and service  Xiao was wonderful!,?
1174400,First time trying Shake Shack  have been hearing about it for years  It was a good burger and fries  definitely worth it but not sure it fully lives up to the hype   For a place that was really busy  service was still friendly and fast ,?
1174965,First time trying someone new after using the same person for more than 20yrs but wanted someone close to home since moving  Amy was great  She made me very comfortable  explained how she does things and impressed me with her friendly yet professional attitude  I got a wax and it was not painful at all  I know she took her time to do a good job and I wasnt rushed  I am definitely going to use her again ,?
1175004,First time trying the chicken salad chick and Im hooked  Its a amazing place to get chicken salad  You can sample all there chicken salads and find the perfect match for you  I got the Sassy Scotty and was amazed at the rich flavor  I also had there Grape Salad and omg words cant describe how delicious it is  The staff are very helpful and friendly  My favorite part is that you can take a pound home with you  Im in love!!!!,?
1175214,First time trying this place 2 weeks ago and I was very happy  Ordered sashimi and the ouster  They were pretty awesome  The all you can eat was terrific  I thought that since it would be all you can eat I thought the quality would be bad but I was very surprised  We will be coming back again ,?
1175437,First time trying this place out found it because some friends told me about it  When I saw they had boba and soft served ice cream i made sure to make it a point to come here on my next day off  The place had great music playing and is neat and clean  I love the fact that they have seating outside as well  Ill be making this my once a week stop for an afternoon treat ,?
1175457,First time trying this place out  and it was actually okay  I got the Belgian waffle and sweet potato fries  The waffle was good  and crisp  I really came here for a waffle but would go back for the sweet potato fries  My grandma cant taste  and goes by texture so she asked for her hash brown extra crispy and our server offered to deep fry them  Although probably not so healthy it was really good! And my grandma loved them  and loved that our server catered to what we like! She was very friendly and helpful  I though the food could have come out a little faster  but then again maybe I was just hungry  And im sure what we ordered takes some time to cook more  All in all  I like the place and will be back for more sweet potato fries;),?
1175723,First time trying this place  Was recommended by a shop down the street and they didnt disappoint  Menu is simple so you dont sit there wondering what to order  Ended up having the gyro picado and it was delicious  Fries were the perfect kind of crispiness  Make sure to get there before the lunch hour craze ,?
1175754,First time trying this restaurant and it was great   Super friendly servers and food was great   I cant wait to come back and bro g the rest of my family ,?
1176082,First time using this service and definitely wont be my last! Chris was reliable  professional  and got us exactly what we wanted!  Free admission for TAO I had guys & girls in my party  hardly any wait maybe 10 min tops considering there were hundreds and hundreds of people there to see Snoop Dogg  and free drinks for the girls for one hour!  Exceptional service we got email & text confirmations exactly when he said he would and when our plans for  changed (our fault not his   our show lasted too long for us to make it forVIP  club entry time)he tried to graciously accommodate with other options AT THE LAST MINUTE! I would definitely use him and would highly recommend to everyone for all vegas entertainment needs! Very convienient  and hassle free   dont pay $20 30 50or $100 for club admission! Dont wait hours in line! Get treated like a VIP!,?
1176451,First time visit today to see Deadpool 2  Notice I said Deadpool? Im glad you did because the guy sitting in the box office didnt  He gave us Avengers tickets and we noticed upon entry  It created an issue that caused a few more minutes delay  The first delay was the line to buy tickets  It got sorted out but this incompetence was the 1st experience   not good  Cant rate the food since we didnt eat any  I thought about a pretzel but might have been served nachos  Honestly I didnt want to wait anymore  The previews had already begun Cleanliness was ok  Not exceptional but its an older theater  You cant expect new  Overall it was an average  expected experience as far as the theater is concerned  I had a better time with the company I was with  Movie was great too  Deadpool has been one of my faves for years ,?
1178025,First time we came here they were closed  on a Tuesday   So FYI  dont go on a Tuesday   But go any other day  because its great pho!Have been here twice now (3 if you count the first disaster on a Tuesday)  and have been very happy with the pho   Had chicken pho the first time (my goto) and it was good  but theres never really anything special about chicken pho   2nd time I got the seafood pho   Talk about special!  Full of delicious seafood goodness including crab legs  shrimp and scallops   YUM!  Will definitely be back and will probably try their veggie pho next time  but the seafood pho will likely end up being my mainstay here ,?
1178036,First time we came here  it was because I was craving poke and our regular place was already closed for the evening   Now I cant imagine going to Vegas without hitting this place up for a meal   Its about 5 miles from the strip but soo worth the drive   The ladies who work there are super friendly and the food is delish (Ive tried the pork chops  chicken katsu loco moco  and roast pork)   They have specials on Friday nights as well as entertainment (at least on the Friday we were there   Our last trip we went on a Saturday and they seemed to also have had entertainment then but not when we were there) Anywhoo  I dont have anything negative to say about this place     its just good Hawaiian food   Oh  and definitely order the gravy   Maybe 2 of them   Youre welcome ,?
1178707,First time      Fanfreakingtastic!!!! 1/2 sandwich 1/2 salad     the Monterey Club is great but the Pecan Dijon  Salad is phenomenal!!! Open from breakfast brunch and lunch   This is a great little spot on the frontage road heading north of Dunlap   This is a definite must try   Travis was a great server  Didnt try the juice bar but I will definitely be back ,?
1180042,First timers  ordered 2 subs to go  Got home and had the wrong order  Drove back  gave the employee back the subs and reordered  She was very apologetic      But then got home and it didnt have half the toppings I asked for  So We just ate them  was not about to drive back for a second time  But my big question is: arent employees suppose to have their hair tied back or at least have a hat on? That turned me right off,?
1180211,First tried a pour over in San Francisco  so found this place online  Great atmosphere  the server really made the experience exceptional   I think his name was Carlton  The pour over was smooth  Sure glad we made the trip here ,?
1180480,First two times we had their shaved ice it was exceptionally good to the last bit left in the cup  But the last 2 trips have been rather disappointing  almost halfway down into the shaved ice we start hitting plain white snow with no flavor to be found  Employees please take note and make sure you add enough flavor  maybe ill come back ,?
1181853,First visit today on the recommendation of my sisterinlaw   Really nice folks and clean!  The boys were seen together which made it great for me   Loved Dr  Macy   Would definitely recommend ,?
1182800,First went to the location in Prague  and was so excited when they opened in Madison  Amazing ambiance and tea done right ,?
1182857,First workout I got a rash on my elbows from the pad on a bicep curl machine which is an irritating way to start my membership out   They either do not clean the machines or someone is spreading a skin rash    all the equipment is old and has never been replaced since it was a golds gym   You get what you pay for I guess   Staff is usually friendly but you can tell this company wants your money and doesnt want to spend it on upgrades   Do not upgrade your membership because they do not upgrade their gym   I will be keeping my eye out for other gyms in the area   LVAC is packed all the time but it has much nicer equipment   The machines and equipment is indicative of how a gym is ran and this gym is ran poorly ,?
1182867,First year art student aesthetics meets basic hotel fail  If you like having no inroom coffee  premium cable  reliable wifi or a bathroom door that closes  youll love this expensive hovel  The light up bed was kinda neat  but you could probably buy one for what a night here costs  Run away!,?
1184536,First  let me say  I will be going back to Nelly Belly  I dont believe on judging a restaurant strictly on one experienceperhaps they just had an off day When I heard they had a woodfired oven  I immediately became excited  I ordered the pepperoni and three cheese pizzas  The crust was flavorless and had an odd texture  The cheese and sauce didnt taste that fresh  I would recommend the chef take a pilgrimage to NYC to find out how real woodfired pizza is made  I know that sounds elitist  but why not? If youve already invested in the expensive oven  why not go all the way? Im just going to add this a long list of awful pizza experiences Ive had in NE Ohio ,?
1185780,Firsttime visit and not impressed with food quality  Ordered the Pork Roll appetizer  Crisp  although very greasy  outside  inside ingredients tasty  although thicker doughy roll Also ordered the Fried Rice entree with extra chicken  Half the chicken was tough and dried out  Rice was ok  very little broccoli and egg  not the best choice An extra star for the good customer service and pleasant staff who were knowledgeable of the menu  Restaurant was not busy and received very good  quick customer service  It is a franchise and feels like a chain  although still a decent ambiance  Good variety of items on the menu  There are better asian food quality choices in the area Decent Asianstyle food; not authentic but not bad  May try again and order from their black menu ,?
1186386,Firstly  the ambience is cool  its busy  bustling and people are clearly having a good time and enjoying their food  The man behind the counter  was the owner and he was extremely polite  I hate to keep saying cool but that is more descriptive  Very kind  accommodating and wanting you to enjoy his experience  The food was unlike anything Ive had in a crepe  Check out pictures  Where do you get chorizo and eggs in a crepe with homemade salsa? And where do you get a flight of mimosas with different fresh juices? This place is one of a kind and my wife and I absolutely loved it  If you are ever around  give it a try  Im seriously doubt youll regret it ,?
1186510,Firstly  we went here because we saw this place on an episode of Taco Trip  Las Vegas  Food is kinda pricey  but Ill pay for good food  I got the grilled steak fajitas and they were delicious  The meat was perfectly cooked and flavorful  It was a very generous portion as well  but then again for $24 if should be  On the scale of 15  the fajitas were a 5  My mother got the street tacos and although she didnt hate them she wasnt impressed  Her exact words were Im not dying to go back   I on the other hand will be returning  Also  I think the fact that food is non gmo and organic is a hella plus for me ,?
1187204,Fish tacos  tomato and mushroom bisque and highpoint harvest bowl were delicious  Great beer selection  cute outside sitting area and extremely friendly staff  I am definitely coming back!,?
1187801,Five Star Moving is the best moving company here in Las Vegas  This guys were on time like it was establish  their job was amazing  very professional  nothing was damage  they took care of everything  Excellent customer service  very nice gentlemen  So definitely We recommend this moving company   If I can give them 100 stars here I will ,?
1188321,Five star bakery  They have what you want and need   Love the no fuss front of the house  Well done,?
1188493,Five star rating for the venue  not the service or product   This is a really cool Starbucks because of the art   I wouldnt wait in line at any Starbucks in Vegas  because there is always another one in about 300 feet   Check out the pictures!,?
1189950,Five stars  good food great pizza!! The staff is friendly and spot on  Always my go to place  lots of regulars  and that is the sign of a winning restaurant! My wife even likes the pizza and thats a hard one to do!,?
1189970,Five stars no question about it!LGO is one if my phx faves  I love that they focus on locally sourced goods  fresh locally grown produce  eco friendly goods and of course a true focus on making delicious food! Head there for breakfast  lunch or dinner  This cozy spot packs in so much charm its amazing! Youll have sensory overload upon walking in as you set your eyes in wine racks  shelved lined with gifts for all from books to candles  candy kids toys and seriously so much more  Everything is clearly thoughtfully selected  Youll want to buy everything! Ready made salads  sandwiches  fresh juices and more will make for a difficult decision  but you cant go wrong with anything here  And be sure to save room for dessert or take some to go! Its simply gorgeous  LGO is upbeat and refreshing  This place can get packed but they manage crowds well and with a smile! Parking is tight  so avoiding peak hours is key  LGO come to Tucson!,?
1190524,Flagged down a cab outside of the casino  The driver was very nice  and knew exactly where we needed to go  His Kia minivan was very clean and did not smell like smoke  He drove normally and took a direct route  Very pleased,?
1191181,Flavorful  healthy food and great variety  Decor and service were just okay  but I loved my jasmines special rice with Lebanese salata  If you like spicy  make sure you ask for hot sauce  Not too hot  but full of flavor  My favorite hot sauce evah!,?
1191859,Flew into Vegas for a quick overnight   Finally got to the hotel    Easy check in (nice to have status and got to our room   Was immediately hit by the smell of smoke (non smoking room)   The room decor is definitely dated   Called downstairs and got another room   Got to the next room and thankfully had no smoke smell   Grabbed a quick shower because I had been traveling   White towels werent that white anymore plus mine was ripped up at the seams and had a hole in it   Obviously that house keeping doesnt really care   Only reason why I stayed was that it was a Hilton Doubletree and got a great corporate rate    So disappointed that Hilton would put there name on this   WILL NOT RETURN!!!!!  Plan to contact Hilton directly ,?
1193279,Foie gras  Oh  foie gras   Nothing surprising   Amazing food  great drinks  spectacular views  topnotch service and high prices   There are so many incredible places in Vegas  but this is a mustvisit at some point if youre celebrating something or if you just want to have a luxurious meal ,?
1193602,Follow up: further to my previous review  I was contacted by management to resolve the situation and discuss concerns  I was given compensation and overall felt much better after receiving an apology ,?
1193644,Followed Nicole over the years since 09   I always feel welcomed and the center of attention when I arrive  The space is small but has everything you need and doesnt feel stuffy  Nice artwork on the walls  great prices  beer  and great conversation if wanted  Guys  give it a chance  Shell make you feel your best without using gimmicks to make you come back ,?
1193738,Following Bree and Ashley again   Downtown parking a little different but like Stacey said  park on 4th Ave much easier   New space same great people  Awesomesauce!,?
1195110,Food I had was pretty yummy and not the typical (which I liked) and the rest of the menu looked pretty awesome too ,?
1195642,Food and atmosphere are great! Staff is friendly and service was good  Great happy hour prices and the regular prices are great as well  The only down side is the water  The water tastes terrible and needs some major filtering  It has a very bad chemical and metal taste  If it wasnt for the water Id give it a 5  Overall at this point 4 5 ,?
1196172,Food and malts were amazingly yummy!! The spuds are a def must   sandwiches are huge ,?
1196924,Food and service was good  Nice location for central PHOENIX ,?
1197082,Food and service was pretty good  They forgot several items during the second round so that does explain the lack of stars  The cheese wontons I ordered looked fairly stingy in size  so portions were alright  nothing amazing  Overall  okay place for lunch  wouldnt say that for dinner though since forgetting items is inexcusable  especially with an ipad system  I would come again  in hopes that they wouldnt forget certain dishes ,?
1197418,Food and service were solid   I feel like this is like a slightly cheaper  not quite as good PF Changs I had some hits and some not quite on target dishes   I loved the Thai wings   Sesame chicken was ehhhh   Coconut shrimp was what it should be  but the sauce was a stand out   Cold peanut noodles were good   Mojitos were good in flavor  but a bit weak in alcohol content Portions were also large for lunch leftovers!I thought the quality was consistent with the price Ill be back for those Thai wings ,?
1197906,Food came out cold service was slow and wasnt even full  waiter not friendly  Dont go!  Waste of money ,?
1198579,Food good  had to wait 10 minutes for tea  Girl forgot  but served it promptly after reminded  Its basically a fast food joint  only cleaner than most Welcome addition to the area ,?
1199029,Food here is AMAZING! We had the tuna tartar with waffle fries (what a delicious and unexpected combination) and pork belly kimchee fried rice served in a hot bowl with fried egg on top    sooooo yummy   Drinks are on point too  My favorite was the pomegranate champagne cocktail  Cant wait to go back and try everything else on the menu,?
1199323,Food here is gasp inducing  Some of the best soul food Ive ever had  Even vegetarians will be pleased with the veggie sides platter  Collard greens off the hook  Candied acorn squash beats anything you ever had for Thanksgiving  Cheesy cauliflower was a bit underdone for my taste  still raw  Famous for their coconut cake  though after their huge slab of cornbread  you might need to hit the gym  Busy place for lunch  allow time  Service reflects the down home hospitality and warmth youd want from a place selling comfort food  Come and feed your soul!,?
1199934,Food in general is pretty good    service isnt   Prices much too high for the size of the portions which are on the small side compared to other Chinese restaurants  We have been here 3 times but probably wont return   We always order enough dishes to have leftovers for the next day   but ordering the same amount of food from Sun Star left us with no leftovers because of the small portions ,?
1200745,Food is adequate  but overpriced  servings are measley  and service is on the slow side  I had the Grilled Steak Salad ($12)  which was good  and a decent amount of steak cooked properly  but not enough greens  It looked a little puny and sad when it arrived   My friend ordered the Chicken Fried Steak breakfast ($13)  and she did not care for the gravy  which was too pastey (i e   old)   Her serving was also small     The eggs  hashbrowns  and chicken fried steak didnt even fill the plate   For the prices charged  the value is just not there I worked at the Monte Carlo 5 years ago and the food in The Cafe was better in those days  The MC is a beautiful property  but I will stick to the Brew Pub on future visits ,?
1201133,Food is always excellent but I am giving a review on customer service  Ryan is EXTREMELY rude and was arguing with me over the phone and even asked me if I wanted to pull up a menu online because he had no clue what I was talkingabout  My boyfriend went to pick up the food and said he was treating the cooks like crap too  Thats none of my business but I will not be returning if you cannot have proper manners when talking to a customer ,?
1201545,Food is always good   Service is really slow  but I still like them   You generally need to clean your own table   The place is always busy ,?
1202890,Food is average for bar food   Beer selection average   Long wait(1hr) for food so this is why it gets three stars ,?
1202919,Food is average to say the most  Tried all kinds of food on the menu: the fried chicken; Takoyaki; Salmon Ball; popcorn chicken (too much breaking  tiny piece of chicken)    Great location though ,?
1203189,Food is awesome! I wish the bar was a bit more welcoming  Youre basically sitting in the kitchen where everything is prepared ,?
1203370,Food is awful   Seating arrangements it is like you are sitting on top ofpeople and you could hear all conversations ,?
1204272,Food is delicious & maple scones are out of this world   The owner  Kirsten  is a class act and the entire staff are very friendly and kind   I highly recommend their breakfast (bacon is a musttry)  lunch  & their juices/coffees/pastries   #yum!,?
1204848,Food is delicious  Service is okay  Ambience is fancy  Prices are pretty inflated  There are better steakhouses in town  IMO ,?
1205063,Food is excellent and portioned correctly but the service is horrible  slow  rude and clueless  bad enough not to care for food quality ,?
1205319,Food is excellent  service is good  and the prices cant be beat  I had a Vegas roll  and the tempurafried batter was perfectly light and crispy  The JapChae appetizer (thinly sliced beef with carrots  mushrooms  and spinach over potato noodles in a sweet and savory sauce) was delicious and an amazing deal  Yakisoba with seafood  portion was huge  seafood was perfectly cooked  and the dish was tastefully seasoned  These 3 dishes and 2 alcoholic beverages only set us back $40 (plus tip  which was welldeserved)  We will definitely be returning!,?
1205346,Food is excellent   Definitely one of the better options to eat in the Ohio City area   They have some of the best pork dishes I have eaten ,?
1206441,Food is good and the people are always nice  friendly amd helpful   The only reason I cannot give 5 stars is that at over $30 for two people I would expect more than the portions given ,?
1207007,Food is good but the service needs work  The one manager with the beard deserves a raise or promotion because he literally was doing everything from taking orders to bussing and cleaning tables and making drinks and he seemed to be the only manager there  Kudos to him!,?
1207221,Food is good fresh service is ok drinks are sammy but good  Mole is really good for ohio  I would come back for sure,?
1208021,Food is good  no real high expectations  its a burger joint  Food is always consistent which is nice  Service though is hit or miss  Last night we had a girls that was pleasant and friendly  she said thank you everytime she left the table even if there was no reason for her to say it  After we ordered we didnt see her until she dropped off check  Heard  Im cut from server station and knew it was her  She was dragging her feet to pick up check because she was busy doing sidework  kinda irritating when you have to hunt down your server to leave ,?
1208482,Food is good  Better to eat in than take out because the proportions for take out are smaller if you order more than one box of the same item  They accept only debit and cash ,?
1208505,Food is good  But terrible service  Ordered on the phone but when showed up at the restaurant had to wait for a long time to pick up the food  They might tell you on the phone that it will take only 20 mins but when you show up 20 mins later  the food will most likely not be ready  And the sad thing is they dont even care that you are waiting ,?
1208689,Food is good  Outside patio is nice   The service is a lil bad  And the overpriced margaritas arent worth the price they charge  But its a decent place for lunch   Oh and the music is awful  Nothing but 96 9 garbage pop music,?
1209033,Food is great and I absolutely adore this joint but I wish they would stop adding salt and pepper to their biscuits   it works when youre eating a savory meal but it just tastes like conflict on my tongue if Im eating it with the preserves and honey ,?
1209297,Food is great but its the service that is truly exceptional!  We go every week for breakfast and they know us by name and have our table ready   Their wait and bus staff are very well trained and food orders are always correct and delivered fast   We have a large group and they tend to special order but its never a problem   We highly recommend this place for breakfast or lunch!,?
1210054,Food is great  but the inside of the place kinda smells like mouse poop  I always leave wondering if there are rodents because of the smell or the place is just old  Wish theyd fix that  Otherwise  id absolutely visit more often  Service is great  bar service awesome  Specials and selections are Right On ,?
1210086,Food is great  but was turned away when i arrived 15 minutes before closing  Wished that at least the offer of something quick to go would have been given  Maybe im just too much into customer service but my thought is you close when you close and not before ,?
1210206,Food is great  prices are ok  service is    high  and the place is kinda dirty  Tables are always a mess! KoolAid on tap which is awesome  Soda was flat both times we went  Second time  after 40 minutes  I went up to check on the order    they had no idea what order  Had to reprint and another 15 minutes later our food came with a sorry  Really want to love this place but guess you have to be totally baked to just shrug off the shortcomings  Meh ,?
1211412,Food is mediocre and over priced  Owner needs to go to charm school  Not worth your hard earned dollars ,?
1211681,Food is nice! I do think that it can have a little more Seasoning  Customer service was OK  I had oxtail  rice and peas  and steam cabbage  I paid $16 00 for the large plate even though there were only about 5 small pieces of oxtail  Ill try the curry chicken next time ,?
1211839,Food is not good at all   We ordered roasted duck for appetizer  but seems the duck was not fresh and more like an overnight thing  They also charged mandatory services fee of over 16%  no matter how many ppl you have and food you ordered ,?
1211859,Food is not good  Being on the lake is great  Would not go back bc of the food  Food was not warm  Flavor was not good  I do not recommend going here ,?
1212070,Food is ok and priced accordingly  atmosphere is nice  They have great specials throughout the week and have kids eat free everyday     the grandkids love going and sitting on outdoor patio,?
1212219,Food is ok for the price    good tasting  but should be more perfected for the cost  Drinks were not good (cocktails)    not sure the bartender had a clue  Clearly we went here on a bad day ,?
1212982,Food is okay   However the aesthetic is really no different than the dumpy old Turf that it used to be   Also  9 dollars for a pint of Grapefruit Sclupin   Ha!  This isnt Los Angeles   Go to Angels Trumpet   Its cheaper  easier on the eyes and they have more than one person serving ,?
1213062,Food is okay  Service is questionable  Needs improvement  Worst coffee I have ever tasted ,?
1213218,Food is outstanding  but dont expect amazing service   Freshest calamari Ive had in a while   The server we had was was not good about simple things   For example  we had to ask for plates for our starter item  which was brought out without any forks or knives  She made three separate trips back and forth from our table just for the starter   Before taking our drink orders she took drink orders from a table which was seated after us   It was very noticeable   Im not sure if the service follies were intentional or just because she wasnt a good server   She was outwardly nice  just not efficient      I like that there are some authentic grocery items available for purchase as well   Generally a good place   Like the rating says  my overall experience was AOK ,?
1213381,Food is phenomenal! Great spot for a healthy lunch  My only complaint is that the glass is too tall in the line and you have to scream in order for the person making your bowl to hear you  I said NO MASAGO   NOT EXTRA ____,?
1213610,Food is pretty good for a divey type bar  Kobe sliders are a must  Bartenders and servers are great and definitely more of a local feel then a lot of bars near the strip  The night I went it was an older crowd 40 somethings it reminded me of a bar I used to go to in Denver  Complete w/ pool tables and an old guy in plaid shirt trying to pick a fight with a guy in our group ,?
1214284,Food is really good  but the service is awful! We have had orders incorrect  and they couldnt care much less  There is a young blond girl who is especially disconnected and lacks any kind of ownership of issues  The kids that work in here act like entitled brats  Thankfully  the kitchen staff seems to know what theyre doing  We would rate this highly if not for the jerky kids up front ,?
1214617,Food is so bad that I threw it away!  They screwed my order and I called to correct it   They said Im the one that told them the wrong item   Poor customer service   Never going there again!,?
1215317,Food is terrible  My son wondered how they could even screw up chicken strips  My burger was tasteless  My wifes burger was burnt  Music was so loud we had to raise our voices just to be heard  If you want a sports bar with much better food and service  try Blue 32 ,?
1215613,Food is very authentic  such a pleasant surprise to eat good Taiwanese food in vegas  We got the minced pork noodle and beef tendon soup both excellent ,?
1216616,Food lacked quality and quantity  They charge for seconds for side dishes  They only allow either water or tea  not both ,?
1216854,Food never disappoints  and service is typically topnotch  The place can get crowed quick  but for good reason  If you sit outside  the audio from the TVs plays on the system  so its a bit distracting  Definitely one of the best options for Mexican in the area!,?
1217498,Food properly prepared however  they put my fillet on top of a bunch of french fries  Not sure what the purpose of the fries were since my fillet came with sauce on it and the fries were soggy and gross  Upon separating the fries from my fish  the fish was flaky and the sauce was delicious  Staples rice was perfectly cooked  beans good not lardy or too pork flavored  tortillas were good  Two stars come from the fact that if you are in the business of selling seafood the restaurant should strive for the best   Soggy french fries holding up my fish fillet was disgusting ,?
1217975,Food selection and quality is OK  my family eats there from time to time  The biggest problem is the staff  They are either hard to find or just rude at times ,?
1218151,Food still good  but the wait was loong  Upon seating  we were told the kitchen was slow today  which Im glad they told us beforehand  On a Sunday afternoon  this place was more packed than Ive ever seen it  Food was gooood  Padseeeww was yummy,?
1219433,Food was OK   The soft drink dispenser did not have any diet sodas available  When asking why there were no diet sodas  the manager blew us off  stating we dont have a cartridge   What kind of restaurant does not have diet sodas in their soda dispenser?  The chopping by the person cutting the meats was very distracting and difficult to carry on a conversation ,?
1220264,Food was alright  the service was HORRIBLE! Both of our orders came out incorrect after waiting extremely long because they dont write anything down when they take the orders  I asked for greens at the end she confirmed did you say grits? I said no greens please   still ended up with grits  Boyfriends whole order came out wrong and when they brought him back the right order pretty sure they brought out my grits they took back 5 min before from my wrong order and gave them to him  Waitress came back and just set the plate down and walked off  No sorry about that  does it look right now  do you need anything else   just straight nothing  Never came by our whole meal to check on us ,?
1220658,Food was amazing with big portions! I got the seafood linguine and it was the best! My husband and cousin got the chicken parmesan   they said it was great except the cheese was a little salty  This is not really a kid friendly place ,?
1221506,Food was average and the service was horribly slow   1015 minutes between wait staff visits is well beyond annoying ,?
1221603,Food was average 6/22/18  Asked for Medium Burger  I got well done and dry   Waited 10 min to get ketchup for the fries  The waitress is nice and friendly  but at times very busy and forgot our order  We got our bread closer to end of the meal ( we had to ASK )  Overall this was a bad experience  not planning future visits ,?
1221717,Food was average  Server was fabulous  Order the clam chowder  have a pickle  a glass of wine and desert  Petit Filet was over cooked ,?
1222107,Food was awesome  Showed up at 11:30 and only a few people around  Took awhile to get seated  Once we received the food it was awesome! Everything tastes awesome  Would definitely come back  Worth the wait ,?
1222507,Food was cold and bland   Customer service was awful  Raz is about the worst restaurant manager Ive ever spoken with   Went for Sunday brunch and was very disappointed ,?
1222850,Food was decent but service was soso  We got the Aburi Lite Omakase and when the food arrived our server just dropped off our plates without a word (even though we observed other tables get detailed explanations of each sushi and garnish)  Also when we had to pay the server just dropped off the machine and disappeared  Small things like that are not deal breakers but it does leave a negative impression Food overall was ok  there were 6 pcs of aburi/Oahu sushi and two hand rolls  I didnt care much for the hand rolls but the sushi was nice and the garnish went well with each piece ,?
1222996,Food was decent  but the manager on duty was super shady  First  no service  we didnt get napkins or water until 20 mins later when we asked for it  At the end  I paid with cash  and waited for change  but there was less $10 bill when the manager gave us the change  When we confronted him about it  he said there mightve been a mistake and he corrected it  This is just not right  some shady things going on! It is unacceptable for a restaurant to not give the right amount of change  and it seems like this manager was trying to do it on purpose!,?
1223196,Food was decent  Ive had much better Indian food  I was SHOCKED that their entrees dont come with rice  especially since they are higher than average prices(~15)  I ordered butter chicken and garlic naan through uber eats and it was $24 45  A little steep for the quality and absence of rice    wont return ,?
1223256,Food was decent  Service was super fast and friendly  The menu had great selections on it  Downside? Though everything we tried was good it was simply lacking the wow experience that I have had at other tapas places  When I walked away from here I remembered an enjoyable meal whereas when I walked away from other tapas places I remembered specific dishes that I would look forward to having again ,?
1223677,Food was delicious and well priced  plus huge portions  The staff was friendly  The place has a trendy ambiance  And if you go  make sure to check out the bathroom (definitely an odd thing to say  but you probably wont be disappointed) ,?
1224849,Food was excellent BUT our WAITRESS was even BETTER! She was so sweet  So attentive and very knowledgeable of all their dishes  Me and my friend asked a lot of questions and she never got frustrated she just kept giving us different suggestions  Her name was Janelle and she was awesome! I will be returning for the food and the staff!,?
1225116,Food was excellent the slim garlic fries were insanely addicting and good  Sweet potatoes fries were awesome as well  Burger was on the money ,?
1225481,Food was excellent   I did not expect korean food of this quality in Las Vegas   Their appetizers are plentiful and the 7 of us ordered the premium for 6 people,?
1226250,Food was fast and fresh! Plus everything was actually there and correct which is rare nowadays with fast food restaurants it seems ,?
1226775,Food was good  had a filet with mushroom rice   Tried to use a Groupon that said it was valid on any day but a federal holiday and New Years   Manager said the owner can choose not to accept Groupon if they dont want to anytime   Would not honor the Groupon and we ended up getting cash value for it ,?
1227043,Food was good and service was efficient  Went there for the all you can eat korean bbq special  Not a bad price for what you get ,?
1227512,Food was good but not great  The main issue is the service  The server was rude  wasnt listening  condescending and never made eye contact  He literally walked away in the middle of my wife asking a question about an appetizer  Too bad ,?
1227568,Food was good but only after we waited an hour to be served  Service was terrible  Noise level was deafening  Mandatory valet parking is a racket  Manager gave us a chit for free entrees if wed come back  I cant imagine that a free meal would induce me to risk enduring such a bad experience again  No thank you ,?
1227609,Food was good but pricey for the amount you get  A taco plate with 2 tacos is $12  Other than that good service and clean restaurant  Id go back!,?
1228638,Food was good  beer was cold  didnt have to wait too long for any of that   these are the good things Our server was a cool guy but not super attentive  We ended up having to ask the hostess for our check because we couldnt find him and as much as we love sitting and staring at each other we also wanted to get up and go nap our food comas off at home  There were only like 3 or 4 other tables in there so its not like the guy was busy   but oh well  Luckily the food runner/fellow server brought out our food when it was nice and hot and the server did come by to check on us  Ive worked in restaurants for many years so I never write a place off simply because of one circumstance of slow service (unless its a common occurrence)  so Ill be back ,?
1229611,Food was good  the teriyaki chicken  beef and pork was the way to go!  The family meal is a great deal!  The macaroni salad was very yummy as was the sauces   Prices were great and my Dads biggest excitement was the fact they offer Spam and Eggs on the menu   We will be back again   Would have given them 5 stars but no Mai tais ,?
1229619,Food was good  this was expected though   Service on the other hand need improvement   Server was uncomfortable and awkward   They also appear to have issues with customizing your order  I had asked for burnt breakfast potatoes (every other breakfast place does this) and they refused   Very odd and to bad  Update:  kinks have been worked out   Service and food are both great!,?
1230064,Food was good  Found out some of our favorites are going away  Im sad   Hope the new items will be just as good or better  The bad thing about dinner last night is a customer was on a conference call 2 tables away  It was so loud we couldnt talk at our table  The waitresses were talking about how rude and loud this lady was  She had the conference calls  3 of them   On speaker  Not one staff member or manager said something so the rest of us could enjoy our meal  We wont be going back since no one has any back bone ,?
1230182,Food was good  I prefer other gyros from other places  I would go back again because they are very friendly and I probably could order something else and like it more  It was a good price for a filling healthy lunch ,?
1230553,Food was good  Staff was good  The ambiance is a bit out dated but retro  Its a cool place to eat ,?
1230687,Food was good  We had the Greek pizza which was refreshingly different than what we usually get  I really enjoyed it  We also tried a few desserts  The eclair was just from a box of frozen pastries  It was eh  The cheesecake was probably purchased frozen as well but tasted better  Might have been fresh  Kids really enjoyed the funnel cake fries but it would be nice if they could use a container that would keep them warmer on deliveries  Delivery was pretty quick but not quite fast enough to keep the funnel fries at their best ,?
1230703,Food was good  We ordered the onion appetizer  Forgot the name now  For mains it was the lamb korma and butter chicken  Butter chicken was decent but not as sweet as I am used to  The lamb korma was spicy and delicious  Probably one of the best I have had  Price wasnt bad  Nice atmosphere  Service will need to improve  The younger waitresses seem lost and the main waiter was too busy  We waited for a bit to order food  But they redeemed themself at the end with more frequent checking in on us  I would go back to try other dishes ,?
1230951,Food was great along with the service  I had salad with salmon added and it was wonderful  Hubby had flatbread and he lived it as well ,?
1231034,Food was great and in large amount! The bread they serve was Yummy and you can have as many pieces as you want  Worth price and definitely worth going! The waiter was so friendly and warm hearted! Pleasant experience!,?
1231044,Food was great and love how easy the menu is for vegetarian/ vegans Amazing!,?
1231505,Food was great but the place was so hot that we could not enjoy it  Just ruined the whole experience  They said that yaaa these tables in the back get really hot  Well dont sit people there then ,?
1232093,Food was great! Service at the bar was great! just a bit weird of a layout at bar by the group table over looking forno oven! Nice surprise tho!,?
1232193,Food was great! This our second time coming to this location  The only reason we are giving 2 stars is because of the happy hour and great sushi! They deserve a 1 star this time because my motherinlaw got rice and took a bite only to have a toothpick in the rice! When we told the manager  he was uncaring! He looked at it  took it away and later came back and said do you want me to just take it off or get a new one? You would expect a little compassion especially since it could have cause a lotof damage!,?
1232917,Food was great  waitstaff were awesome!!  Great way to people watch  as it was definitely a diverse group   It was packed the minute we got there at like 4pm and stayed that way all night   Super fun  would totally go back ,?
1233145,Food was great  Chill and quite spot  Nothing awesome about it  Just simply good and basic customer service ,?
1233743,Food was gross  We left after only eating a few bites  Server was nice  Not surprised its closed now ,?
1234164,Food was just ok not worth the fancy price they charge and then everything is self serve no matter how busy   Brisket was more fat than meat with the hash  omelet the meat was sparse very little cheese  eggs and tortillas was extremely basic   No soft drinks and lemonade was not far from water with lemons for $2 25   The farm setting was nice ,?
1235105,Food was not great  Ok pizza was doable just tastes like heated frozen pizza  However we ordered the mozzarella sticks and they were garbage  The breading fell off and it tasted so gross and bland  My boyfriend who is not picky spit it out because it was gross  They took 30 min to deliver  Then I called to complain and she asked if I still had it so that the delivery guy can pick it back up w the receipt  I thought she meant that the receipt for the return would be given to us  When I asked she(tila) gave me attitude and said we were 12 miles away so he wouldnt be doing that  They would just refund once the mozzarella sticks were brought back   We waited another 15 min and no one came   We called again and they said they would refund the money and to just throw away the sticks  I hope they do return my friends money cuz  no  Also dont advertise and throw fliers under our hotel door if you have a problem delivering to here  ,?
1235150,Food was not that good but waitress like her makes you want to come here again  Ashley was super nice  Excellent customer service  I give her a 5 stars and our food a 3 stars ,?
1235281,Food was off the chain  Service was good  Food came out fast  fresh burgers  will be back,?
1236414,Food was ok    much more expansive than other authentic Asian places The staff there are quite friendly   1 big complaint is we got served our fried rice     AMD 20mins later    we got our other 2 dishes   Doesnt do well for the temp of the rice ,?
1237454,Food was perfect and Carmella was so nice and let us taste a few items before we ordered  My new lunch spot!,?
1237520,Food was pleasant but really unremarkable  I had pho and the cabbage salad  Broth and meat were pretty unspectacular and not tasty  I ate it with hot sauce  It is a nice cosy atmosphere and the friendly service means that I would still go back if I find myself hungry and in the area in need of a quick easy bite ,?
1238150,Food was pretty good  We got the lean meat rib eye pan steak and chicken katsu  Got the steak in medium rare but we recommend rare because its served in a skillet so it continues to cook  It was a bit too chewy and tough to bite towards the end  Chicken katsu was great  sauce was good ,?
1238203,Food was pretty tasty and service was on par  Free Wifi to boot  Nothing special but if you are looking to get the job done while getting your job done  it works ,?
1238565,Food was really good! It was like Vietnamese food with a twist! I will definitely want to try to lobster pho next time!,?
1239718,Food was tasty  service friendly but imprecise   Margaritas not bad   Vegetarians be sure to ask about everything because they use chicken stock in lots of things ,?
1242152,Food  service and restaurant was excellent  I had a lunch special for 7 00 that included soup and salad  My entree of choice was Pad Thai  in which I even got level 2 spice (go me)  It was great and Id definitely return when Im in Vegas! Yum ,?
1242288,Food 4 25Service 1 00We had a reservation for 12 for a casual business dinner  It was moderately busy a few open tables  It took 45 minutes to get our server to take our dinner order  It was very difficult to get our servers attention throughout the evening  We waited on drinks so long that we ended up reordering from the bartender  One person from the group reordered her drink twice and never received it  Really bad service  which is unfortunate because we really like to award good service!The food  once it came  was excellent  Everyone was happy with their order flavor  portions  offerings   Sadly the service (or lack thereof) means we wont be bringing our big groups back here  It really seemed like the server was out of her element  Update: a member of my party shared the experience with a manager and she adjusted the bill to compensate for the service  That earns an additional star from me ,?
1242637,Food:Exceptional burgers and fries   Beef was juicy and moist  Buns were lightly toasted to perfection Service:Extremely busy place  Reservations are definitely recommended  Servers are courteous Decor: Dark with neon lights  Almost feels like a lounge  Very uniquely decorated Would I return:Yes  Reservation made!,?
1243872,Food: DeliciousService: impeccablePrices: very fairAmbiance: perfectThis place is legit     go here!,?
1244147,Food: LOVED (I got the raw lasagna it was to die for!)Service: Terrific! The gal was super amazing and even helped me navigate the menu and avoid my sesame allergy! Not easy to do in a vegan restaurant Atmosphere: Nice  I didnt think the rock music was too loud (previous review) except for about 15 seconds  oddly enough  I guess they were reallllllly into the Pink Floyd song they were playing and wanted us all to enjoy it  too lolPrices: A bit high considering the amount of food you get    Still worth it  though I will surely be back next time Im in town :),?
1244701,Food: ordered the Hokkaido style Chashu! It was delicious! The meat was tender and marinated well! The corn was included in the ramen  and it wasnt as much as I hoped for  The bowls are huge and you dont realize how much ramen you have until you see theres more in the bottom of the bowl  Service: I would have to say this is probably the best service I have received at any ramen place  They are all really friendly and timely  Environment: bigger than most ramen places and a lot more spacious! Etc: They also take reservations which is pretty cool :) Oh and a free small scoop for dessert!,?
1245102,Foods decent but these fucktards charge a $1 for straight out of a bag  mixed in a bucket ranch  Huh? After charging premium summerlin rates for everything on the menu (including $2$4 for toppings) they want to hit me with a $1 for ketchups distant cousin??? I guess that keeps out the riff raff  That said  the meatballs are good  So there ,?
1245260,Foods not bad  but they have a bad habit of panicking about lines and making stuff early   When they turn around and grab your chicken nuggets off the rack behind them as you order it is a bad sign   I now check the temp before leaving the counter   Im hoping they get the idea eventually   Today they had no cashier at the front  because she was on the drive through and I stood there saying uh hello? for awhile despite seeing a guy cleaning and another in the back   Working as a team and covering for each other is not a strong suit here      Ive actually walked out of here for this before    The language skills are really dropping though  the woman got grumpy at me for putting my hand on the card while waiting for it to process and said leave card  need to wait   Theyre actually getting worse over time   Its a shame too as this is so convenient when you get the blue to Bernard terminal buys and need to get a connecting bus ,?
1245649,For $10  course is a steal (Im a card member) Some dry and wet areas but thats what you get    Pro shop staff was great  girls in the bar were great  on course ranger was great but the starter came over and told us not to play the back tees as those are reserved for 6 handicap or lower  I guess because a few of our first shots were a bit bad (6am start and we were barely away)   Anyways  2 of our foresome broke 80  1 we lost track and I shot a 68 (yes I know its a par72)  So Id give a 5 star but I guess we got judged on not having our golf shirts tucked in    Play here  its worth the money and a long tough course ,?
1248177,For a chain to be so understaffed during the day  and to not even clean up after other guests is beyond me  Open seating outside 7 open tables  non clean to sit on  I have had bad service here before but always said maybe someone called in sick  or they are running behind or someone is having a bad day  But today was the last draw for us  No excuse for how dirty this place is  Tables sticky not clean  and for us not have anyone come to us for 10 min to get a drink order it crazy  Hire a better staff  or train them better  Food is still great for what you get but cant believe the management is not on top of this stuff ,?
1248209,For a chain  this is awesome  It gets an extra star for having organic ingridients and a friendly  young crew who really are on top of their customer service  We had tacos  They were not the juiciest ive had  but there were so many salsa options it made up for that  I liked the fish  but was not a fan of the cauliflower and broccoli  I would come back again ,?
1250000,For a place with Sushi in its name  the sushi was disappointing   Rolls only  no nigiri  no sashimi  no custom orders   The noodle dishes were OK ,?
1250553,For a small diner  the food is surprisingly good!!My favourites include the chicken shawarma wrap  Greek salad  and fish and chips  They do have daily sandwich specials  however I havent tried them yet  The owner is always friendly and efficient  Most importantly the food is inexpensive  delicious and the portions generous  Im so glad I discovered this place its easy to pass by it without a second thought  Its my goto when I dont have the energy to make supper but want a cheap and comforting meal ,?
1250720,For a spot specialized in yakitori I expected much more compelling grilled meat  At 23$ a pop  each skewer features a tiny amount of meat in some depressingly generic soy based seasoning  The chicken brown meat was good but lets be honest  even the worst cooks cant screw that up  On top of that: clunky service  mushy rice  incredibly hard to chew beef tongue and dry lamb meat I was tempted to try many more menu items with a second order round but after realizing the first 30$ spent gave us no satisfaction we decided to bounce ,?
1252445,For anyone who would love to explore a house with secret doors  search for hidden clues and with the urgency or needing to escape  this is for you  Had so much fun working as a team to discover the secrets of the basement and move closer toward our escape  We did not quite make it out however we got pretty far  I cant wait to go back and try again and try out the study ,?
1252948,For being in a little Parma Heights plaza  Pounders isnt bad They have great drink/food specials  HUGE selection of wing flavorsDecent staffDecent TV set  up (although many of them are smaller than youd want)Overall  not a bad little bar   Next time I really want to try the Bourbon Meyer wing sauce flavor ,?
1253427,For dim sum downtown  it is a decent choice  far better than Bright Pearl across the street  This is our default choice for Sunday mornings  because of course we cant afford Lai Wah Heen  Everything tastes like it should for Cantonese dim sum; not better and not worse For nondim sum  I am a bit baffled by the raves this place gets by my coworkers  who admittedly may be more into ChineseCanadian than Chinese  Much better Chinese food can be had a few doors north at New Sky  Im not sure if they are open to serve the postbar crowd however ,?
1253660,For fast food Swensons is probably as good as it gets  The waiting staff that greets you in your car are EXTREMELY attentive and certainly get our food out as fast as humanly possible( they run from car to car!) The burgers are surprisingly not greasy and their homemade milkshakes are one of a kind ,?
1253695,For fast food pizza Sbarros in Superstition Springs mall is by far the best  They have an amazing mushroom pizza and Simon behind the counter always has a smile on his face! I come here about once a week and have never been disappointed  This place is great!,?
1254028,For having the word coat in the store name  there was a surprisingly small amount of actual coats here   Despite that fact  I did manage to find a decent winter coat that didnt cost me an arm and a leg ,?
1254694,For me the breakfast was ok  We were staying out by the airport for a couple of night and decided to check this place out  The servings were smaller compared to other places in the area  That part was fine but there wasnt a lot of flavor to me  None of us finished our meals and it wasnt because of the portions ,?
1255399,For my 30th birthday my husband surprised me with a trip to Vegas! Both of us LOVE the outdoors! Naturally my only request is that we go on an adventure at Red Rock Canyons and play around in the mountains  We found Pink Jeep Tours online and boy am I glad we chose them over any of the other companies out there  Pink Jeep gives 5 star service! They are extremely fun  knowledgable and all around a great company! Jesse was our guide and had so many great stories to share with our group  we even got to go off roading higher in the mountains  which apparently pink jeep is the only company allowed I do that so it was truly a one of a kind experience! This will ALWAYS be on our list of stops when we come back to Vegas and I will be sure to share with all my friends and family! Thanks u Pink Jeep and Jesse for creating such a memorable birthday adventure!,?
1257085,For ramen in Cleveland  this is pretty good  Would not say its at the level of some of the other ramen shops Ive been to on the coasts Almost always go with the #1 Charsiu  Broth is good as are noodles  Egg is often over cooked however  Still a great place to grab ramen in Cleveland ,?
1257656,For some reason our visitors from out of town want to head to Mon Ami  I only oblige them cuz I am a good host and I am a sucker for the view while sitting on the sidewalk  Other than the view  I just dont see it  Mediocre food to give it a compliment  As a steak house   there are over a hundred mo betta in Sin City ,?
1258336,For spur of the moment this was an okay  We had the soft shell crab app and it was underwhelming as was the garlic bread  The fries and chicken basket was the best thing but a bit over priced for being in Summerlin  from my perspective  The caesar salad was a bit over dressed but about average  Overall it was all meh ,?
1258340,For stars for what you get   Its a good beer and burger joint   Great for kids or happy hour   Hopefully their location wont be their downfall ,?
1258882,For sure not impressed with the decor but the tacos and beer are great! Taco Tuesday is awesome and great options and combos of flavors  I was a bit skeptical of the place when we first drove up but the food was so tasty Im for sure going back  Great beer/food with excellent prices ,?
1260274,For the love of all that is holy  please stop discontinuing what folks actually buy  In addition  please be a proud Wisconsin store and carry at least one good cheese  This store has turned into a blight on mcfarland   You cannot consistently get the same brand of a product week to week  and the 16 year old help is sorely misguided and confused We have started shopping out of town,?
1263345,For those of you having trouble finding the place on the map like me  its in the central food court area  right next to the Cinnabon  Maps should have a numbering system  not its one of these 30 purple dots! Decent steak sandwich  Nice ambience  Service felt slower than it may have been  Recommended if youve got time and an expense account  otherwise you may want to start somewhere else  Assuming you can find it ,?
1264078,For under $20  DeliveryDragon and Phoenix (chicken/shrimp & veggies) like kung pao!!!   crab angels and spring roll  Delish ,?
1264426,For what it is  it works  Cheap beers  nice barkeeps  and interesting clientele  Kinda feel like you might be in a Coen bros  film when you drink here  Pool and darts and an old jukebox wailing in the back  Cash only ,?
1265436,Forensic science and crime shows are my favorite things in the world and I was excited to come here  I was however slightly disappointed  If you go  ask them to match the groupon price of 2 cases for $30 rather than 1 for $31  You get assigned cases and its cool to see all the labs  etc but the whole thing is straight forward and you dont really need to have any skill to crack the case  I get that its just a game or whatever but they should make some cases hard and some easy for people of different levels  It was cool but I probably wouldnt go back  Photo booth thing was cool tho  Staff was nice here too ,?
1265832,Forget having them greet you like a human being  These people are the rudest bunch of aholes on the other side of the nut house  I know the manager can get on the speaker for drive theu  but he doesnt have to be so damn rude to his customers  I ordered a plain bagel with cream cheese  He asked me a question and I didnt understand him the first time  I said  No  a bagel with cream cheese  He said I got that the first time  maam  I asked you wanted the bagel TOASTED  He was very loud that time and completely obnoxious  1) Dont be condescending towards customers and 2) Put a frigging smile on your face and be happy its Friday  And to the other employees there: dont be like your manager  Find a place that actually makes you happy to be at work P S  I wont ever back  Good luck being rude to your customers ,?
1265875,Forget standing in line at the Post Office  I highly recommend this store! Fast  Friendly and Convenient!!,?
1266398,Forgot to review this spot on our last visit but wanted to make sure I gave them praise!! Love their salads at lunch and the dinner offerings are super yummy! Very thoughtful food and they take great pride in plating! Kind of loud inside but worth it! So wether your at the bar sitting for a nice light lunch or dining in a table you will enjoy this spot!  And its not anywhere near the strip so you get a great price for quality foods!,?
1267793,Found a excellent replacement for getting your repairs and maintenance done other than the dealership! Turns out this place was opened by a former Mercedes technician  Great treatment and did what appears to be a great B service for almost 1/2 the price the dealers just south of here were going to charge! Plus my advisor is no longer there  So I started using his partner and NOW hes no longer there! Now I hear that Penske bought the place! You can be sure the prices will be going up even higher then they already were  Employees leaving and now new owners   Somethings up  Im GRATEFUL I found Zach at his new place! And by the looks of things down the street  JUST IN TIME!,?
1267940,Found a hair on my order  Got an apology but guess it wasnt a rare enough occurrence  for them to comp the order    Too bad  the place showed promise ,?
1268139,Found a really good deal online for $104/night for the King Edgewater room  which made this option cheaper than other lowertiered hotels in a similar location   Location is great  right by the water and walking distance to the Capitol   Overall  this is a good hotel that you could spend your whole day at if theres a blizzard out or if you are feeling lazy to venture out   You can find a nice corner with a lakeview to read a book  relax in their jacuzzi pool  get a workout  eat in the restaurant  or grab drinks in their bar  all possible without having to brave the outdoor cold!  All staff were friendly and courteous ,?
1268238,Found an app for breweries  and I was surprised this was so close to work  Cool! Its an old garage that has been converted to a brewpub  I walked in and I could smell they just brewed that day  I LOVE THAT AROMA!!I sat at the bar and waited a minute or two and the bartender asked me what I will have  I asked for a food menu and she obliged  I saw they had an extensive cheese menu  cool I thought  I got a beer and it was average  I ordered a cheese platter and another beer that would fit the profile  I must say  this is the first experience that a brewpub had such a cheese list  I was happy  However the beer is just average  I got to pale ales  hopped differently  They need some brown ales and some lighter beers to fit the cheese menu  All in all  I will definitely be back  I hope they can improve the beer Edited Review: I have stopped in here since then & unfortunately their beers havent changed much  Same malt base  different hops  I dropped it one star for that fact ,?
1270276,Found this gem of a holeinthewall on maps app looking for more selection of eats  Looking at the reviews many have said that it was the best restaurant in the Champaign Urbana area  What I liked was that the food  even though it was Jamaican cuisine  was pretty close to food from home since my roots are Dominican/Puerto Rican  Had the Jerk Chicken meal which was dark meat Jerk Chicken with rice and beans and sweet plantains  Ordered it as take out  The food was delicious  Very wholesome  Definitely felt great eating some sweet plantains since the flavor hits so close to home  The extra jerk sauce gave the meal an extra kick with lots of flavor  Really enjoyed the food in this establishment  My only request is that thy should serve oxtail a little more often than once a week  It was something that I was craving but didnt have it the day I went ,?
1270447,Found this gem while staying at a nearby resort   Great pizza and even better service ,?
1271563,Found this place by accident this past weekend and decided to give it a try with their buy one get one free coupon   Got the French dip & bacon blue cheeseburger & fries  Both were good 4/5 Id say (could use more fries but still good) plenty of seating inside & out with TVs and couches to sit at outside   Had GREAT service from Whitney (which is also gorgeous)  Took care of us really well  Decent prices  Plenty of parking  Clean in & out  Will be back!!  Good job!!,?
1272097,Found this place on Google  they had decent reviews  When I got here I was a little surprised to see that it is actually a shack  The bathroom smell terrible along with this service   I asked to sample the wing flavors before I ordered and I was told you can only sample three  I ended up only trying the hot and mango habanero which were not bad  but decent  I oredered 9 wings and a side of fries the price came out to about $12 and some change  Good price I would say  I ordered my wings extra crispy; all flats  The wings are not very saucey when you get the actually dry  I dont like my wings tasting fatty  but they did  I had to pay an additional $ 81 for a side of sauce because my wings are dry  The fries  hmmm I would pass the taste like the fries you can cook at home  Overall  I will not recommend this place I would say stick to Wingstop!,?
1272127,Found this place on Idine and tried it for lunch  Very nice place with a very large bar  On the high end side if that is what you are looking for  Food was excellent and service was very good  I had the linguine with chicken and mushrooms in a cream sauce with a glass of white wine  They brought over some good crusty French bread and I had a wonderful food experience  What I also liked was that the menu was overloaded  You have enough to pick from but not too much so you know the chef can do everything properly and fresh  Will go back for dinner soon ,?
1272256,Found this place on Yelp and glad we did  Great beer selection  the sandwiches are wonderful and huge  wings were very good  Family owned establishment and everyone we met was great  the owner  waitstaff and kitchen staff   If we ever get to The Pittsburgh area again  we will go back!,?
1273118,Found this place on yelp Great customer service and knowledge of indoor plants ,?
1273166,Found this place on yelp  The food is amazing ! The carne asada tasted so good and the beans were the best that I have in some time  We will be back to this place for sure!,?
1273262,Found this place randomly on Yelp   It was late night  the guy working was super nice  and food turned out super delish!  Nicely tucked away at the end of the strip  Great for late night eats ,?
1273307,Found this place soon after moving to Phoenix  Not really a dive bar due to cleanliness and prices but more of a speakeasy vibe  Met some really nice and cool people which is mostly what keeps us going back  Pool table and a legendary old school jukebox ,?
1274431,Found this when going down to visit the newly remodled Plaza Hotel downtown  The sushi was excellent  staff friendly and prices reasonable  As a bonus  they even offer a discount to L V  locals on certain nights    thats always appreciated  Anyway  definately one of my favorite sushi spots in Vegas ,?
1275385,Four of us visited Sin City last night for a take out whilst we are visiting Las Vegas The food was freshly prepared and the owner kept us up to date on what he was doing with the place as he had only been open for three weeks The owner is in the process of smartening the interior up and Im sure with his high standards once this is achieved it will be worthy of 5*  We had chicken wings  soup  sweet and sour chicken  garlic chicken and teriyaki chicken All the food was excellent and we couldnt fault anything  If we lived in Las Vegas Im certain this would be one of our go to spots for good food whether it be eat in or take out,?
1275589,Four of us wild and crazy gals decided to try Axe Monkeys while in Vegas recently   Three of us had never done any axe throwing before   We had so much fun   From the beginning to the end Allan took great care of us!  He explained everything  took pictures  came back to show us different throws and made sure we were happy with our experience   I would definitely go back again!  Something different that was challenging  yet fun!!,?
1275770,Four stars because I almost always leave with a great cut and a solid experience  Jenna cut my hair tonight and she did a killer job  didnt talk more than I wanted her to  firm shampoo  shaved my neck and then gave me a quick back/neck massage  which was enough  I tried a shave once Nd found that it wasnt closer than a regular shave  but the experience was incredible  Extremely relaxing  more so than some actual massages Ive had ,?
1275806,Four stars because of the fact that this Starbucks is open on weekends  when nothing else nearby is open  I occasionally work weekends in this area  and this is a godsend Other than that  pretty standard Starbucks  The lineups can be long as its inside an office building  but it moves fast and the service is pretty friendly ,?
1276642,Fourth time down here in this area  Always busy and full of energy  Full of restaurants  and easy access to casinos  Would recommend for window shopping  and just to take in the energy  The High Roller is at the end if you want to partake  If you are in the area  would recommend to walk through ,?
1276702,Fourthing what everyone has said so far  its a little hard to find  but worth it! Ive only gotten the kimbap  but its made to order  fresh  and one very massive roll for $3 50  Service is friendly as well  Overall  a solid togo spot  especially for an afternoon snack or light lunch ,?
1277336,Frank and Anna are super fair and super great work for me  I am a repeat customer and recommend them to anyone looking for superior work at a great price!!,?
1278383,Freaking fantastic  I loved  loved the greek french fries  The best fries outside of Canada  (And if you have never eaten in Canada you need to go and try any restaurant there )A young man helped me out  should have asked his name  He was very polite and brought me water after I told him no thank you  I did appreciate his thoughtfulness after the fact Sorry for not taking a picture  The food looked and tasted so delish I just started eating  ;)Honestly I wish more restaurants served crispy non greasy fried food  I have no idea how they made everything on my plate taste so good  just happy they did If you havent been here yet you need to go  its worth the trip ,?
1278511,Fred & company have the secret recipe for the best damn Greek food in the valley  Sometimes there is a bit of a wait  order early for delivery  but that is because more and more people are finding out about this diamond in a strip mall  Everything is always tasty  fresh and homemade! You cannot go wrong with anything you order here but I recommend the Zeus (no falafel)  Also the baklava is AMAZING! Run there and try it     but if you see me coming  let me skip ahead in the line because I dont really want to wait for you ,?
1279067,Free beer with the yelp review!! Score!! Our server is polite and informative  this will be a definite come back spot for me,?
1279473,Free rotations every 5k miles  The tire prices seem higher than other stores but keep in mind that maintenance is basically free when you go with Discount Tire so long as the tires you purchased are from Discount Tire  Also  fun fact  this is the corporate Discount Tire location  So  youre not getting jipped here and the staff has to uphold their standards to the highest possible ,?
1279592,Free vacuums  convenient location  good monthly prices  I just wish I can tip the people that guide me in and do the prewash,?
1279924,Freiburg has an interesting ambience  very nicely done Germanic decor  Several large tables are available for bigger parties I was there for brunch/lunch  their menu for that time of the day doesnt seem too specialized  as a German gastropub  We tried the potato cakes  with lox and poached eggs  which was a horrible choice  The cakes are simply hashbrowns  no flavor what so ever  and they couldnt even poach an egg  They were fully cooked  The lox was chewy and disappointing  If I had only had this $12 50 dish  I would have given it 1/2 star However  their Apple pancakes with Bavarian cream was decent  It was moist  creamy and more so Germanic I suppose  The redeeming dish though  really was the stuffed kohlrabi with oyster mushrooms and barley  It was a very interesting and well done dish that had certain eastern European essences  So in all  they have a lot of work to do  Change up their halfA menu and get serious about the German food that they are trying to provide ,?
1280219,French music festival in the heart of downtown  with a variety of free shows to meet most tastes  I try to go every year to check it out  For two weeks  there is at least one free concert from 5pm until midnight at place des arts that you can enjoy  Plus there are some paid concerts as well to see additional stars of French music  Its one of the first big festivals that kick off the summer season in Montreal ,?
1280474,Frequent this plaza regularly but have never ate here until today  Surprisingly delicious  Got the beef and tripe noodle soup  My only complaint is that they ran out of the thin rice noodles and I was given glass noodles instead  Not the same experience  The broth was sweet and flavourful  not oily at all  The meats were so tender  Definitely a winner  I just wish I was hungrier so I could order some of the good looking appetizers! Hopefully next time they wont be out of the regular noodles!,?
1281287,Fresh and tasty Libanese sandwiches  salads  warm dishes  baklava  etc  Its a great place to get a lunch to go (they have prepacked items if you are in a rush  but its not that long either for them to prepare you a sandwich)   I have always been able to find a place to sit down and eat there  even there are not that many tables  Staff is really nice  Its a spot that I visit on a regular basis  just about every week  and they always have a decent number of customers  which is a good sign  too!,?
1281563,Fresh concept  very earthy cute decor  Pricey to eat healthy but you get what you pay for! Got the vegan poke bowl and Mother Earth to go  $29 for lunch! Will dine in next time in town to enjoy the full experience ,?
1282993,Fresh smoking hot pita  tasty lamb  garlic sauce that they should bottle  kebabs & lamb were absolutely fantastic!  Couple that w wonderful service & this is one of our new go to places ,?
1283278,Fresh!  Delicious! Donuts are amazing  Pizza is out of this world  A familyowned business that truly cares for its customers ,?
1284084,Freshest boba  They make it right in front of you  Awesome staff too! They have so many countless options of boba and smoothies  And the food is quite yummy  My favorite is the taro boba smoothie and the passion fruit mango mix  They have a avocado one made with actual avocados pretty yummy ,?
1285268,Friday night  pizza and a salad wow  Absolutely awesome  as described in other reviews soft  chewy  buttery crust with an abundance of toppings   Hunks of real sausage and a slightly sweet sauce  The antipasta salad with house dressing outstanding  Fresh made with thick cuts of ham and salami  with plenty of other fresh toppings ,?
1285370,Friday was a bad day    started off with an indifferent waiter who wiped down our booth w / a wet towel ( and left it wet )      my wife & I dried up his mess with some napkins on the table  Waited another 10 min  while watching him wander all over the restaurant     asked someone behind the bar if anyone was working the floor    she looked puzzled and when to find him     thats when we left     this is another example of a new restaurant opening w / untrained staff       Today ( Sun  )    had a very productive talk w / the GM  who assured us the problem will be taken care of     well be back ( sorry Arnold ! )     ,?
1285780,Fried chicken was good (not great)  but the sides were horrible I would have rather have went to a KFC  They forgot to give us the bread so I had to ask them  but it was pretty bad  Besides for their decent chicken nothing else impressed me here ,?
1286992,Friendly and chill vibe  playing a nice mix of 80s to now music  7 chair/tables with a couch and stuffed chairs to spend time with your peeps  Inner Circle is on Scottsdale South of Thomas on the East side in the mall with Hot Yoga University and AZ wine  across from Pep Boys  We came in for a relaxing moment and coffee with my small people on a Friday late morning  Sue greets you with a warm smile and a menu  The menu hits all the highs with satisfying and tantalizing sandwiches and salads  See the yummy avocado toast I noshed on today  My kids enjoyed the nutella banana toast  The got on it pretty fast so no pic there  I appreciate supporting my friend and her dreams  Please do the same  you wont be disappointed,?
1287753,Friendly atmosphere and waitstaff  Happy hour apps are a great value  Happy Hour drink prices are only ok  Try the crispy calamari   its excellent!,?
1288028,Friendly customer service and clean beds  Many different beds to choose from  They offer points packages that can be applied to any tanning bed or spray tan without the commitment of autopay or monthly plans ,?
1288234,Friendly faces  delicious falafel and lentil soup  super spicy sauce packs a punch without overwhelming other flavors!,?
1288314,Friendly folks  but not helpful in our circumstance  We had a technician come out twice for the same problem  our bathroom wall sconce lights would intermittently turn off when they should be on  We were told it was because they just needed smaller watt bulbs  We couldnt find those bulbs so the technician came out and replaced them for us    and the lights are still turning off  When I called to discuss my dissatisfaction with having 2 appointments without success the response was Im sorry  Have a nice day  There was no attempt to remedy the situation by offering a different tech with perhaps even a discount for our trouble  Unfortunate customer service experience and lack of adequate knowledge to fix the problem in this particular case ,?
1289481,Friendly service and tasty food in just the right portion size for lunch ,?
1290116,Friendly service  nice variety of specials  clean and we only waited 2 minutes   Highly recommended!!,?
1291365,Friendly staff at this Junction neighbourhood business  Great product and they really care about getting the order perfect and on time  There is a sign out front at Lavishey  but their entrance through the rear lane way  walk around Crema  I get custom buttons but the sell the makers and supplies too ,?

1292907,Friendly staff  relaxed place  indoor and outdoor seating  Loved the crepes and Italian sodas ,?
1293844,Friendly workers  nice atmosphere  and I love their milk tea boba  I usually order the taro milk tea and I love it  There are a lot of fresh flavors and they use real fruit ,?
1294010,Friendly  clean  and private  Im NEVER going back to Belle Reflexology again  This place is better   and they dont charge extra for oil and hot towel  Be expected to tip 20%  which is fine  considering the quality and price of service ,?
1294428,Friendly  honest  good selection ,?
1294504,Friendly  knowledgeable  honest  skilled  & they guarantee their work I would recommend them & return for service ,?
1294903,Friends and I enjoyed this place  Great view of the back kitchen where the staff is busy making all the baked goods  The line looked long  but is was maybe less then a 25 min wait  The only issue was that the Rugelach was too dense ,?
1295056,Friends brought Jimmy Johns box of little sandwiches (whatever you call that choice) to a Chrismtas party   It was amazing   The subs went faster than the deviled eggs   They tasted great and were so easy for my friends (She hates cooking!)  Will definitely remember that the next time Im invited to a party and need to bring a dish to pass,?
1295160,Friends in AZ kept telling me about this spot so we finally got to try it  I love Vietnamese sandwhiches so you understand why it was a must try Final analysis  very good  My son even liked it and hes not really into Vietnamese sandwhiches  He had the one with a fried egg  I tried a bite and it definitely added a new taste to the sandwhich  I had the special combo and truly enjoyed it  The bread is different from most Vietnamese sandwiches baguettes  softer and very tasty when served hot ,?
1295458,Fries and Mac and cheese here are delicious  Chicken tenders are good and nachos were not bad  The big chunks of chicken in the nachos were a bit strange  but everything else about the nachos was good  I like that its more of a fast food style kind of thing  It did take a bit long to get the food  but everything I ate there was tasty I went there 2 days in a row so I guess that says something ,?
1295487,Fries are cold everytime  our pretzel was terrifying it was so covered in salt we couldnt even eat it  Our server got it taken off and was very kind  But bww food consistency is way off  Wont be back,?
1295997,From 46 PM every single day of the week  you can go and forget that bitch  Lady Luck  totally ditched you at the baggage carousel  that you lost this months mortgage at the Craps table  and that the hot slot machine you sat with for so long was nothing but a tease  Because from 46 every day at Sushi Roku  you can pretend that youre a high roller  order a large Kirin beer  a spicy tuna roll  a shrimp tempura and jalapeno roll  an order of spicy prawns and chips  and a mini chocolate volcano cake off the Happy Hour menu  And when you get the bill thats less than $20  you can feel like youve just hit the progressive jackpot  Except that you are still leaving with an even lighter wallet  But at least you dont have to worry about paying that pesky winnings tax ,?
1296233,From Columbus and stopped in for local pizza  Pep and sausage was incredible  Sausage is true Italian with plenty on spice,?
1297412,From making an appointment to service completion  this is a great company to choose  I have about the worst carpet on earth and I currently cannot afford to replace it  I also have a wonderful dog that I love so much       and he loves the corner of just about every piece of furniture I have!My tech was Phil  Friendly  professional  and great with the dogs!  He did everything he could to get my carpet looking as clean as it could get   Afterward  I felt a sigh of relief looking at the carpet  smelling how fresh and clean it is now  especially compared to what it had been!Thank you Phil and Brimleys!,?
1297564,From my first step into this place was amazing great service funny great food great allaround I recommend this to everybody,?
1298439,From start to finish  excellent experience   Accurate overthephone pricing  once I made the appointment  they followed up with confirming email  and then the day of  they called 30 minutes in advance and showed up exactly when scheduled   Robert  the tech  was a super nice guy and he went in and worked his magic and all the hills and dales in my guestroom *poof*were gone!  COR Movers was recommended to move the furniture in and out and they too were reasonably priced and really nice guysthey even helped me remake the bed  and everyone knows what a bear it is to get a bedskirt on all by yourself I will definitely use them again and am happy to recommend   The restretching of the carpet will give us many more years of use in an infrequently used room I also understand from Yelps that they are wizards at carpetcleaning as well!,?
1299115,From the first phone conversation with Michelle (friendly and caring) to Atul (friendly professional and knowledgeable)  what a great team!Thank you so much!  Who knew I have been dealing with all these problems for way too long and you all figured it out  a bad router (okay and a few viruses)!!Thanks again!!Deb  your new fan!,?
1299641,From the moment Cleve greeted me at the door my anxiety level went down and I knew I could trust him  hes a very honest and fair business man   If youre getting rid of old jewelry I recommend stopping by his shop first!!!!!,?
1300208,From the moment we walked in they greeted us  They were very friendly and explained their menu  We got 2 burgers and the animal fries  Let me tell you they were cooked perfectly! The bread was soft the bacon thick and juicy! I would definitely come back again  Also we had service we havent received in years! They constantly were checking on us  I would give them 10 stars if I could!,?
1300257,From the moment we walked in  we experienced awful service  The waitress ignored us  finally sat us down  dumped a couple of menus on us and walked off  When we ordered coffee  my wife asked if they had soy milk and she abruptly barked  No and walked off again  We left immediately and let her know why  Try Creme de la Creme down the street instead If you make customers feel like theyre inconveniencing you  then youre not going to have much luck in this game ,?
1300346,From the moment you enter the shopYou feel welcomed  So far we have only had the pleasure of meeting John and he has taken the timeTo answer any questions we have regarding his bakery goods and makes sure that our coffee is made to our liking  The coffee  if staying in  is served in actual cups and is not watered down at all  He serves a wonderfully roasted Ethiopian coffee and uses only the freshest ingredients  The desserts    my mouth waters just thinking about them all  I am gluten free and they offer a melt in your mouth flourless chocolate cake  They also have tons of other gluten free options ,?
1300998,From the outside  this place looks like it would be tiny because the plaza is a bit of a ghost town  When I walked inside the waiting area  I felt like my suspicion was confirmed  The hostess offered for us to wait at their bar (all I remember thinking was how how a place so small could possibly fit a bar)  and that was when I found that they do have ample space in the restaurant  The food we ordered for the most part were all good  but two notable dishes that pushed me to give 5 stars instead of 4 were the catfish salad and the garlic prawns ,?
1301426,From the start of our experience with Window Nation  my wife and I have been nothing but satisfied  Steve in sales did everything he could to get us the best product and to fit our budget  The installation appointment was easy to make  The installers were professional  kind  and diligent  finishing ahead of schedule  Support and follow up both during and after our install was more than I expected  Its been less than a week since our install  but so far  were happy  What more can we ask for!,?
1302139,Fromagerie Hamel is a serious institution in cheese that has been serving Montreals cheese loving population for over 60 years!  What you have here is a strong selection of any kind of cheese to serve your liking!  Also a fine selection of cured sausages  oils  jams  cookies  chocolate and most of the finer and rich things you need to find to compliment a meal or snack   What I have found here however is the cafe caps reuseable caps for a Nespresso machine   Location is right adjacent to MarcheJean Talon   A great place to come for your cheese or fine food fixing!,?
1304149,Full credit because they make specific provision for the wheatsensitive  vegan  and vegetarian clientele  Its a real challenge to find tasty Asian offerings for a vegan celiac  but we found a couple of pretty tasty alternatives  They use a separate wok  nonwheat soy sauce  and rice noodles for those particular needs  Yay!,?
1304312,Full disclosure  I usually dont like shops like this  My wife walks through  and I follow closely behind hoping we leave soon  Not a shopper  Fair Trade was the complete opposite  They sell things from 34 different countries and other local artists  We didnt buy anything  but it was so cool to look at it all  The owner was super nice and enthusiastic and loved telling us the story behind each of the countries pieces  The metal wall decor was from Haiti and was hand beaten into shape from used oil drums  The leaf lamps were from the Philippines and used real leaves and she explained the process  Its kind of like going to a museum  I love the idea of local places like this  Everything here has a story  and isnt mass produced in China like if you go to Hobby Lobby ,?
1304565,Full disclosure: Im not a big fan of Mexican in general beyond tacos that I cook myself at home  That said  this place is pretty great  Price is reasonable for the mountain of food you get with most meals  and the service has always been friendly and fairly prompt when Ive eaten here  Ive only ever been for dinner  so one of these days I need to do the lunch test and see if its doable in a typical lunch hour or not  For the one or two times a year that I am in the mood for Mexican  I go with Azteca!,?
1304692,Full of Bull !!! This restaurant has a KOBE Burger on its menu  However   my uncle is the Sole Kobe Beef importer for the Entire United States and to date there are only 9 restaurants that carry KOBE Beef   two are in Las Vegas  AND this is not one of them   In addition NO KOBE BEEF is sold boneless  SHAME ON YOU,?
1305791,Fun atmosphere  great drinks  decent food! Live music is always a plus  Get there before the crowd does or youll be waiting awhile ,?
1305842,Fun atmosphere  standard food  We ordered a lot of food to taste everything and it was ok   good enough for bar food but not if youre a foodie  Kids love it of course! There are tons of games to keep them entertained  I would go again to keep the kids entertained but not for the food/drinks ,?
1306382,Fun during the winter as they have a mock ice skating rink  Great restaurants  movie theater  bars and even a Dave and Busters ,?
1306678,Fun food thats as delightful to look at as it is to eat  The size of the dishes are perfect for ordering a ton to share so that you can have a little of everything  my favourite way to dine  My favourite dishes are the soft shell crab bao  the steamed vegetable dumplings  the cucumber salad  the spare ribs and the duck rolls  And of course  the ambiance is gorgeous  warm  inviting  and whimsical  Amazing addition to the Plateau!,?
1307090,Fun little joint for lunch or dinner in downtown Fort Mill   Absolutely wonderful that all items are local and/or organic   I recently had the Fish PoBoy   Very tasty   I encourage you to try it out when driving through Fort Mill   I just hope this starts a trend of local restaurants in the downtown area ,?
1307351,Fun music  amazing bar tenders throwing tricks  Dont blink! This place is so much fun!,?
1308030,Fun place to go for chicken wings   Wings are good  about 100 flavors to choose from   The Oshawa location is bigger than the one in Whitby   Be sure to try the GarPar wings ,?
1308330,Fun place to shop and visit  You never know what youre going to find   On our first visit  I found what I had been seeking for some timea Budweiser belt buckle  Yes!!!I admire their no greed and humane breakage policy  too   Its a smallish store but wellkept and organized  They have nice benches out front to enjoy the sun  a sandwich stop nextdoor  a massage shop and a coffee/tea shop right around the corner   Definitely worth a stop and supporting  Five Yelp stars  all the way See you there! Update06/20/16Stopped by today and the shop is no longer in that space  There was no indication of reopening there or at any other location Update6/22/16I hear of a pending reopening on Atwood Ave  Wishing the best for them!,?
1308383,Fun place to take kids   Or a friend u really dont like   But u feed them with a long spoon  lol but naw kewl    Place check it out my yelpers,?
1308895,Fun place   Friendly staff and well run   However  the toy vending machines in back take the kids dollars and dont vend any toys   When I questioned the staff at the front desk she said she couldnt do anything about it and that the machines do that all the time  So  my Granddaughter was just out her dollar  Thats not good business!,?
1310236,Fun  lively atmosphere! Amazing cocktails  meatloaf and burgers  Best meal while in Pittsburgh and I had some good meals!!,?
1311050,Funny thing is there is one in my city  but never had the chance to go   I ordered the turkey burger that came with a salad and the meat patty was thick   We also ordered a sampler of fried onion rings fried zucchini  and fried sweet and spicy pickle chips   Our waiter gave great customer service   We substituted one of our kids fruit for fries  and he did it right away as the food was coming out   Although they forgot my ice tea  he offered to either take if off the bill or to go and apologized   Overall  it was a very good experience ,?
1311231,Furnishings  shower and bed were great   Refrigerator making noise all the time and red light in my window not so great ,?
1312019,GET THE CRAB RANGOONS!!!! They have the best crab rangoons Ive ever eaten  I would totally recommend  The other food is great too!!!,?
1312520,GO Knights GO!! Fun place to watch the game with friends and have a few drinks!! Our bartender was friendly and outgoing! Drinks came on a timely manner  We came during happy hour  as well  Place was crowded but theres always seats ,?
1312711,GOGI is by far the best Korean restaurant that I have been to in Arizona  I am a regular here and just cant get enough of the delicousness this place has to offer    Their bibimbap is better than any other place that I have been to and the pork belly is perfection every single time   Just when I thought my meal couldnt get any better I heard our server say these magic words Here is our steamed egg on the house   I havent found a Korean place that serves this amazing side dish and I almost couldnt believe my ears  I enjoyed every single bite of that fluffy flavorful egg   I highly recommend GOGI to anyone!  Give them a chance to convince you that their Korean food is the best!,?
1313359,GREAT FOOD  POOR SERVICEI want to like Windup Bird   And in fact the food is excellent    However two weekends in a row I have tried doing a late brunch in the afternoon  sat down in plain view  and been ignored for ten minutes   No menu  no coffee  no nothing   It seems the cook is experienced  but hamstrung with a serving staff transplanted from another industry entirely  Last week I waited it out and enjoyed an excellent breakfast  Like I said  kitchen is great   But the wait was annoying  This week I pulled the plug at the 10 minute mark and am down the street enjoying brunch at Kaplannskis   Had coffee and a menu within one minute of sitting   And they are equally busy   (75% full )  Its not rocket science  folks ,?
1313600,GREAT PLACE!! GREAT SERVICES!! I loved the oysters nice and fresh  Its a great place with great view of the boardwalk  They have outside tables ,?
1313813,GREAT TACOS !!!!! if  youve never been here  you need to give them a try   Best freaken tacos around  mmm the mula de adobada is the bomb  i work down the street from this place and wow do they get busy for lunch   Just wish their drive thru would be in service for a faster in n out    : ) oh yeah and their hours are great  open late pa todos los q andan de party and want to get a bite to eat  this is the spot ,?
1313892,GREAT beer but I think the food is over priced  It is absolutey beautiful and at least go one time to experence the total uniqueness of the place :),?
1314278,GREAT meal  Was a party of six and they sat us alone  outside  under the tent The seating was a bit odd  especially given the fact the restaurant was only half full  Putting that aside  the server was great  and food outstanding The Chicken Tortilla soup was great  as were the fish tacos  HIGHLY RECOMMEND ,?
1314695,GREATEST TACOS EVERRRR! waited 2 hours for a table and let me say it was soooooo worth it  We started out with the chorizo queso blanco  to die for  Im still trying to figure out if they put cinnamon in it or if my taste buds deceived me! Next I had 3 different tacos custom built with chorizo  shrimp and steak  Presentation was good  pricing was good  the atmosphere was hip and very interesting  skulls everywhere  Definitely will be visiting again the next time I take in a Cavs game ,?
1315358,Gabrielle and Huriel work their ass off to make you feel right at home amongst friends  But dont let the staff contagious goodheartedness  their eccentric crafty decor or disco/hiphop infused playlists fool you  the REAL STAR is their inventive  fragrant menu offering  From the zesty kimchi Bloody ceasar to their crisp pork shoulder green curry served with tons of fresh herbs  theres something for every pallet  whether youre vegan or meat lover  looking for generous comfort food or a good spice kick!P S: Yelp doesnt want to change the tag set  but Bighi is a multiethinic curry restaurant (mostly Japanese  Indian and Thai) ,?
1315360,Gabrielle in the country store was super polite and helpful  Thank you! And the food is always amazing ,?
1315371,Gaby Et Jules have the most impeccable pastries in Pittsburgh  However I think its too sweet for me  I miss some delicacy in the flavor The customer service is very good and if youre looking for great macaroons  definitely this is the best place in the city  There are great variety of flavors and their consistency,?
1315423,Gadzooks! YAY! Initially I was a bit leery of the redefining the enchilada slogan  I thought  I do not want to redefine the enchilada  I love enchiladas just the way they are  However  I was extremely surprised & thrilled by Gadzooks  The tortillas are made fresh & onsite  as are all the menus items  Although  the menu is posted high on the wall & the restaurant is run buffet style  do not be discouraged  Gadzooks makes the best enchiladas & tacos! Each order is personalized to the specific likes of the customer  There are a multitude of options for the vegetarian set & all of them are delicious!  Ive yet to try their soups  but I hear they are fantastic  The staff is kind  and helpful and they know their products well  Although  busy during the lunch time rush  Gadzooks is well worth the wait  I know the owner is the first one there in the morning & the last to leave  Thus  showing great pride in a very unique concept  Go! Go! GO!,?
1315989,Games are fun   food is disgusting   Seriously over priced and has no flavor   Dont waste your money especially in downtown summerlin where there are tons of restaurants that are far better!,?
1317708,Gave 1 star because I had to  I ordered dinner over the phone and went to get it and when I arrived they were not taking credit cards   It was just a salad so I was only told 10 minutes and the credit card machine had been down for awhile   So why wasnt I told that over the phone? I tried to call today and order because Im staying at the hotel next door and its easy and the closest place  However   I asked if they were taking credit cards today and was put on hold which I think she just left the phone off the hook and then a minute and a half later someone just hung up on me  Applebees is a crappy restaurant and will always remain crappy no matter the redecoration or new menu   If you cant get decent staff no one is going to want to go  I thought I would give it a try but Im done now ,?
1317957,Gave it a try yesterday and I am impressed the food was amazing  if you love Poke give this place a try  there are plenty of selections to choose from for creating your perfect Poke Bowl!!!!,?
1318202,Gave the restaurant a second shot  equally disappointed   Bar service was slow  45 minutes to get an appetizer from an inattentive waitress   Once at our table  we watched our salads walk around the restaurant twice before the server found our table   Waiter served the entrees and walked away  never checked to see how our meal was   While tasty  the portions are small Unfortunately  the best part of this restaurant is the valet service   Dont frustrate yourself  dine elsewhere with friends ,?
1318819,Gave us shelter from the rain  The coffee was nothing special  but good  Really elegant decor and cups  Seems to be a popular spot for tourists and students so its rather loud  Friendly staff!,?
1319036,Gee  this buffet used to be so good now its horrible    Was in Las Vegas last week and couldnt wait to eat at the Paris buffet    This was our first stop upon arriving in Vegas    What a letdown    The line for the buffet wasnt that long but it took over 45 minutes just to get a table   They didnt have enough people working    The food quality and selection has really gone downhill    No Coq Au Vin     Thats what I was craving the most    The made to order crepes are still quite good though     The best buffet in Vegas now  in my opinion  is the Wynn which has good quality  high end food ,?
1319368,Gelato  super yum! White coffee is my favorite (but they rarely have it) Breakfast  great prices and just enough to fill your belly but not overeatDessert  Half baked cookie with your choice of gelato on top! Seriously   heaven in your mouth Coffee  very strong  if you like medium strength  you need to mention it to the BaristaAmbience  sad and painful to look at  Its like the place is having an identity crisis  are they a gelato bar  a wine bar  coffee bar  lounge  cafe  night club  family hangout   its weird  The place needs a makeover   bad Paninis  Yummy but whimpy  just a couple bucks over priced for the amount on your sandwich ,?
1319511,Gelato was at room temperature and the worker did not use gloves while handling cones   Also started flirting with me in front of my boyfriend   my Gelato melted by the time I got to eat it,?
1319666,Gemma is amazing!! My base is so shiny and the color has lasted for such a long time    and my highlights are unbelievable !! Shes an incredible artist    and a complete doll! So lucky to have stumbled upon her! She books up super fast FYI!! Her Facebook is Gemma Markowicz  Hairstylist Gems Hair is her instagram,?
1320201,Generally good technicians  Open long hours (until 7 during the week  5 or so on Sundays) and usually crowded on weekends  High staff turnover  Overall a cut above average  Bonus: right by froyo  Panera  & other restaurants  so if you are running late you can also pick up dinner ,?
1320454,Generally  Churchs is not a place to expect much but its at least adequate   My order started off with a broken ordering speaker   Once I received my order I had to turn around and head back because my sides were wrong   This was the first time I had actually been inside this store and it stinks like rancid grease   The staff is apologetic and corrects my order so I leave happy enough   I then have to return again once I open the giant box of chicken strips  only to find the small  cold hard strips of chicken huddling in one forth of the oversized box   Once again  I return to the grease pit to have chicken over explained to me by a lady I can only assume was in charge   Her lack of name tag made it impossible to know who she was  but she was the loudest  rudest person in the shop   After having a good 45 minutes of my day wasted I left with hot  properly sized chicken   This place is a relic and needs to be shut down ,?
1321442,George cleaned my carpets yesterday for the 1st time and he will definitely be coming back   The carpets look awesome   He spent more time on them than anyone ever has   He was very knowledgeable and did not oversell anything   I highly recommend him and I already booked my next cleaning!  Thanks George great job!,?
1321674,Georges Gyros is definitely the place to go for a gyro fix  The pita bread is so soft and pliable  The tzatziki sauce complements the juicy  thinly sliced meat very well  I love how they use a special slicing tool to shave the meat off the spindle  I always order my gyro with grilled onions make a huge difference versus ordering with the raw onion  Definitely an inexpensive place for lunch or dinner ,?
1322349,Get a taste of the old Las Vegas while sightseeing along Fremont Street  The strip of casinos and shops here is now covered and some sort of light show is shown underneath the coverage  The street comes alive at night with various live music and street entertainers  Its not as glamorous as the main Las Vegas strip  but worth a visit if you have not explored this area yet ,?
1322662,Get it to go corned beef and hash or where it go like 2 bites what a rip off  If you dont want to do deliveries just remove it horrible,?
1323222,Get the BangARang wings   Go here for the wings  you wont want to go back to the wing chains again!  Garlic Parmesan wings also good   depends on your mood as to what to choose ,?
1323453,Get the Sangria   yumm!!!Had the prix fixe restaurant week menu  Me: strawberry buratta crostini  pork cheeks  and carrot cake  Hubs: tomato gazpacho  sea trout  chocolate clafoutisEverything was great  I switched entrees with hubs and he was thrilled  The carrot cake was fantastic,?
1323740,Get the curry beef  pumpkin  and pork   Id come back here for the curry beef alone  If youre looking for affordable Japanese tapas  this is a good place to check out  especially if youve already tried Ichiza and are looking for something new  Dont forget to try the yuzu sorbet! Super refreshing!,?
1323904,Get the happy hour deal  You get a cabin that has a bar and bathroom! The bar has unlimited drinks  Our bartender Phaedra was a blast  She showed us all the highlights as we traveled around the ferris wheel  Happy hour deal was around $30 a ticket ,?
1324554,Get to the counter at 5:31 and wont help up because the department closes at 5:30  You really wont help because of a few seconds? Ridiculous  Trying to open an account and cant because of seconds  Looks like well be going else where  This branch is terrible ,?
1324744,Get your motor running  Enjoyed the infinity race   Next April 7th  The Silver Crown car are coming again  Then watch the Indy Cars under the lights  Get your tickets to enjoy some close racing,?
1325857,Geudos Taco Shop   Not The Original Location  But The Food Remains The Same!We used to eat Guedos at least one or twice a month when I was in College   Back then  Guedos was located in Downtown Chandler and had the first sandy beach patio in town Fast forward 20 years and Guedos is no longer located in Downtown Chandler  but in South Gilbert   Great location  but sans sandy beach patio   This is okay though  as the menu and quality of food have remained the same The new Guedo (new owner) has kept all the original recipes from the old menu and they are all just as good as I remember from back in the day   This is still a family owned and operated business and I hope all my Yelp friends will support their wonderful restaurant!Cheers!,?
1326269,Giant Eagle is a supermarket company based out of the Pittsburgh Area  This is by far the nicest Giant Eagle I have ever been to! They have everything! Ice cold beer in its own refrigerated room  lots of beef  seafood  sushi  wine  lots of ready to cook and pre cooked foods This would be the perfect place to go for a quick meal to take home a cook for a date when your low on time and still take all the credit Everything is easy to find and the store is easy to navigate  I even like how the little black shopping carts have a little section just for your bread so it wont get smashed  All in all great store!,?
1326628,Gigis cupcakes are delicious  There is no doubt about it  The staff is great and going through a huge change because previously it was awful  See bad reviews All in all  the cupcakes are finely decorated with lots of frosting  sugar  and sprinkles! Sprinkles are for winners ,?
1327173,Ginger pho is okay The food here did not blow me away as I expected  Maybe I came in with high expectations and it didnt meet my expectations  but this place can use some help  Food: okay  nothing special  For an area with a lot of pho stores  This place would not be my first choice Environment: very clean  and for that reason I would consider going back Customer Service: Excellent  they spoke English which is nice  Not a lot of pho stores have someone that speaks English  OVERALL: I would come back  but I wouldnt go out of my way to make sure I eat here again ,?
1327203,Ginko is quickly becoming one of my favorite happyhour spots in the mont  The restaurant serves the best sushi Ive had in Cleveland  and has a very cool  fun vibe  If you want to try the sushi  but save some money  definitely go for happy hour  4:306:30 MF  Tuna and salmon rolls are $5  beer and cocktails are half off  and a carafe of sake is just $4  My only complaint  as other reviewers have noted  is that most of the seating is along a curved bar  While this is fine if youre just 2 or 3  sitting against the bar is not ideal for more than a few people  something to keep in mind if you go with a larger group ,?
1328043,Give it 3 5 stars  Service is really quick I got my food in about 510min  I had the Arizona burrito  It was pretty good  Filled with tender pork topped with green chili  The green chili was flavorful  I would recommend  The fish tacos looked good too ,?
1328168,Give the best 5 stars   when someone earns it  Ali Baba is a great place to dine and enjoy the true flavor of Arabia   Food tasted amazing no matter what you order   I got the Largest Mazza Combo   Falafel   Kuba  Tabuleh  Hummus  Baba Ghanug  pastirma  Labni Foul Grape leaves  Armenian Sausages and Arabic Bread  We couldnt finish the food although its the best we tasted so far   I wish we have a branch in Fresno   Ali Baba also had Hookahs and live music on weekends   too bad we missed it   But we will be back for sure   very soon  Thanks to Waseem our evening was magnificent dining experience ,?
1328302,Given I travel for business most weeks  I am a big fan of the Courtyard hotels from Marriott   They are always a good hotel for the price  have the amenities that keep a business traveler happy  and are usually located just where youd expect them to be Such was the case with this Courtyard   The Bistro here pours a decent glass of wine (usually what I need after my long days of meetings) and the breakfast/coffee in the morning gets me on my way   The staff is friendly  the rooms are clean  the prices are reasonable and there is coffee in the rooms   Pretty much checks off all my boxes for what I need in a hotel If you dont need to stay at one of the fabulous resorts in this area  check out the Courtyard   A little hard to find as it is tucked away behind a strip mall  but a great nights sleep!,?
1329734,Giving this place 4 stars  When I walked in  I was a little deterred by the wat it looked inside  very small  But We sat down  The waitress was very nice  She helped us with the menu since not all of the items on the menu had a description   We ordered the creamy mermaid  jalepeno bomb  volcano roll sunset roll and rock n roll  The food tasted fresh and came out quickly  I would not order the creamy mermaid again or the rock n roll but everything was pleasant And I had a good time  They even had a wheel to spin for a prize on your next visit  Would recommend and return ,?
1330099,Glad I dont have to go all the way to NY for a frozen hot chocolate  Yes the name sounds ironic but it is what it sounds like  Hot chocolate but frozen  I noticed they had other flavors which Ill have to try when I go back  The best thing about this place is  its outside and has Togo service!Dont have to go thru the trouble of getting thru a casino to get this dessert drink Located at the CPs casino ,?
1330767,Glad to have a butcher back in this Henderson space   Their meats are excellent and the only place in town that has both the quality and variety they have here   From Prime  to choice  sausage to filet  pork  chicken and even exotic meats  they have everything   I do miss the cooking spices and sauces from the previous butcher shop that occupied this space but otherwise  this is a must go to for all meat needs ,?
1330851,Glad to have one close to home  I have been to two other locations also the San tan location and the mesa location and have had way better customer service experiences  Ive been to this location twice and both times there has been many dirty tables left even though they werent so busy  The high chairs werent too clean so it was difficult to find one for my daughter   Like the food  but they need to work on a few details!,?
1331079,Glad to see this place first thing in the morning! Everyone is really friendly and they work supper fast  The only negative is everything is double the price  The convenience of having you morning coffee and pastry right when You get off the elevator makes it worth it though,?
1332041,Gluten free Pancakes and toast  Sold  Im a regular  Just ask for the special menu and youll find almost all omelet and skillet choices are glutenfree ,?
1332083,Gluten free cookies are delicious and at a reasonable price! They also have gluten free cookie dough    ,?
1334838,Go see Thom Jones  Hes the best  He knows his stuff  Very knowledgeable & all around great guy  I bought a bike from them that I found online & everyone was fantastic  I will go back to buy again  Go talk to them  You wont regret it ,?
1334919,Go smell this bakery   It is one of the best smelling bakeries of all time   When you are done inhaling free happiness  talk to one of the awesome workers behind the counter   Generally  theyre a pretty friendly group The cupcakes with raspberry icing ($2 11 including tax) are delicious!  They use real raspberries  which you can see in the icing   Now  dont quote me on this  but I BELIEVE one of the employees told me they use all natural ingredients  at least for these cupcakes   Cool!I have tried many samples of their bread and been super impressed  and I cannot walk out of her without buying one   The loaves are super reasonably priced   I love the sour dough  cinnamon twist  and Italian   They also have bread cards!!!  Buy eight loaves and get one free!!  What a steal!,?
1334959,Go somewhere else! 3 out of the 4x we went there they screwed up somewhere  First time they didnt put my oil cap back on and left it on the engine  Luckily it was still there weeks after the service  Second time they failed to put the cover back on for the air filter intake box  Third we went in to rotate the tires and they never did it  I know this because I marked my 2 front tires just to be sure they were doing theyre job  And of course my hunch was correct  Both marked tires was still on the front  This is the final straw for me and Im not paying for service theyre anymore  Absolutely would not recommend them to anyone ,?
1336637,God tier food with great customer service  Ive never been disappointed by a meal here ,?
1337347,Going on vacation? Go to this shop!!! They have everything  I had so many choices it was hard to decide  The sales staff was very helpful and brought me suits I never would have tried on and loved ,?
1337779,Going to a wedding tonight  and in desperate need of a lastminute mani/pedi  so checked out Yelp  and came across Vanity  They squeezed two of us in  and one hour later  we were done! Just $32 for mani/pedi; credit cards accepted  but cash preferred I had Tracy  and she did a great job  was very sweet  and even did a nice arm and leg massage   Definitely recommend!,?
1339150,Gonna be honest  I was nervous to take my puppy to Hickory Hills after reading the reviews  But  because of my everchanging schedule  I wanted to give it a try since they allow walkins (our usual daycare place that is closer to home is full a lot of the time)  I came to pick him up at around 430  he was happy  healthy  and incredibly tired  Cant really ask more of a dog daycare place  They give you your first day of daycare free which was really nice! And I asked them to cut my pups nails (he HATES it) and they did a great job!Overall  I think some people are probably right  they allow a lot of dogs to not that many people  This is the only way they can allow for walkins  which is invaluable I think  My dog is wonderful with other dogs so I dont foresee it being a problem for him anyways  Definitely will return :) ,?
1339382,Good American style Mexican food  I say that because there isnt the Hispanic music or even chips and salsa  BUT our food was great with large portions and yummy sauces   I had the chicken flautas and my husband had the chimichanga   (See picture)Our server  Shajuan  was very attentive and helped with recommendations from the menu   The atmosphere was lively without being too loud   We ate outside next to the water fountain outside if the Flamingo hotel  I would recommend this to anyone ,?
1339546,Good AYCE sushi place  Ive had better in town and sometimes a couple things they bring out are just a liiiiittle too fishy if you know what I mean  Overall its still a great place ,?
1339629,Good Asian  From sushi to Chinese Thai  and Korean dishes  Pricey but its Vegas Wish I could remember our waiter he was awesome  Very enthusiastic and helpful  Young thin black guy  Excellent service from the gentleman ,?
1340066,Good Chinese food is hard to find  We were pleasantly surprised when we ate here for lunch one day  Will definitely go back ,?
1340520,Good Food!! Good atmosphere!!! Terrible ServiceI know   I know   I always say service usually depends on the server but nevertheless I do have to mention it here  Our server seemed pretty friendly at first until we were seated and then it all went down  Im not sure if he was trying to friendly but it just came out to be simply rude We started off with some appetizers and being here for the first time  we asked for few more minutes to decide on the entree  Our servers response Hurry Up! Okay  not that we were taking that much time and I would probably understand if the place was packed which it wasnt The food here is good  The buffet supposedly a lot better but havent had the chance to try yet  Given the service  I think the buffet is the way to go at this place ,?
1340549,Good Food  Good Service  Lamb Chops  Cheese Macaroni  Sea Food Platter good quality The servers are great kudos to managing large parties ,?
1340763,Good God  dont go to this place  The food is okay  but the owner is incredibly rude and there are better places for Mediterranean food in town  Id pick Oliva any day of the week  Overpriced and bad service  Spend your money elsewhere ,?
1341232,Good Korean food outside of Chinatown!Its found in the shopping center with the Regal Colonnade 14 movie theater  From what my boyfriend has told me  many stores have come and gone in that area  but this restaurant still stands  so it must be good right?I ordered the stone pot bibimbap  which was really delicious! It comes with bulgogi  cucumbers  bean sprouts  mushrooms  rice and topped with an egg  The hot stone pot gives the very bottom layer of rice a crispy texture  The size of the bowl is bigger than some of the other Korean restaurants Ive been to and cheaper as well My boyfriend ordered Juns special and my friend ordered the mandoo soup  Both agreed that their dishes were delicious  Id definitely come back here to try the other dishes whenever I have a craving for Korean food and dont want to make the drive to Chinatown ,?
1342879,Good ambience! Good prices! Fun games to play with friends! And perfect closing hours for a late night hang out!,?
1343016,Good and bad  The good is there is a lot of variety to choose from and the staff is always willing to help  The bad is they always seem to be out of the one product I actually go there for  and the advice they offer isnt always good    my mom is a hairdresser so I know a fair share about colours and the advice I have been given in the past has made me stop and ask why are you employed here?!,?
1343064,Good and clean  It has lots of tables but it gets pretty busy  The restrooms are locked and you need a code to get in since it is in a not so nice neighborhood  Plenty of electric outlets for you to plug in your laptop ,?
1343309,Good and unique breakfast choices on menu   Its usually crowded but its because its a popular place  Its very busy always but the food is great  Its worth the wait   I will return  ,?
1343655,Good atmosphere for happy hour  Great tasting beers on tap! Especially love the Pineapple beer!,?
1343706,Good atmosphere! Classy but casual  The staff there was very nice and attentive  The food was good  the Arancini was amazing! I got the Chicken Milanese  and it was good! Although based off the menu description I was expecting something different  So I was a little disappointed on that front  but the meal was still good  It was a large breaded chicken breast with the green salad on top  Would recommend and will come back when in the area!,?
1343774,Good atmosphere  friendly service and awesome life music  Theres karaoke as well  So  you can sing your heart out if you want to ,?
1344229,Good bagels  but wish they would toast them better  Not sure if thats theyre technique but a soggy bagel is never great in my book  Was ecstatic when we learnt we had a bagel spot in our neighborhood  but these bagels pale in comparison to spots in other big cities  Staff were very nice and the place had great service  Just wish the bagels were a little better ,?
1344267,Good ball park  Apple maps seemed to have a challenge with directions  telling us to drive across the airport Tarmac  Once we got there  we found a wholesome little ball park  We went to a night game  The sun must be pretty strong for day games  there is a free sun screen dispenser  The food options are good  including Cincinnatis Skyline Chili  The $5 fee to park in a dirt lot is unnecessary  but it is not a reason to stay away ,?
1345165,Good beer  very cozy  bartender was super friendly  loved all the entertainment options i e  Video games   board games  random movies playing in the background   Its a great place to come for a laid back night of drinking beer and enjoying good company!,?
1345450,Good breakfast  buffet selection  I would like more gluten free and healthy choices  such as more variety of fresh fruit and gluten free breads and pastries  Staff is extremely friendly and helpful  Gwen is the best server ever! A shout out to Curtis the omelet maker   Carmen in desserts and the young man who serves soup  while making sushi at breakfast ,?
1345987,Good buffet   very spacious so you can enjoy your party and not feel apart of the party next to you   Very friendly customer service & helpful   Waitress kept table clear of plates at all times & very nice her name was Tammy   the bartender was even a joy made me laugh every time I got a glass of wine his name was Chris   The food was decent for the price and for a buffet   I think my favorite was Asia then Italy   The salad bar was fresh and had a lot of varieties   Tammy told us Sunday is Salmon night so Ill have to go back on a Sunday night to experience it again   Definitely recommend it,?
1346282,Good burger  great tots! Burger was perfectly cooked and the apple bacon jam was tasty  The tots were hot & crisp but not greasesoaked like so many other places serve ,?
1346785,Good burrito  good service  Definitely would come back for a quick mexican fix  I still want to try more from the menu,?
1348203,Good coffee and truffles  Quiet studying environment  Ill definitely be coming here often!,?
1348285,Good coffee options are not a problem in Kent  so where you go is more a matter of style and ambience than quality   In my view  Scribbles has the funkiness and coziness that nearby Tree City lacks   Both places present good college town coffee options  but whereas the latter  on the average morning  is a sea of laptops and cell phones captained by tweeting  texting  videowatching undergrads (no  they arent doing homework)  the former is a quiet  downstream retreat where one can still hear occasional conversations between actual people The chalkboard of espresso concoctions that you see to the right of the counter as you walk in is awesome: its a lineup of $3 classics such as the cortado and the affogato that reminds you how nice good espresso can taste when not diluted by a deluge of milky liquid on top   Order yours in a forhere cup  sip slowly  and enjoy the peace and quiet ,?
1348298,Good coffee shop  by why arent they opening before 11 am? I need my coffee in the morning    not half way through my day ,?
1348497,Good coffee  much better than Starbucks  I had a beagle and coffee there this morning  it was very good  The employees there are ver nice too ,?
1348883,Good consistent food  Would love a mobile app where I could order/pay on my phone and then pick it up  RIght now I call to order but I still have to wait in line to pay and the food gets cold   ,?
1349158,Good customer service and everyone I spoke to was very knowledgeable  First time here but I have a feeling all be back ,?
1349496,Good deal for the $   Across the street  short walk to MGM  Paid less than 1/2 what MGM cost   Front desk guy was cool   Room is clean and A/C works perfectly   Two Motel 6 rooms I looked at smelled like cigarettes ,?
1351493,Good flavourful food! Not sure if its worth all the trouble getting in/ being cramped into the tiny space/sharing a table with others (be prepared for that if you are a group of two)Waiting for an 1 5h during the winter is not fun at all But thats just IMHO it might be different for you  Fun place to try once for sure  My verdict: wouldnt go again  unless i find myself around the area on a weekday ,?
1351716,Good food (wiener schnitzel is a musttry)  generous portions  decent variety; cold beer  bartender/waitress was friendly and best of all they were open when all the rest of Newmarket was asleep! My brother and I went to Newmarket on business a month ago and had good experience at the Nest  This trip we wanted to try something new but these other restaurants/kitchens wont serve at 9pm on a Tuesday when they state that they are open until at least 10pm  We were about to starve but stopped in and they were more than happy to serve us  My brother liked his burger  patties were made inhouse instead of premade/frozen  Interior has charm ,?
1352140,Good food and a very fun atmosphere  We eat here often and most of the time served is good  On weekends they have live Mexican music ,?
1352430,Good food and drinks but terrible service! Came here for a round of drinks and apps after work and the mess started when two people from our group wanted to clear their tab and leave early  The server took over 20 minutes to come to the table so we decided to pay at the front  SHE THREW A MASSIVE FIT! She clearly wanted a tip at any cost and when we explained that the two were running late she didnt care to apologize  Later when we order nachos for the table with no chili she stormed away while we were talking to her saying that the two who left early didnt tip her enough (with good reason)  The manager also showed little concern for our complaint  He instead called her their best server     I wonder who their worst is ,?
1352677,Good food and friendly staff Ive always enjoyed myself here Maybe Ill go again later this week hmm ,?
1354115,Good food and very nice atmosphere  Family friends or dates would love this place  A little pricey  but the food was excellent  Had the sea bass and thoroughly enjoyed it ,?
1354365,Good food at an amazing price  That being said  they seem to be working out the kinks of a new restaurant  which makes it hard to give it a fourth star  The drinks and appetizers were excellent  but my entree was a real struggle to get through  It was a parsnip cream sauce over excellent fresh pasta  but the parsnip sauce was very bitter and bland  Salt was requested to take the edge off  which apparently is frowned upon since it took maybe 10 minutes for the waiter to bring me a shot glass with a few salt crystals  Food snobbery like this isnt that offensive to me  but when the restaurant doesnt yet have quality control in place to ensure they arent serving old parsnips  which I am guessing is what happened to those of us unfortunate enough to order the pasta that night  it is really disappointing  All this aside  the space is great  and the quality of the rest of the dishes was enough to make me want to try again ,?
1354545,Good food but I have had better Indian food in other restaurants   Cant complain though   It was just ok though overall,?
1354917,Good food but on the pricy side  Its the Best Chinese restaurant around downtown ,?
1355088,Good food but slow service    Much cleaner than J Bs across the street    But J Bs does offer biscuits and gravy as a side    Village Inn does have pie slice Wednesday which is nice  but on that day they will not give you your AARP discount    I live that they give you a carafe of coffee     I had an omelet and it was cooked well ,?
1355349,Good food but very unconsistent based on the cook of the day  Also portions are based on the cook off the day!,?
1355912,Good food good picanha  The waitress was very nice the drinks were very good the meat were also very good they could work a little bit on bringing the meets faster,?
1356824,Good food with friendly service  We had a sampler with brisket  chicken  and sausage all excellent  Good mac & cheese as well!,?
1357298,Good food!!!!!!!  free popcorn too  Very yummy and fun! Had a very delicious dinner  Had a good shot of fireball,?
1357621,Good food  and drinks  They Attempted to provide a good experience for their customers but was very hesitant when we were paying our bills  We asked if we could do separate checks and our server said of course when we started ordering but when we were about to pay  all of our checks were messed up  The server (flustered and annoyed) then said that she will NEVER do this again  that tomorrow will be a new day  It made us feel pretty shitty because it wasnt our fault! She said it wasnt at all a problem something happened behind the scenes(she forgot  she lost her pad of paper with our order  change of servers    ) Maybe Ill give them another shot  with a smaller group  only because the food was great ,?
1357736,Good food  awesome staff  I just wish the place was a little bigger ,?
1357808,Good food  beer  and service   The place is packed after 6:00 pm so youll have to wait for a table ,?
1357998,Good food  but keep in mind that this is NOT a restaurant  No inside dining options  Its more of a warehouse for stocking up on GF breads/desserts/bagels etc  for home  Also  the sign on the outside says Nates Bagels  not Molly Bs    ,?
1358849,Good food  friendly staff!  Try the Tamales or the cilantro chicken salad!  Definitely coming here again!,?
1359453,Good food  good service  GREAT prices for Vegas  Was in town for a conference and the okay quality of $25 breakfast buffets made me search out other options in walking distance  This was worth the 12 minute walk!Large menu with lots of options at great rates  you can do a full standard American breakfast for 7 99!I went back a few times and tried different items in the breakfast menu  everything was good  diner style Service was fine  a little slower during the busy periods  but not unexpectedly  They got one of my orders wrong  but were able to remake it fairly quickly Coffee was nothing to write home about  standard diner quality  about as good as the free hotel coffee If Im back and nearby again  Id eat here again!,?
1360078,Good food  great prices and well managed  The dining area is always kept well cleaned despite being busy during rush hours  and the restrooms are also immaculate Would highly recommend ,?
1360947,Good food  odd service The food was pretty delicious  foie gras just melted in your mouth  piglet belly was tender and not overly fatty and the upsidedown pear cake was very tasty even after a fairly filling meal  I also picked at my friends food (lamb medallions  trio of creme brulee) and it was all very good Now the service    at first the waitress was very nice to us and then all of the sudden  with no apparent provocation she turned into an ice cold b*tch  And half way through the dinner another waitress took over our table  while the first one was just giving us dirty looks from a distance  No idea what that was all about  Needless to say that made the whole dinner experience very uncomfortable ,?
1360965,Good food  okay pricing for the quantity The dishes taste good for the most part the shrimp tandoor thing was so great flavourful with big shrimp  The Brie pakoras were great  you have to try them!! but I would have liked more for the price We tried some vegetarian curries and some classic meat ones  as well as the butter chicken  which was sweet? Im not a fan of sweet butter chicken but it was creamy The naan was bone dry like so dry I had to ask for some sort of oil or butter on it  Also they forgot to bring us a naan which was included with our dish Good Indian food  decent flavour and could improve with quantity of the appetizers ,?
1361469,Good food  terrible service I would not recommend visiting with a group of six people or more  An automatic 15% gratuity is added to large groups  and the staff seem to have problems with basic arithmetic when it comes to splitting the check  my $4 65 coffee came out to $7 25 when the tip was added  I told the cashier this was unacceptable and she argued that I should pay 1/6 of the groups tip instead of 15% on top of what I actually ordered  She then cursed me out to another employee in Vietnamese ,?
1362625,Good food  Good prices  20 wings is  $12 95  Thats a smoking deal  With a large pepperoni pizza came out to $26 out the door  But we stayed in the door  Watched soccer sitting in their comfortable racing style seating  Dude was In such a good mood when Greece scored he brought out some complimentary garlic knots ,?
1362770,Good food  Great coffee (they use Soltice Brewers)  Good service  fair prices  Great music selections!,?
1363139,Good food  Nice atmosphere  Clean and inviting service could use some help  but we were overall satisfied ,?
1363238,Good food  One thing to note is that their batter is all glutenfree  so they are not traditional crepes  The other downside is that its a bit expensive  The food was good though  and the staff was friendly  We would return ,?
1363834,Good food   convenient that its located on the Rita Suites Hotel where we stayed  The hotel gave us some credits towards food and drinks  We ordered two different types of pizza  salad  and Chicken Fingers  Food was fresh and tastey  Waitress was a sweetheart   We are coming back later for drinks,?
1364042,Good for a fast healthy option that is reasonable priced  although you have to know what to order I really like their tabouli  tossed greek salad and roll up entrees  Everything else Ive tried has not been so great  the chicken is always overcooked so Ive stopped ordering it  their tuna salad is super bland with an odd consistency  and the sauce on their chicken marinara tasted like it came from a can ,?
1364307,Good for drinks  but after eating here twice I dont think my stomach can handle their food a third time ,?
1364370,Good for kids because they have arcade section and roller coaster But please  please  please  fix the roller coaster because they are bumpy on the head and my son was feeling so dizzy after the ride Food court also close to the arcade  of course choices are for kids liking ,?
1365025,Good gel manicure  Friendly nail tech  reasonably priced   A ton of colors and different polish brands ,?
1365099,Good god do I miss this place   It is delicious   There are chemicals in it  that make you crave it fortnightly   Just as well that its a wee bit off campus  or else I would have been there every day it was open   So many options  and only one short life ,?
1365248,Good gravy!  Good God!  You get a TON of food   I am still full and i ate there in December   The omelette I ordered had a TON of avocados on it   Usually they put like 3 and call it a California Omlette   But no   They put like 7 slices   And did I mention the gravy and biscuits?  Off the strip  waaaay off the strip   Thats how to appreciate Vegas ,?
1365360,Good group of barbers here! Skilled with great personalities and experience  First time here and felt very welcomed in a clean relaxing atmosphere  Kid friendly!Will definitely be back when Im in town and need a haircut ,?
1365754,Good happy hour!!! The truffle fries are ahmaxing  I tried the Buffalo Bill with a fried egg as recommended by another review and it was great ,?
1366502,Good inexpensive breakfast  comfy booths  On King Street on the way to work  Parking on King permitted after 9a  Great service!,?
1366977,Good little bakery as far flavors go  not impressed with their selection  was hoping for more options ,?
1367184,Good little taqueria in Old Town right in the Bar district  Only have two kinds chicken and steak $3 each with your choice of corn or flour tortillas  And good salsa bar ,?
1367631,Good location in Scottsdale but very average on food  We had several side dishes including Mac and cheese  The meats were cooked too long and were dry,?
1367706,Good location to go to if your driving cuz there is loads of free parking and if you need to study on a Saturday they are open late,?
1367976,Good location  Delicious food  Flavorful brews  Reasonable prices These are just a few of the highlights from my recent visits to Southern Tier Brewing  Yesterday Courtney took good care of my friend and I during the lunch hour  I enjoyed the Big Ol Pastrami Reuben with french fries  The bread was perfectly toasted  The house made kraut had a sweet  caramelized onion taste  The fries were crispy with a side of thick  fresh ranch dressing  My friend told me her Smokey Bleu Cheese Wedge was fresh  flavorful and satisfying I was disappointed that my favorite brew  the Southern Tier Raspberry White wasnt on tap anymore  however I did snag a sixpack for home! With my lunch I enjoyed a 3 Citrus Peel Out which was good for a sunny  warm spring day on the patio  I look forward to next time   ,?
1368697,Good mattress  fair price  easy delivery and set up  Just having a hard time getting rid of the old one,?
1368745,Good meal  good service  Went for a work dinner with a party of 10  It was a Wednesday night and besides our table  it was pretty empty  For Appetizers we had the Artichoke which was good and the Ahi Tuna Tartar which was delicious  I had the Potato Leek Soup which I highly recommend if you are a white truffle oil fan  wonderful with a nice presentation with the pancetta  My Kansas City Strip  Bone in was cooked medium rare like I ordered  First time I had a Kansas City Strip and enjoyed it  We had several of the sides since it was a large group  All were good with the 35 Fries standing out  tossed with truffle oil yum! Although there are other steakhouses that I think are a little better for the food and price I would recommend and would come back ,?
1369640,Good office   I love the call ahead check in   Saves time sitting waiting    Drs are thorough and office staff is nice,?
1370962,Good pizza if you are looking for a personal size pizza  I loved the fact I could build my own pizza and it was cooked right in front of me  and the price for the pizza is amazing  Good pizza for a good price ,?
1371575,Good pizza  Service was good  Easy in and out  Bathrooms really needed attention  Otherwise I would have given 5 stars ,?
1371621,Good pizza; for the area its not as strong as IL PAESANO  CALIBREZE or FBI  but when you are in this corner/area; a great choice     still  4th best in etobicoke area ,?
1372978,Good place to eat before the unlv basketball game  Close to the Mack and s good meeting spot ,?
1373516,Good place to grab a drink  Not amazing food  but pretty decent for bar food  Only negative part was the music going from very loud to very quite  A little distracting ,?
1373625,Good place to hang out with good company  Food is pretty decent and they have specials on their drinks free sake when you write a review for them and buy 2 soju get one free  Last two times I came they gave us a small comp snack,?
1374625,Good points: its clean and kids are well looked after  although the teachers play very loud music while the kids are napping  Never understood why it has to be played at full blast  or played at all in fact  Even if its classical  it disrupts sleep when the volume is not low Bad points: there is one teacher in particular that is extremely rude for no reason  This woman it seems  has had no concept of manners at all  Why isnt she at least told by the owners that it it is good business sense to simply say good morning and welcome the children who come in  Shame  A smile costs nothing at all and makes a huge difference Sunny Days: I have been one of your most devoted customers  Dont lose your reputation because one of your employees cant utter the word good morning or spare a smile ,?
1374694,Good portion of burger plate  Very good taste  My favourites : avocado burger  goatcheese burger and mushroom burger  Comes with a red pickle For the poutine  normal nothing special  not the best type of fries for a poutine  and a lot of sauce Nice terrasse with confortable chairs and ambiance outside ,?
1374759,Good portions and good tasting food  Its a fairly spacious restaurant and the staff are quite friendly here I mostly go for the pork bone soup which they give you a lot of meat and bones and the soup is so good!! It just warns you right up  especially on chilly nights :)Its a good place to go for a quick bite or a nice inexpensive meal with groups of friends,?
1374862,Good portions  Tons of tropical fruit  Crepes!   But just average results Giant  confusing menu; the staff is helpful but theres only so much you can do with such an onslaught of choices  The bacon was basically popcorn and the eggs were forgetable  My suggestion? Skip breakfast  go straight to the yummy crepes  and add one of those blended tropical drinks  Thats a recipe for a four star review right there ,?
1375022,Good price for beers during happy hour  Good atmosphere  Pizza was okay  not worth the price  Then again it sat for over 20 minutes before being brought to our table for take out  The bartender did offer to have it remade  however  we had run out of time and couldnt wait  Pizza box was cold so that shows how long it sat  By the time we got home we had to place in oven to warm up  Will try again in the future for Italian fare   Menu looked good and reasonably priced  Staff was friendly ,?
1375164,Good price  great food! Loved the Japango  it had a really nice flavour Im not sure I can place  but loved it  The ginger ice cream was also a nice treat ,?
1376223,Good quality lamb belly  Sad that they only had fake Sugus (like Starburst chews but so much better)  and not the real brand  Oh  They also have Horlicks candy  Havent seen those in a while  Not cheap though ,?
1376876,Good restaurant I come here somewhat often never too impressed but never disappointed  There is some stuff that Id stay away from on the menu  For example  the sandwiches are hit and miss  Id generally stay away from them Pizza are decent and you may opt for a calzone with any of the pizza toppings  Ive also tried the pastas  obviously not like home made but pretty decent for a quickrestaurant type atmosphere For Italian  there are lots of places Id go before here  but thats not to say this is a bad restaurant ,?
1377023,Good salad and yummy burger  Sweet potato fries were ok  The comp popcorn is a great start  Beer was good  too!,?
1377120,Good sandwich for what youre buying  Definitely better than subway! Low prices and good daily specials  Ill be back ,?
1377362,Good seafood and meat  Definitely recommend this place if you can afford it(Short review lol),?
1378908,Good service and quite a variety of dishes   I was amazed with the beef curry   The meat was so tender I had to have it twice   I was less impressed with the watery looking and tasting shrimp dish   The chicken tandoori appeared dried  out   The price is a bit steep at $17 95  but I was overall happy with what I received ,?
1378931,Good service and tasty hand tossed noodle  lamb barbecue skewer is the best i ever had  good price  Nothing to complain  will come back ,?
1380066,Good service  mediocre and overpriced food   Dont plan on anything special if you are there for a birthday celebration ,?
1380239,Good service  tasty food   I dont drink  so cant comment on the alcohol selection/quality  although it looked pretty extensive My boyfriend and I ordered nachos  a NY style pizza  and a spinach artichoke calzone (minus sundried tomatoes   yuck)   The nachos were really good and had plenty of toppings   My calzone was was also delicious  the artichoke hearts were tender and there was plenty of sauce on the side   My boyfriends pizza looked good and he seemed to enjoy it   We were both already pretty full from the nachos  however  so we had plenty of leftovers (not a bad thing!)After reading some reviews and looking at the website  I was afraid that this place might be like a smallchain version of Chilis or UNO or something   Fortunately  it wasnt   The food was great and our waitress was very friendly and promptly filled our requests   Well definitely be back (probably on a Tuesday for 1/2 price pizza!),?
1380562,Good service  Good food  I recommend the knife shaved noodles with tomato  Tasty! The beef shang noodles had tender tasty beef and broth  not too crazy about the pulled noodles  they do give you a ton  Fried rice was ok  Spicy wontons were bomb! I ordered 2 servings and Im glad I did  Good value for the price  Might go back next time Im in Vegas ,?
1380838,Good service    room was unique   neighbors next door partied til 6am   security n front desk did everything they could! Lounge is always a fun time   want to try Rumors next!!!,?
1381161,Good size meal  good price  Hot tea was complimentary   I didnt count but there were 67 varieties of appetizers   Quite a treat Only problem is service was slow  after the meal was served never saw them much and it was hard to flag them down to get the bill   Must be end of day  will try again ,?
1381796,Good spot for a funny gift or card along with a variety of other things  Always try to stop by here when looking for a gift for anyone ,?
1381998,Good spot in Glendale with a pretty interesting variety of food types  We went for happy hour and got the burrata to start  followed by the fish tacos (for me) and the eggplant parm sandwich (for my friend)  Id definitely recommend all three of those dishes (I didnt try the eggplant but my friend loved it)  and I would come back here to try other things as well ,?
1382000,Good spot in Plaza Midwood   The scene is very chill and the wait staff is downtoearth   I liked the back deck and super pingpong area   They also have pool tables inside   I didnt check out the food menu  but the front patio was packed with diners   Beer selection was moderate  with quite a few options on tap   Not a scene place in my mind and great to go with some friends to have an enjoyable evening with light activity ,?
1382083,Good spot to go to after work with strong drinks and good service  Granted  if youre an Ass youre probably gonna get shit service  and you probably deserve it  I would try to avoid during peak hours since it can get slammed during and theres only 15 seats at the bar  The food here is not great so Id come here for the bar only ,?
1382185,Good spot  off the Strip  to catch a movie ,?
1382494,Good store and helpful staff  Has what I need  More expensive than Amazon  but still useful ,?
1383137,Good sub place  Bread was good  Only con is its out of the way of the Pitt campus (relative to everything else)  It is worth the walk though  I would go back ,?
1383437,Good sushi place    you will be able to find some unique cuts of tuna that you cant find at most sushi places    the prices are pretty good    you have to try the noodle bowl thing    i guess hiro (th owner)  is famous for this thing    the atmosphere is nothign special    it is in a strip mall with typical sushi decorations    but i would definatly go back if i was in the area   ,?
1383547,Good sushi  good environment and fast service just not super duper friendly  Totally worth it to go during happy hour with great pricing  The sushi is fresh and gets made super fast  The chef made them quick and was friendly  Definitely recommend coming here for the happy hours!,?
1383552,Good sushi  good prices! So good the first time we came back less than a week later  Sushi was fresh and the curry had a nice spice  Service was great and quick ,?
1383574,Good sushi  had a number of different but the spicy tuna is always great  A bit pricy given a relatively simple interior and it only being sushi  Tastewise the food is good and a nice alternative to all the mexican and us food in the area,?
1384012,Good tasting fish and chips !!!  One of the better fish and chips in Markham  Fish is always done right  and fries and onion rings are done right too  I only take out  due to small eating area inside   4 stars  as mentioned in another review  the tarter sauce should be made in store and given out in a little container rather than packets I tired halibut house a few times now  i prefer windjammers fish and chips Lots of parking  friendly owners ,?
1384566,Good times where spent here in the past be it my bachelor party last year or my friends sons baptism  Which ever your reason for visiting a strip club  Spearmint in Las Vegas is a must do  The atmosphere is intoxicating and the women are entertaining  Just a tip for the rookies  take a limo from your casino and tip the driver well this way you avoid lines and cover charge  (most of the the time the driver  doesnt charge you for the ride if its at least a party of 78) Also make sure you bring enough cash the ATM surcharge inside is $40 ,?
1385657,Good view of bellagio Water falls  Music ok  Promoters doing usual pathetic advertisement  Typical Vegas club  Ok  It not amazing but it not horrible,?
1386252,Good!  Much better in fact than I expected given that this restaurant was at the back of a grocery store   The service was good  the food well priced    my only complaint was that the flan I was given had over curdled and lacked that luxurious creme Brule like consistency that I craved,?
1386850,Good  fast  crispy wings  Their ranch is AMAZING  if you are a ranch junkie like myself you must try it ! Will definitely be back  atmosphere isnt the best so I definitely suggest getting your order togo   Lemon Pepper & Honey Hot are both delish !!,?
1386941,Good  friendly service with a great atmosphere  The food is average and overpriced ,?
1387210,Good  quick food in a great location  Ive been eating here for years  and though the chicken quality varies and bold flavor is lacking  you cant go wrong with the combination platter of bourbon chicken  mixed vegetables  and lo mein  You can always count on this place to provide lots of food for some of the lowest prices in oakland  Theres plenty of outdoor seating and often musical entertainment in the summer  The bubble tea is a refresher during the hottest days  and they also provide fountain drink refills for a quarter  Convenient  good value  and pleasant staff ,?
1387324,Good  solid barbecue joint   Their ribs and their pulled pork were delicious  definitely the stars of my plate   I really love that they offer choices of sauce so that you can enjoy your bbq more on the sweet or more on the sour side or even with no sauce  if you like   I went last month  and though I remember enjoying my sides  I dont remember what they were   So I guess that means they were good but not better than the meat   I wasnt a huge fan of their deviled eggs  a little too vinegary for my taste   I enjoyed their sweet tea  and my coworker was ready to write love notes to his strawberry lemonade The wait staff was friendly  not the fastest service in the West  but not painfully slow either All in all  a positive barbecue experience   Id return ,?
1388050,Goodbye subway   hello firehouse! I had the New York Steamer and it was the best sandwich ive ever had at a chain sandwich shop! And dont forget to try their bbq sauce  its the bomb!,?
1388182,Goodness  this was the best Winking Lizard Ive been to so far!  Its dinner time and we were seated promptly in an almost packed place   Our server was always attentive and in a good mood   He got us everything we wanted and was even patient with our questions   I never had to search for him for a new ketchup bottle or more drink   Plenty of napkins for my awesome wings and the wedge salad was to die for!  Prompt friendly service topped with great food gets 5 stars in my book!!,?
1389071,Gorgeous ambience and family friendly  I think I like their offerings better than Tabule! My friends and I got a couple of dishes and brunched away  I wish they served up the drinks posted on their website but sadly its all bottled sodas and average coffee and tea served in pretty wares  Food was absolutely delicious!,?
1389398,Gorgeous interior  Music could use some work on regular nights  but they do allow a lot of high quality promoters to bring in topnotch underground hiphop and house headliners occasionally  For bottle service  this is the most spacious and well appointed club in the city  Theres a huge selection of tables available  many of which are far away from the action allowing you to actually hear each other Beware the door policy    its very inconsistent ,?
1389608,Gorgeous restaurant! They spared no expense when designing it  Love the open air windows  firepit  bar area  Definitely this is a place to dress up and people watch the older Scts hipsters   Atmosphere is one of the best in ScottsdaleHOWEVER   Sadly  My tanzy salad was not so hot   the lettuce was wilted and the other veggies were definitely old  I ended up getting a bad stomach for several days afterward   I ordered chicken for the salad which was tasty and a good sized portion  My friends said they liked their food but I didnt hear delicious ever come out of their mouths   One had scallops and the other had the roasted chicken   If i were to return  i would order the scallops because not only did the plate look gorgeous  the mushrooms and sauce looked wonderful   THe prices seemed high for the quality of the food The service was friendly and especially attentive with the water  The bread was warm and good too Id go back for drinks and light apps but not for dinner,?
1390644,Got a 1/2 rack of ribs and I must say it is fresh and perfect  Couldnt ask for better ribs  come right off the bone and juicy  Loved it!!!Pretty bad ass and we will be going back for more Only recommendation    try making there own BBQ sauce to stand out ,?
1390655,Got a 14 pizza with extra sauce and buttery crust  We are picky with pizza and this place did not let is down  The crust is amazing  The sauce is more of a sweeter style sauce and is very good  The tiramisu for a pizza joint was not bad either! Will be back for sure ,?
1391340,Got a coffee  grilled cheese  and stayed for an afternoon working  Great coffee  delicious grilled cheese  and awesome place to work ,?
1391512,Got a cupcake here when I attended Chow Down Uptown  I believe the one I ordered was called Elvis  It was a banana flavored cupcake  with peanut butter icing that was very fluffy with bacon on top  The combinations of all the flavors was amazing  I really should have started with Cupcake Delirium upon arriving at Chow Down so I could have had  more than one  I really look forward to visiting the truck again in the near future ,?
1394205,Got appetizer fried beef jerky  Fantastic Got chicken katsu with peanut sauce and paid a lil extra for the chili sauce also   Very good chicken    didnt care for the peanut sauce just a lil to spicy for me  (Im a lightweight on spice) but I loved it with the chili sauce  The Mac salad it comes with is amazing  The owner and owners son were absolutely the friendliest owners I have ever met  They alone show how customer service should be  This is pretty far from where I live and we came based on yelp      We were not disappointed!!! Will be back!!! Aloha,?
1395556,Got in early  11am and it was quiet  Place is clean  staff friendly   food arrived fast and is good Was served a small bowl of soup noodles as appetizer and yogurt drink as dessert Great place for quick Korean craving!,?
1395617,Got in late one night so I gave this place a try  Cool place with dining outside right next to one of the pools  I had the chicken club with fries  Nothing special  The fries were great  The bacon was outstanding  ( yes  I love bacon that much  and yes outstanding was the word)  Beer was cold  the fireball was not?? She did offer to chill it though  Ill be back  There was a ton of stuff on the menu I want to try ,?
1395754,Got into a bad wreck on my Gary Fisher Mountain bike  Bent the derailer and rear rim  They set me up with a new rim  They also fixed my derailer and a loose pedal for no extra charge  Also bought a new seat from them  Great people to deal with and they really know their stuff  They were super friendly and very quick on their service  I highly recommend them to anyone  P S  Check out their Cafe  Really good food ,?
1396172,Got my MAHARLIKA tattoo done by Ryan Maynard  Im 100% satisfied! Thanks Ryan keep up the good work!,?
1397181,Got my mothers iPhone 6plus repaired at this store could not be more pleased  Not just because of the great workmanship on the repair but the customer service and general feeling from beginning to end was fantastic  Plus the repair was very fast and affordable for the damage to the phone  Highly recommend to any and everyone!!!,?
1397202,Got my nails done a week ago and theyre falling off    this is the second time so i wont be returning,?
1397348,Got my new glasses from Lenscrafters cos of the 50% lenses sale (which periodically happens throughout the year)   The manager came to help me pick a pair for my prescription   She ran around the store and finally found me a few pairs that fit my presciption and my face shape to try on   Finally settled on a pair   My lenses cost a fortune cos Im halfblind!  So  I always wait for the 50% lenses sales If you get a pair from Lenscrafters and didnt like it  you have 30 days from date of purchase to exchange for another pair or get a refund   Also  if you got a pair  you could also get free adjustments  free nose pads  new screws anytime   Also  did you know that as a member of AMA you can get 30% of the whole pair?,?
1397830,Got new windshield today for my 98 Honda Accord  $100  They got it installed and had me on my way in less than 30 mins !  Clean install with no black caulk to clean up from the headliner and pillars like from other places Ive used in the past   Highly Recommend them !,?
1397935,Got one of the bowls which was very good  but a bit pricey  Basically a smoothie with fruit slices  granola and agave nectar on top  Taste alone it was 5 stars  but for $8 it is 4 stars ,?
1398452,Got seated right away   Nice place with a good mix of spring training folks and snow birds   The parking lot leaves a lot to be desired Service was prompt and pleasant   Ordered a Mexican skillet and a side of a pancake   Skillet was rock solid and the black beans are a nice touch along with the texture of the diced potatoes   Salsa and verde were great too   The tortilla leaves a lot to be desired   Small and generically store bought   Tasted like a cheap Mission tortilla Which leads to now two days in a row of a pancake that was cold   The butter in this case was only slightly melted    Pancake was good   Itll be nice to see what its like warm   The place is a bit out of the way  unless youre in south Gilbert/Queen Creek but its pleasant   Ill be back and will hope that their glasses get larger   The carafe of your drink is a nice way to compensate though ,?
1399799,Got the Loco tacos  Not nearly enough seafood in the tacos and the beans and rice were in tiny side cups  Tasted good but not enough fish ,?
1399822,Got the Margarita with prosciutto added and the Settebello  Both were delicious  Dough is perfect in crunchiness and chewiness  Ordered for take out  they said 15 mins wait time but it was a lot quicker  Ill be back  My new goto pizza place in Henderson ,?
1400113,Got the baby spice Shrimp & snow crab legs  I cant tolerate very spicy food & the baby spice was killer for me  The waiter asked what I was drinking & never brought my drink  I asked for sweet rolls & I waited 15 mins  they arrived at the end of my meal  I told her I no longer wanted them  The service sucked but the food was good  On the fence if Ill be back,?
1400118,Got the bacon cheeseburger large  Very good taste  patties a little thin but slightly dripping and mediumrare to medium cooked  Perfect for me  Nice bun  not hard or dry  Skimped on the lettuce and tomato  if those matter to you  Sauce was  decent  I give the burger a solid 4 5 Onion rings  while not bad  were thin and only numbered six medium rings  $4 45 a little too much for the amount  3 / on taste  1 5 on generously Since first visit  got the free small cup of PBR draft  But since Im leaving here still hungry  Im giving it 3 03 5  Get the extra large burger if you want to be sure to be full ,?
1400491,Got the chicken sandwich  It was okay  Kind of plain  Not enough sauce  Need to change the type of bun used  the current one just falls apart  The actual chicken piece was a good amount and tasted good The skinny bartender girl  didnt know how to make an old fashioned  She put sweet vermouth in it  I immediately noticed from the taste  asked if she could make it again without it  she said yes  It was the sweetest old fashioned I have ever had  I couldnt drink it  I didnt even bother asking for another drink  Could have just asked how to make it  instead of trying to guess  Just saying ,?
1400500,Got the chicken strips  fries  and mushrooms it was delicious! Also got banana pudding and loved it all!,?
1400650,Got the deal on here and got the hook up right from the start  Alejandro got me a beer (free beer always works) and made me feel welcome  and barber Tim did a great job on my hair and really seemed to know his stuff  The straight razor line up felt great and was a nice bonus on a already great job  Will return for my next haircut and beyond ,?

1401941,Got the turkey Reuben    Wrong bread cold fries   Told the bartender it was my husbands birthday he ignored me because he was  busy   Manager could have stepped up as well   Not happy:(,?
1402392,Got there at opening expecting to walk around   They pretty much had to kick us out at five and we never even had lunch   took in Women who Rock and quite a bit of the rest  but never got through the whole second floor  because there was just so much to see   Truly exceptional collection and just an outstanding facility   I especially enjoyed the giant mechanical orchestra they played for us and the very interesting artist gallery   Wish I did not live so far away  but I will do a make up visit asap   A bit priceytickets were $25 each with the women special exhibitbut well worth it ,?
1403142,Got to see Rob Schneider here and what a nice theater! I have lived here 20 years and have seen Rich Little in his theatre but didnt even realize this gem was here  Great sound system  nice clean place with big movie theatre style chairs that are SO comfy with their specialized head rest    just lets you lay your huge noodle back at the perfect angle and enjoy the laughs!

1403379,Got to use another myVegas reward! 1 free crepe! I got the savory salmon one! Unfortunately it was made with cold  smoked salmon  and not much of it  But it was still pretty good It had a great white sauce and lots of veggies like mushrooms and spinach  I really only ate until I had finished all the salmon they put on top  which was only like maybe 68 bites  at most  It was made from a buckwheat crepe which was cool  The guy was also super nice! And we got to watch them make it We also tried some samples of the gelato  pretty good  We were sold on the oreo one  Yum!,?
1403677,Gotham City Comics is a very family friendly place  It has a very wide variety of comics and merchandise  They also have weekly events  such as Game Night  or Doctor Who Night  I personally attend Doctor Who Night with my family  They also have amazing beverages such as coffee  tea  hot chocolate  and some can sodas  Starbucks employees once bought their Chai Tea claiming it to be better than their own  The employees of Gotham are also very friendly  and they are perfectly happy to help you out should you require their services   All in all I really love this place  I feel very comfortable there  and I love the general atmosphere of the place ,?
1404736,Gotta say    I absolutely LOVE the Frank Sinatra Calzone !!! Been eating here for years now and I just have to say the Food is delicious   The Manager Angel Rojas ??

1405332,Grabagreen is a hit! This wholefood  gluten free option was impressive  Basically  you can order a predetermined dish or you can pick your ingredients  I had quinoa  shrimp  avocado  red bell pepper  kale  feta  and the avocado sauce  It was delicious  I also had to try a smoothie  In this case  I went with a prelisted option: Look Lucious  The flavored were right on  The style of this establishment is quick and easy  order at the counter style  They put your order in a little box regardless so you can eat in or out  Its not very big but there are several outdoor tables too  Ill be back!,?
1405430,Grabbed a coffee here today with a couple friends  Had an Iced Toddy  which is their iced coffee  It was fabulous! Cool atmosphere  I loved the decor and local art  Will definitely stop by next time I am in Tempe and have a craving for some coffee  :),?

1405975,Grace is fantastic!!! She is professional  talented  and great with kids (she is a mom  so she gets it)  We booked a mini session with her  and I had hoped to get maybe one decent family picture out of it  There were so many great shots that it was hard for me to choose! My 4 year old is in an antipicture phase  so I just warned her in advance not say things like smile or let me take your picture and she totally listened to me and was able to get great shots of him anyway  Like I said  she gets it  :) She got lots of creative shots with our baby as well  Her style is sort of a mix of posed and candid shots  She gives a bit of direction  but isnt at all overbearing  I will happily book her for another family shoot in the future  Highly recommend!,?
1405997,Grace was so friendly and helpful! Pretty spacious inside  coffee/beverages provided  and pleasant atmosphere!,?
1407110,Granted  I was going to be using a free drink coupon to compensate for our unused resort fees at Excalibur  however I was not waving it in the air yelling Im cheap! or anything   My mom and I got annoyed because we sat at the bar when it was not crowded for 12 minutes before someone finally came over   Well  we MAY have tipped better if he cared enough to not walk past us 5 times I got a bottled beer (no watering THAT down!) and my mom got a glass of sparking wine   Both were exactly what we thought theyd be   But since we were looking to drink again after our freebie  we went back to Excalibur and bought drinks at Sherwood Bar instead   Our service was amazing  even with our free drink coupons ,?
1407272,Grass was beautiful  carts were nice  wasnt tough  but I dont think it deserves minus points for that   The only problem I had with it was the greens (while in GREAT shape) werent cut short and rolled so they were really slow very unlike a professional course   not sure why people give it a 2 with nothing REALLY bad to say about it   ,?
1407710,Greasiest muffins Ive ever hadcould not even finish them they were that gross   Thoroughly unfriendly staff   I know people like this place because its independent and all  but I feel I must judge based on its merits ,?
1407834,Greasy goodness on the Danforth!Always a lineup means great food!Tiny booths always available because most do takeout   ,?

I ordered an ultimate margarita on the rock without salt    The Margaritas here are really good! After about three of the ultimate one  I started to feel really good! Have to love the liquid courage! HAHAOff the menu you I ordered the mini chimis  the beef ones  The meet was very delicious  and the sides were very nicely arranged  My overall experience here was really good! Next time I return here  I think Ill try the beergartita  and the enchiladas ,?

1410524,Great Chinese food at a great price in North Phoenix They have a coupon you cant beat  Free Entree after spending $18  The free entree is a limited selection but when you can get 3 entrees and an appetizer for $20 youre doing great   Big portions that always leave left overs We have eaten here twice for pick up and been very satisfied   Only negative thing I can say is that my wife was disappointed with her chow mein/ crunchy noodles  as the noodles were not what she was expecting   We called the resaurant to ask about it and the owner explained that thats what they were supposed to be   they werent wrong  but she wasnt exactly concerned with correcting our disappointment in the meal (was hoping that maybe shed offer some noodles/rice?  Not her fault that wed never had crunchy noodles  so still gets 5 stars We will definitely be back  but ALWAYS have the coupon  its on their menu ,?
1411072,Great Customer Service!  Told the gentleman that I unexpectedly had to travel to AZ and just needed a relatively  small pipe and not to expensive   He didnt try to push anything I obviously didnt ask for and it is greatly appreciated!

1413982,Great Irish Pub! Went here for dinner over the Memorial Day weekend and it was delicious  Nice atmosphere and staff  We got Magners Hard Cider  which they had on draft (FANTASTIC)  The fish and chips were huge! I am not a fish person but had a bite and it was very tasty! The batter was delicious  I ordered the pork chop with the Magners cider glaze and it was fantastic  Mashed potatoes and asparagus on the side  This is a pub  so dont expect it to be quiet ;) there was live music and a basketball game of sorts going on at the time and there was quite a lot of loud cheering  But if youre looking for a place with terrific food near the Luxor area  Id say give this place a shot ,?
1415075,Great Location  Friendly enough staff  Clean enough Room  Noisy overnight  tough to sleep with all the noise Had my CC lifted 20 minutes after I checked in and the card was locked until I arrived at the hotel to check in and 10 minutes after check in  pretty sketchy Will never stay here again,?

1415634,Great Mexican food! The chips arent greasy and the salsa was fresh  spicy and flavorful  They give you both regular and spicy salsa to start  You can ask for tasty green salsa too  I had the steak fajitas and they were cooked perfectly  All ingredients were fresh and seasonings were on point  22oz beer was on special for only $3 when I visited  Will be coming back soon!,?

1417836,Great Salon with great customer service! Just relocated to Charlotte and found out about this Salon on Yelp and theyre definitely worth going to if you want to get pampered! Anytime I request an appointment through Yelp I get a response right back   A young lady by the name of S did my pedicure and was amazing (see you in 2 wks S)! I will always be requesting S and I cant remember the lady name who did my nails but she was great too!! Its not a gimmick this place is great as well as the Customer Service!!,?

1418477,Great Service  Great Food they served up a my daughters graduation party! There wasnt a complaint in the house!,?
1419164,Great Steak and Seafood here!! Pricey  but you get what you pay for! This is Vegas  the one thing you DONT Want to gamble with  is your food/health  Dont take the risk of a huge buffet (with stale seafood  or worse!) I never worry about getting sick eating here  very upscale and quiet  Fresh bread served with your drinks and the Chop Salad is great!! I had the Chicken Dumpling Soup (last time) because I didnt feel very well and it was delicious!! My boyfriend and I always look forward to eating a nice dinner here when were in Vegas (Aliante Hotel) and its always been wonderful ,?
1419168,Great Steak house ! Pricing isnt bad      location is not the best but worth it      would have given a higher rating but had a couple parties complain while i was here but the service for me was fine and i ordered the NY strip and it was good      i will come back and next time i may give a higher rating !!,?
1419803,Great Thai food off the strip  lots of parking   I had dinner and lunch here on my recent trip to Vegas  the food is fresh and crisp and clean  tasting   not heavy on the sauce  Affordable as well  highly recommend if you enjoy traditional Thai food  also have some non traditional items on the menu ,?

1421162,Great affordable pho had the #17 also was tasty but not worth the price  The banh mi sandwich could use more pork but was tasty  Will come Be back for pho only,?
1422216,Great ambiance  great location in Old Montreal We had an early dinner/late lunch  there was no one in the place so we were worried it was closed   Although in order to walk through the door  I had to almost physically move 23 guys outside smoking directly in the doorway   This kind of thing makes me crazy  especially because it wasnt snowing/raining  so why they had to hover (and force me to walk through the cloud) in the doorway is bizarre  and really not classy However  once inside things were better   I had the mushroom risotto and it was REALLY good with fresh wild mushrooms   Yum!  We also started with the appetizer sampler   The wine was good  service was OK ,?
1422544,Great ambience and delicious coffee  The staff is genuinely friendly and this place was very busy for a Friday morning! Im visiting my parents from the east coast and I will definitely be coming back to this place a bunch before I head home ,?
1422778,Great ambience  great food  Im so glad Downtown Davidson has added so many quality restaurants   Whenever you are in the area  be sure to make a reservation so you can grab a meal ,?
1423154,Great and environment and even better food! The employees are all very friendly our waiter Sean and one of the servers Marcos N were outstanding  I definitely recommend it ,?
1423214,Great and fast service  Never a wait for dinner  Every time we have gone for dinner there were only a couple other people there so it is always quiet  It is typical Mexican food    Large quantities  They even have a section of the menu for the less adventurous amigos aka hamburgers and chicken nuggets  Its not a gourmet restaurant  but I have never had any complaints ,?
1423324,Great and friendly staff ready to serve you  along with good happy hour deals from 37 on weekdays as well average deals 11am4 on weekends  Spacious  it has shuffle board and a pool table with a nice long bar to complement it all ,?
1423582,Great and tasty meat! Superb place off the touristic LV strip  The ribs and the Brisket were perfectly cooked  The outlaw burger was huge but had all the flavours it needed  We will for sure visit this place again on our next visit in Sin City :),?
1423865,Great architecture and trendy ambiance  Fresh oysters served with vinegar were tasteful  When it arrived  the braised lamb shank was cold  Miso cod  which came half floating in an asian soup was good  They offer an exhaustive wine list which is interesting  I had a delicious IP (private importation) white Marsannay  Service and food were in general good  not the best though Maybe a bit overrated?Id say 3 1/2 stars ,?
1423889,Great area to walk  chill  picnic  etc  Love taking photographs during Spring  Summer & Fall  Winter  not so much  Like fountains? They got you  Intricate pathways? Got em  Theres a dude on a horse!I want to give it 5Stars  the Night Market attempt is like the equivalent of a TV Movie; less to do  less to spend  and it ENDS BEFORE NIGHT!That last bit is unacceptable having been to Vancouvers actual Night Market  at night  And while I realize the Park itself may have nothing to do with said choices  Im revoking a Star based on audacity and association alone  (Seems more like a job for the Stampede Grounds  just saying)Then Im going to see if this Night Market has a Yelp page (do Events have Yelp pages? Lets find out together!)  and review that GRated attempt accordingly ,?
1424495,Great atmosphere and concept  Loved the decor and theme of the restaurant and the food was good  You MUST try the desert  the fried ice cream was absolutely incredible! I ate there during a work trip to the RNC  over a month ago  and just remembered that I never wrote a review  The service was good ,?
1424948,Great atmosphere and great food! Service was friendly and quick and the food was fresh and flavorful  My personal favorite was the Las Vegas roll but Ill definitely be back to try more rolls ,?

1425364,Great atmosphere and service  Was s little disappointed with the chimichanga  it was beautiful but lacked the flavor I expected  Everyone else enjoyed their meals  the blue corn dish was a fave! Ill be back to try something else  Great place for kids and dogs  the patio is gorgeous!,?
1425469,Great atmosphere and the place to be on a cool fall Phoenix night  They have tons of games to entertain anyone of all ages and you must get the soft pretzels and provolone fondue!!!! Out  Of  This  World ,?
1426000,Great atmosphere inside  st marks square at the venetian  Very expensive for what you get  but you almost get numb to the expense in Vegas  Everything is expensive  I dont mind paying the price if you get payback with a great product  In this case you dont  The service was pretty good but the food when it arrived was less than adequate  The salad was not my taste  almost like they threw it together with what they had left over  In now my calfs liver was not bad  Ive had better and worse so middle of the road would best describe it  Of course at these prices middle of the road is unacceptable  My wife ordered a bone in rib eye which she ordered medium well so she got it burnt like a charcoal briquette  The kicker it was tasteless  Really a total waste time of a meal  Not worth it  Avoid if possible,?
1426607,Great atmosphere! The pain killer is a pina colada on steroids!  Not frozen but delicious!  Come try this cool old town Scottsdale location    The Ahi poke is a must!  Forgot to take a picture cause the food looked so amazing I had to eat it!,?

1429078,Great atmosphere  Ordered mini spicy miso ramen and deep fried octopus tentacles  Ramen was amazing  Broth was flavourful and rich  Pork was cooked better than other supposed Michelin ramen places  The free appetizer spicy bean sprouts were amazing! Super friendly staff  Definitely a goto spot for ramen in toronto!,?
1429386,Great atmosphere; great food and of course the cheesecake is amazing  Went for lunch and there wasnt any wait time  Host and Wait staff was amazing and friendly  I love Mexican food and I decided to get the factory burrito and it was huge and tasty  Plus after you have a great lunch  visit the mall for some retail therapy  then come back to Cheesecake Factory for your cheesecake to go ,?
1429954,Great authentic Vietnamese food  They really know how to make everything from the meats/salads to the soups  I always end up getting banh coun or banh xeo because there are not many other restaurants in AZ that even offer these dishes  Water cup is always full and they have the shrimp paste that you find in Vietnam  They have amazing eggrolls and spring rolls if you want something small  Prices are good and the place is always busy  Must try!,?
1430891,Great bar food! Excellent fries and onion rings  very good salads  focaccias and pizza  Good atmosphere too!,?
1431221,Great bar! Food is always consistent and good  Staff is amazing and friendly  Nice  neighborhood bar atmosphere  Come in and ask for Timmy!,?
1431970,Great bbq joint  You cant ask for better service  I can honestly say that if you ordered an appetizer  it may come after your meal   Or it would force them to not give you your food right away  Ordered  then took a deep breath  followed by a blink of the eye and BOOM!! Foods here! I compliment our waiter for messing up our order and bringing us the wrong side because he ended up bringing us the side that we actually ordered and let us keep the other   That was deserving of generous tip for the nice fellow  Great BBQ  Better Service ,?
1432127,Great beef bowl and ramen place  Perhaps the first in the GTA  so nice to see a Japanese restaurant that offers something other than poor sushi and frozen fish labelled as sashimi  The beef bowl tastes authentic and the ramen was also great  They just opened so there are not that many customers thus the service was fantastic  Would definitely recommend to people who seek comfort food straight from Japan in the GTA area ,?
1433136,Great beer selection  Not so great staff  The language from several waitresses  as they came and went from the bar and kitchen area was frat house  hanging with your friends crude  Tall and thin Girl with curly black hair was the instigator  We sat at the bar trying to enjoy our drinks and left after one  I will say the bartender was very knowledgeable and helpful  We didnt eat during this visit and probably wont go back based on what we heard and saw  Behavior like this has no place in a restaraunt ,?
1433235,Great beer! Favorite place so far in PHX  The service is on point meaning its friendly  informative  and service oriented  The environment is laid back and just friendly  Reminds me of the show cheers  I will def be back and will recommend to anyone that asks ,?
1433260,Great beer! They have a small list of beers but what they have it well made  Flights available  it seems like whole in the wall area but once you get in there its worth it  There jasmine green tea beer and coffee jomax beer is phenomenal  The sour was berry sour was also good bc it wasnt too sweet which I liked  Its not a very bigPlace so hard to find a seat if youre with a big crowd and would be awesome if they had an outdoor patio/ set up area but overall good beer decent price !,?
1433757,Great beers  terrible service  My friend and I stopped in for a few beers on a Saturday night and the female bartender couldnt be bothered  Every time I wanted to order I had to get up and go over to her as she was chatting up the other bartender  We were sitting AT THE BAR  Sad because the place is super cool with a great selection ,?
1434706,Great breakfast burrito  friendly staff and amazing coffee! Love coming here!! Perfect if youre in a hurry and need something fast and tasty to go or sit outside and enjoy your coffee!,?

1435704,Great breakfast venue  The staff are friendly and professional  quick service  Food is hot and delicious!,?
1435772,Great breakfast!  I just had the egg basket and it was not only delicious but it had a great presentation   The waiter was friendly and informative   This place is known to be VERY BUSY    expect a wait if youre going during peak business hours    I went on a Monday morning and it was wide open ,?
1435875,Great breakfast! Ordered the Dublin Benedict with grits  and it was great  Potatoes & onions were perfect  as was the bread  Nothing terribly unique  but each item done right Drive by and youll think no way  Walk in and its unassuming  But you wont be disappointed And service was nice  She was busy  but come on  its not a factory  its people ,?
1436676,Great brunch options   6 Bloody Marys   What more could you want   Friendly staff and knowledgeable bartenders ,?

1439235,Great burgers  Great fries  Great Local craft beer selection  Great shakes  Great staff!  Jessica was an awesome server  She was very friendly and had great customer service!  Thanks for a enjoyable evening!  We will be back!!,?
1439281,Great burritos and they serve beer!!However compared to the one by UNLV (Maryland and Harmon) its not as good  They hook it up with Guacamole over there  big portions and if you show your student ID you get a free drink  Bad ass  Still this place is great if you dont want Mall food or other crap near by  Oh and the price is not marked up at all even though its on the strip ,?
1439295,Great burritos! My husband made a comment that the chorizo was some of the best hes had! We ordered take out and the only down side was they forgot to include our chips and salsa that we paid for ,?
1439332,Great business and customer service   Prompt and quick repairs   Highly recommend this company  ,?
1439460,Great butcher with meat from animals raised locally (I think they have a farm near Waxhaw)  All their animals are free range with no steroids  hormones etc    They can get you hard to find cuts and specialty meats  Been going their for a while when I want to make that extra special meal or need that German cut of top round  Service is always nice and knowledgeable ,?
1439906,Great car wash  looks like a brand new car every time after it is done  You get what you pay for here  Dont like taking my car anywhere else ,?
1440110,Great casino we won $200 in one night!! They also have a nightclub and friendly waitresses that bring free drinks while you play  This isnt unique to this casino only  but it is pretty cool ,?
1440338,Great catfish!!! Will definitely be back soon  The salad bar was good as well  Many days they have specials so call ahead and ask ,?
1442225,Great cocktails  comfortable atmosphere  tasty food Ive always enjoyed the Brocach  and feel the new look helps set them apart from some of the others around the square   The menu has just enough selection to make a night enjoying a few drinks feel comfortable without getting overwhelmed with choices   One of my top picks for warming up on a cold winter evening or meeting friends downtown ,?
1442268,Great cocktails   Pleasant stuff   Food not quite my thing  but Id definitely go back for the bar ,?
1442417,Great coffee and atmosphere! I normally drink black coffee so I stick to iced americanos  but I have tried the dirty chai and evil monkey  All 3 have been very good so Im excited to branch out and try other speciality drinks  Free WiFi and plenty of seating  so its a great place to get a little work done or just relax while enjoying your drink or pastries They also have happy hour pricing  but not sure if it depends on the day or if this all the time  Drivethru is 24/7 ,?
1442522,Great coffee and flavor combinations  loyalty punch card and a drive thru that is quick   Yes  please   Very cool atmosphere inside to lounge and get some work done   They also have a really good happy hour   Their Cafe Au Lait is the best Ive had outside of New Orleans   My only caution would be that their coffee drinks run hella sweet   I get them 1/4 sweet and thats definitely enough ,?
1442557,Great coffee and friendly staff! We went there after dinner so we didnt try any of the food  but maybe we will the next we are passing through town ,?
1442589,Great coffee and great conversations  They have alternatives for people who are nondairy  And I love the Harry Potter theme of this place!!,?

1443655,Great coffee  great tea  and delicious food   Tried Matcha latte  and lets say its different  Be adventurous and give it a try  though ,?
1443816,Great coffee   Cute  tasteful set up   Sinfully rich dessert   Come for a break; you deserve a glimpse of European R&R The 1star deduction is because they changed the opening hours unannounced   The operating hours on weekend have been shortened sometime in summer 2015   To this date  the new hours are not posted at store  or printed on its business card  or posted on website and Facebook ,?
1444104,Great comedy show! Def a must see! I would so see him again! Carrot top is hilarious and def made me laugh so hard I thought Id pee myself!

1445558,Great concept  great people  Ive been fortunate to see this go from a couple of notes on a whiteboard to an established business with a small fleet of carts rolling around uptown today  Expanding a bit on the Facebook business model free services through advertising funding they have made quite the impact on Charlottes inner city transportation  without an impact on the environment (electric carts)  Their service is provided at nearly all major sporting events  as well as many others  Most of the guys involved in driving the carts I know personally  definitely friendly and personable  Im looking forward to getting my ride on here soon  Congrats guys Dont forget to tip your driver!,?
1446581,Great cup of Columbian filter coffee   DittoThai salad and zucchini & goat cheese scone Kudos to PHX airport officials for promoting high q locals  Great people at cartel disturbing to see big line at star$    & no line here ,?
1447257,Great customer service and great cookies  what more could you ask for? The staff was very patient  and knowledgeable about their products  The staff member I spoke to gave me a great suggestion for a new type of cookie to try  The cookies I got had just came out the oven and paired nicely with the cold 2%milk  So nostalgic!,?

Today I was in line ordering a salad   They didnt have the lettuce ready so I told them I would wait and they can help the other customers in line   I only waited a few minutes  they helped about 3 or 4 customers until they got back to me   I finished my order when it was time to pay  they told me my order was on the house since I had to wait!  Extremely nice of them ,?

1450955,Great date night spot! The atmosphere is warm  dark and cozy  The food was delicious  We ordered a smoked fish (forget which fish but a fish nonetheless) crustini which was delicious  I definitely recommend the vegetarian Shepards pie  it was super tasty  creative and unlike anything else Ive tasted! Fish and chips was good (thick homemade fries) but youre better off ordering something unique Service was great  Friendly  Wine list was extensive  All in all about $100 for 2 entres  1 app and one of the cheaper bottles of wine ,?
1451075,Great day  great massage  and a customer service issue made right by Spa Director Stevie  Long story short  called in and was told about the Tuesday Twos Company deal    Perfect for my wife and I to get massaged  Was quoted a price  After an awesome day  my bill was much  much higher than what the reservations agent (Steven?) quoted me Stevie  the Director  took me at my word and gave me the quoted price  It was worth every penny  Thank you for making it right  and thank you to everyone for an outstanding day ,?
1451431,Great deals but bathrooms are pretty dirty compared to other TJ Maxx locations   Just like any other location they have several deals to choose from I usually buy my dog toys and accessories from here due to the major discount   They even have some designer clothing and purses you can choose from   I remember coming here and getting my gym bag for 15$ when they are usually much more   I even got converse here for 20$ when people know they are normally 30$ and up with discounts  Some of their hair products are cheap too! I usually pay 10$ and up for my dry shampoo in which they have it here for 5 99$ which I cant complain about If you look around here you can find some really good deals on a lot of things  Try not to come here if youre in a rush because you could possibly miss the deal of a lifetime!,?
1451453,Great deals here and love browsing at the unique bottle selection from all over the world ,?

Lots of choices  Would like to see avocado as a topping choice and pico de gallo too  Would also like to see foot long hot dog as a choice  Dirty jerz was yum  Enjoyed the white hot though still prefer zwigels as a fave  Was excited about hand cut fries but they were beyond crispy and dry and we like them crisp  Will go back again  Nice to know the dogs and sausages are gluten free ,?

The chicken egg rolls were the best Ive had  I always say: you can tell how good a Chinese restaurant is by their egg rolls  Wow  this place ranks high because their egg rolls are so very tasty  Ive actually never had any other food here  just each kind of egg roll they serve  If you go here  you must get the egg rolls!,?
1455282,Great environment and excellent servicing to customers  Well lit making it perfect lighting and enough to fit alot of parties  Food is overpriced for the portion youre getting  The average Chinese restaurant is cheaper with same quality taste  Will give a second try ,?

1456145,Great experience after having had a horrid one at Mastros Ocean Club  I had the Wellington  Ramsays signature dish  It didnt disappoint  Wife and son had sirloin steaks  as I recall  My only gripe was the music   it wafts in from the bar and its not really appropriate for a relaxing dinner at a fine steak house  But the food was A! And I was a skeptic   figured Ramsay was probably an overrated TV personality   but he can execute a restaurant  no doubt ,?

1480794,Great food  Slow serviceTheir food is fresh  flavorful  and healthy  Definitely one of the best healthfood restaurants Ive been to  Unfortunately  their service is lacking quite a bit  I ordered ToGo (before the rush) and sat for over 30 minutes waiting for my food  By the time I got it  it was already cold  Pretty disappointing given that one of the reasons I eat fresh is so I dont have to deal with soggy  old food ,?
1481554,Great food  bad attitudes at this location  Hardly makes it worth it ,?
1481980,Great food  byob  and healthy! I went here on a weekday evening  We brought our own beers and they supplied a bottle opener and glasses  The service was great  very attentive  We drew with the crayons on the tablecloths  They have a unique seating area where some of the seating is along these long benches with some pillows  Hard to explain  It would have been nice to have some dimmers on the lights since we were there around 7 and it was dark outside  But I dont think they are quite finished decorating yet  We got the chips and salsa and the salsa was very fresh and a kinda pico  Then I had the ropa vieja  It is kind of like a naked burrito  It was very good  It came with plantains too but I wasnt a fan of those so the bf ate them  The bf got a zucchini salad that he said was really good but also small  I looked at the facebook page  http://www facebook com/Helveticajuicebar  and wow I am going to have to try one of those crepes and juice!,?

1487487,Great food  reasonable prices  and friendly staff  Just wish they would add more coffee selections  they just have instant coffee  though youre probably better off ordering one of their healthy drinks instead of coffee :),?
1487822,Great food  service  & atmosphere! I love their Farmers Market Benedict  with avocado and breakfast potatoes  yum! They have a pet friendly patio but it is fast casual so you have to order at the counter  luckily they have a bar outside you can order food from too!,?

1492818,Great food   everything Ive eaten here (breakfast  lunch  dinner) has been great   I enjoy eating here but the reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is the service   Until today  the previous 3 visits I sat for the longest time with an empty tea glass or coffee cup  multiple waitstaff walk by your empty glass and unless you are their table  nobody just offers a refill unless you ask   Today I had the BEST service Ive yet to have at this restaurant  her name was Bri and I didnt sit with an empty glass at all  that made me happy   Funny thing to note: today is Bris birthday and HER 1ST DAY AS A WAITRESS    Great job Bri  you are off to a wonderful start ,?
1492829,Great food   got a gift card   used it and the food was great! Plan on going back again sometime im the near future ,?
1494267,Great for the games and a draft beer  But other than their wings and onion rings  nothing else is worth spending your $$ on  Besides  their prices are a bit on the high end for dry and tasteless food  As I said before  I go for the games and draft beer  Rarely do I order anything aside from wings    If you go  dont expect good food ,?
1494550,Great fresh burger that Im not supposed to be eating (paleo)  but they are as close to that backyard grilled burger as it gets with just about everything youd like to put on it  Nothing else I saw on the menu makes this place stand out  The downside or upside (depending on your budget philosophy) is that they are an all cash business  We had two burgers  two fries and a drink which came to $23 ,?
1495078,Great friendly and professional staff  Amazing property   modern amenities  the grounds of the hotel had lots of greenery  a kid friendly pool  and most rooms have balcony or patio,?

1500120,Great hole in the wall place! Free parking in the area is a plus  I dont know if I would go here for some of the other asian dishes that are boasted (didnt try them)  but stuck to the handmade noodles  the Chinese items on the menu  Tried the special beef noodle soup as well as a dumpling/wonton with egg noodle soup  Of note  the dumplings and wontons either looked exactly alike or I didnt get one of them (it was filled with shrimp and minced pork though  which was pretty tasty)  They were simple  but satisfying for a cold snowy day and the price point was extremely reasonable  Just a note  that this is more of a holeinthe wall authentic place so it would not be where to go to get that greasy lomein that you just sometimes crave  Again  for way under $10 an entree for the noodle soups  this is an excellent place  Ive seen/heard lots about the pork hock so maybe check that out if you have the chance ,?
1500981,Great hotel funny bag check experience no tag given Room clean Happy employees i luv how they remember my preferences from other four seasons hotels I will definitely return   great hotel period end of story ,?
1501198,Great hotel with very good breakfast and HUGE rooms  Th area is a bit dicey  WARNING: some rooms have doors connecting them to adjacent and the acoustic xfer will make you think you have unwanted roommates  I had to wear noise cancelling headphones to sleep  Request a room w/o such room joining doors or do not stay here  Other than this the hotel is clean  well maintained and great value ,?
1501712,Great hotel  You get a 5 star treatment for the price of a 2 star hotel! Most definitely recommend that place for anybody with a light wallet!,?
1501750,Great hours (7 am 11pm everyday!) and great personnel  They also have boarding and grooming in office  Ive been taking both my dogs here since 2010 and dont have a single complaint  I recently moved to N Scottsdale from old town and still go to this vet because they are so reliable ,?
1502375,Great idea  not good for you tho  Hahaha  My child had great choices until he put gummie bears on in  Lil pricy for the amount but not crazy  The wild unruly kids running around like their lil butts were on fire is a lil annoying tho  Not the stores fault  just bad parenting    The line was crazy behind us musta got here in time  This place is always packed whn we drive by tho ,?
1502705,Great info  easy to follow  made my time so worth while  I made new contacts and received clarity to questions  I already referred a friend and will come back for next recertification ,?

1504853,Great little secret cafe serving up tasty sandwiches right next to the Rosedale subway station  I tried out their pulled pork sandwich and it was heaven   I felt like I needed to crawl afterwards as I was incredibly full The sandwiches seem expensive but once you realize they give you 3 hours of fuel it becomes cheap ,?
1505535,Great little breakfast place  Fast service  warm food  good prices  & none of that generic big box restaurant chain feel  :),?
1505725,Great little cafe! The barista was lovely she asks how you like your coffee as she knows people can be picky! I had an ice coffee and a tuna sandwich  would recommend both though the sandwich was a little soggy Only a handful of tables inside so I had it to go!,?

1506857,Great little hotel in Montreal  nice breakfast and staff were all very helpful! Charming  comfortable  would stay again!,?
1507781,Great little place in Schenley Plaza  Im sure it will be even better once it cools off a bit and you can take advantage of the outdoor seating  As others have noted  service was a bit slowmy draft beer came shortly after we ordered  but my friends coffee had to be requested halfway through the meal since it still hadnt shown up  I had the pork sandwich  which was pretty good  If I go back I will definitely try one of the woodfired pizzas  which looked delicious  All in all it was good  but not great  I wouldnt hesitate to go back  but there are other places in the Oakland/Shadyside area that I would probably return to first ,?
1509053,Great little shop with various gift items and some clothing for women and men  They had amazing candles  dishtowels  stationary and knickknacks  They had wonderful necklaces too at a reasonable price  Im wishing now I had bought one I saw today! They even had some kid items and a really funny Barbie doll type of hanging lamp  It felt more like a shop Id see in Seattle  where I now live ,?

1509587,Great little spot! I would highly recommend this doughnut shop for anyone who needs a sweet fix! It has the variety like Pink Box donuts  but way better in my opinion  Their dough is so thick and practically melts in your mouth! Definitely will be coming back!,?
1509836,Great little sub shop  Stopped on our way through Cleveland and it was perfect  Theres no seating inside and very little parking outside  We just got it to go (which is the only way) and took our subs to the near by park and ate next to the lake  Good size subs and fries  we paid $12 for two people ,?
1510230,Great local Italian Restaurant  Great food with great prices Excellent selection with fresh ingredients  I enjoyed the antipasto  fennel salad to start  Mixed grill for my main and the Tiramisu to wrap it up  Match it with a bottle of wine we had an amazing night ,?

1513284,Great location on Fremont  cute atmosphere  friendly and knowledgeable staff and a great drink (plus beer) selection   This place was great!Its small  so I wouldnt suggest going with a large group   This is a great place to go and try creative cocktails  although I was also impressed with their decent selection of beers This is a great stop and wonderful addition to the ever changing East Fremont district ,?
1513551,Great location very convenient   Karen is very helpful and nice to work with   The property looks clean and well maintained with plenty security cameras ,?
1514066,Great location  but make sure you check in early! I checked in after 11pm on a wkday in June 10 and they didnt have a decent room available  I was put in a room for hearing impaired smokers! I had to wait until 2 pm the following day to be upgraded to a nicer room  The upgrade was amazing  but i was annoyed that i had to make sure i was back at my room early afternoon to change rooms  Other than that the hotel was OK  oh & the pool isnt anything too fancy ,?
1514083,Great location  but wayyy overpriced! For a Paradise Club Sandwich  small Southwestern Salad  and a cookie its 18 bucks! And thats not including a drink! Three stars for that reason  Other than that its always clean and the employees are always nice and welcoming ,?
1514382,Great location  great coach and great group of people  I first joined to learn judo  but I feel Im getting a lot more than I had expected Ive made many great friends here from all over the world  I hang out with my fellow Judokas outside of judo often too  Its interesting how international the members of this club are  We have members from Brazil  Bulgaria  Japan  Korea  Italy  Northern Ireland  Iran  Trinidad  Cuba  France  Czech Rep  China and of course Canada  plus more Sensei Miller places much emphasis on safety  mutual respect and growth  Of course Ive developed my judo as well as physical health  but I also find myself mentally a lot stronger and handling lifes challenges a lot better  Its hard to explain  but thats how I feel and my life is looking way better Regarding the kids classes  they certainly look really fun!,?
1514792,Great location  very busy!  The food and drinks were absolutely exceptional  They really lacked I service which was a big disappointment!  I will go back again and give it one more try  Its a shame because the food was so good!Barrio Queen reached out and we will be going back  update to follow but I changed my review stars because I know the service next time will be great and I know the food cant be better  I appreciate managements quick response too ,?
1515585,Great low calorie frozen yogurt! Prices are expensive for just frozen yogurt and the toppings are expensive also  If they cut the price id be back way more  Place is great and the customer service is good!,?
1515709,Great lunch brunch  Hidden off the main corridors of casino traffic  Get your French taste on!,?
1516366,Great lunch spot! See Candace at the bar   ,?
1516394,Great lunch spot  really yummy sandwich and very shareable ,?
1516800,Great mall with an incredible shrinking parking lot  With a new expansion comes some great new stores (Microsoft  which the Apple store has surprisingly relocated itself beside; Tesla Motors; a highend jeweller/watch store  and so forth) but the loss of probably a couple hundred prime parking spaces for a mall that is frequently busy and that becomes impossible to get even a spot at the very end of the lot during the holiday shopping season  With an adjacent subway station  that option is helpful as well  Valet parking is available  and frankly  Id like to know where they take the cars for my own reference   As mentioned by other reviewers  the stores range from lowmid end  e g  Old Navy  H&M  HMV  and Lenscrafters  to the extravagant  e g  the aforementioned Tesla Motors  Holt Renfrew  Bose  and Tiffany and Co   with a good collection of each and clearly including a number that arent found in your average neighbourhood mall ,?
1516845,Great mall  Need more elevators  more restrooms and what the hell  says you open at 10:00 am but the stores arent even open yet  This mall needs to get it together ,?
1517035,Great margaritas  Fabulous table side guacamole and fajitas and fried ice cream  Wonderful dinner experience ,?
1517122,Great martial arts instruction by black belt champion competitor Issa Able  and the camaraderie among training partners makes anyone feel welcome immediately  From beginners to experienced martial artists  youll find something of value from this gym The facility is kept clean  the training is intense and fun without the burden of traditional rituals  One Love is definitely one of the best places in the valley to train ,?
1517721,Great meal! Its expensive  of course  But the service was great and the food was also  I had the HK antioxidant which was very tasty  We got the chorizo stuffed lobster appetizer which I cant recommend  it was small and unexciting  We both ordered Wellingtons which were AMAZING  flaky crust  perfectly done  We also got the mac and cheese which was great and the sticky toffee pudding which was phenomenal  Would definitely come back next time we are here!,?
1517973,Great meat quality   came in late and it wasnt too busy so service was not a problem like in other reviews  Awesome cooooold japanese beer!,?
1519217,Great museum with all 7 floors dedicated to the artist  native to Pittsburgh I visited in 2012 and it seems quite a bit different than it did then so I like that a repeat visit will reveal something new to me   I especially liked one change in particular  a floor dedicated to his life as he grew up from report cards and pics of his youth all the way through his adulthood   It was a very nice personal touch and small glimpse into his life I missed seeing some of the pieces not on display  I would have liked very much to see Marilyn Monroe   Ali  and Jackie O pieces Two pieces deserved eyerolls  really  Andy?  You felt the need to use urine to create art?  really?  Whatev   definitely worth a visit ,?
1519719,Great nail salon; everyone is Englishspeaking so its a nice comfortable environment  They have two large TVs mounted behind the nail bar  and have a tv show or movie playing for entertainment  They take pride in sanitizing and disinfecting tools  workstations  pedicure tubs  chairs  They have a large selection of regular and gel polishes  as well as colored acrylics  glitters  3D charms  They can do tips or sculpted  acrylic or hard gel  along with regular or gel polish! You definitely get what you pay for  and these ladies do amazing custom work! You wont be disappointed!,?
1519824,Great neighborhood Greek spotNot too many choices for Greek food in the valley until Meraki showed up  Place is nice and welcomingFrom the outside in They have a full range of items from salads to gyros to desserts  They do fine in and Togo so if like me you can grab some tasty food on the go and not be disappointed  I decided to go with the Meraki gyro with beef and lamb  Fantastic  Everything was fresh and tasty and a great size of food!Employees are nice and are able to answer all the questions you have  There are no bad items on the menu so happy eating!!,?
1520256,Great neighborhood place thats been there forever! The staff is friendly and attentive and they pour a decent drink  The food is standard (cant go wrong with a grilled cheese though)  Pool tables  Foosball  dart boards  Megatouch  theres always something to do so you are never bored ,?
1520835,Great new addition to the strip  Everything is homemade  Ive been here a few times and the last time  i had a homemade Italian sausage sandwich that was served on a nice fresh roll  They have an awesome selection of craft beers and they have wine on tap  very cool!  Cant wait for warmer weather to get the garage doors opened up!,?
1523060,Great option for Chinese hot pot; heres the lowdown ~THE GOOD seafood quality vegetable quality portions vegan/vegetarian selections open sauce bar (loved this!) THE DECENT~ broth~ forgetful  but apologetic service ~ pretty pricyTHE BAD  conveyor belt stuff  the items you order off the menu seem more fresh Overall  a great (but pricy) soup option in Chinatown  Be wary of over ordering  and bring an appetite!TIP: ponzu  green onions  and garlic is always a safe base if youre a newbie at the sauce bar,?
1523110,Great option for healthy vegan and gluten free options that are sustainably sourced and ecofriendly  I had the Salad bowl which was delicious and incredibly filling  For the amount of food they provide its an incredibly reasonable price  for an expensive heavily trafficked area ,?
1523407,Great outdoor bar where one can easily converse with strangers   My stranger and I shared food even though my wife and her friend were there beside me   I had Panni   Wife pasta bolanese  Friend vegetable pasta special   All were delicious   ,?

1524589,Great patio with fountain view! And it changes colors (the fountain)!!!!!Nice decor with an authentic pizzeria vibe  My pepperoni pizza was pretty awesome  and they do not skimp on toppings! The crust was a little black  and I know they are wood fired  but it didnt taste burnt  Love the cheese too  Disclosure my pizza was free  as it was a birthday large pizza through the email club! Thank you Grimaldis for this great deal  One issue though they sent an email advertising wine specials for February  and the bartender told me they sold out already on Feb  17!I had the house red for $4  which is a good price  and an OK wine ,?
1525327,Great people  great food  best ground beef kabob Ive ever eaten! Ive eaten kabobs all over the country  all over the world  including in Syria  Kuwait  and Iraq  Having said that  their ground beef and chicken kabobs are much better than even the countries where the best kabobs are rumored to be had! My God  have you ever tasted something so good and you have to just pause? Lets not even mention how wonderful their customer service is! Out of this world  they will make feel as if you are a guest in their home and they are gracious hosts  Oh ya  prices are reasonable  and the ingredients so fresh that I choose to eat here weekly!,?
1525770,Great pho with probably the best broth Ive had in Pho They make an excellent Vietnamese iced coffee  with beans that they roast at the restaurant  You can also buy the beans at the restaurant The service is also great  The owners are friendly and were happy to help make our experience a good one,?

I had the corn beef hash and eggs and my wife had the two egg breakfast ! Want to go back and have the Chicken and Waffles! Looks like a ton of food and most popular item being ordered! Corn Beef Hash was cooked perfectly without being greasy! Poached eggs were slightly overdone but still yummy ! Great place for family and looking forward to going back !,?
1529201,Great place  I typically do the $12 haircuts at Great Clips but was looking for a little more of a professional experience and a new style  I told Austin what I do and what i was looking for and he got to work  20 Minutes and a beer later it came out great  definitely happy and Ill be back ,?
1529927,Great place and honest cooking right in front of you ,?
1529967,Great place and my kids love it   i havent splurged enough to do the train ride  but the walking is starting to get too much   Some of the exhibits are not viewer friendly but all in all it is a good place to view the animals   the zoo lights are not that spectacular  i have been twice now with our pass but have decided not to repeat this year   still a good investment if you have kids   dont go in the summer ,?
1529992,Great place and people! My sister recommend me to come here! It definitely was worth it! Dane did an amazing job,?
1530300,Great place but tokens are now SIX for $10 00   (  One token gets you 1015 pitches  It sound like a lot but it goes quickly  the staff said   They were right ,?
1530386,Great place easy to find just off strip as well  I found this place through Facebook recommendations on a Jeep group  They offer it all here from mild to wild depending on your budget  Very friendly guys easy to talk with and discuss your needs  Very knowledgeable as well and have options for your build  I was able to talk with Dennis and arrange for a lift install the same week and discuss other steps going forward what would be best for my needs  Will be back nightly recommend,?
1530584,Great place for Chinese food  The customer service is top notch! I stopped by after work to pick up my dinner to go  As i sat to wait i ordered a tai tea  my tea arrived in less than a minute  As i looked at my menu  the owner (i wish i had asked for her name) sat next to me to answer all of my questions  She was great  friendly and made me feel so at ease  I will definitely will be coming back  My food was delicious and the price is not bad  Next time i will get names and will take pictures ,?

1532301,Great place for a very leisurely dinner  Seriously  its gonna take 3 hours so I hope you like who youre with!! NOT GOOD FOR FIRST DATES  When Im there I usually get the dinner for 2 with whoever im with  cheese fondue  salad & meat courses  Then were STUFFED with no room for dessert  Here are a few alternatives Ive found:1  Go in and order individual dinners  not the dinner for 2 thing  This way you each get a meat course (I think it comes w/ salad too)  and then you will have room for dessert  2  Go in JUST for dessert  (This is my favorite thing to do with my sister  its great girl time!) Have a very light dinner at home or wherever and then you can sit and eat chocolate fondue yumminess and drink good coffee  (They have great coffee)  I also highly recommend the espresso martini ,?
1532850,Great place for breakfast and coffee  The breakfast burrito is good and the mocha coffee ,?
1534358,Great place for fresh oysters (good selection of fresh oysters from B C and PE I) service is great and the atmosphere is warm and casual  Moderate selection of beers but they do have a great wine and champagne list  Location at King and Spadina is fantastic  Love the selection of sauces they have too (from mild to smokey  to super hot and spicy)  Thing they could improve on   Hire another shucker  it can take a while to get your oysters when they are busy  add some more craft beers  and change up the bread (maybe bring in some flat  or cornbreads) Overall though a solid 4 star oyster bar!,?
1535701,Great place for party supplies n costumes they also have a post office,?

1537655,Great place in the neighborhood to stop by thats noisy so if the kids are acting up no one cares because no one can hear them!  Great kids menutypical kids grubpizzas are good  Nice selection on the menu of just about everything from burgers  pasta  soups  salads and Asian fare and wonderful wines to forget about the day  When youre craving a carb fest   the Fetuccini Alfredo I found was the best thing on the menu   Hubby likes the variety of brews and the sports channels ,?
1537901,Great place on South Blvd   Lunch special is $5 95!  The juice is great  I had passion fruit   I got a pork dish  yellow rice  and yellow plantains and it was a great combination   Other items I enjoyed were the steamed bread appetizers  chicken empanadas  and the green plantains dipped in some kind of vinegary garlic concoction   Cant beat the value!,?
1537959,Great place outside the strip! Open 24 hours a day  Awesome pho  Their chicken wings with the Kim Long sauce is really good too  Theres always a crowd waiting but the wait is never more than a few minutes  Highly recommend this spot!,?

1541038,Great place to get a flavorful meal under $10  I got the tonkatsu ramen and a bottled water  Ramen was good  but Ill have to remember to get extra pork next time  Service was great  Food came out right away  It was another lunch for 1  and it wasnt so bad  I was in and out of there within 30 or so minutes (around 4pm on a Monday) ,?
1541540,Great place to get in shape  No need for a gym membership  Making it a fun experience to learn self defense  The owner Steven Comas is really cool instructor  teaching the fundamentals of krav maga in the simplest way possible  He will help improve your techniques until you get it right  Once again fun  friendly  energetic environment to learn to build and to get your body fit!,?
1541611,Great place to get pizza in the Venetian   Its located just around the corner from the main lobby   Pizza slices are New York style  thin crust  but huge slice   Single topping is about $5 per slice At first  it seems like a let down because you think you are going to get a slice of pizza that has been sitting under the heat lamp all day   But once you order  they pull a piece out and heat it up in the pizza oven for a few minutes Good service and good quality  I would eat there again ,?
1542060,Great place to get your tea  Very friendly people  Definitely I will continue to shop here  Keep up the good work!,?

1542290,Great place to go for a cheat day I went here with my husband last Sunday afternoon out of curiosity and it was a pretty good decision  Walking it  it was a little overwhelming trying to decide what to get but the lady on staff walked us through the menu  I opted the Twix cinnamon roll and my husband got a custom roll with Oreos on it  The staff is very friendly and the cinnamon rolls are so delicious ,?
1542407,Great place to go for breakfast  Ive eaten here 5 or 6 times since June 2014  the food is always delicious  I have tried French Toast with chocolate chips and banana  very fresh and delish; breakfast burrito  pancakes  Swiss and mushroom omelette and always with coffee and milk  The breakfast has always been good  The service here is 50/50  Ive gotten waited on by people who dont pay attention to my table and by a couple who have done a wonderful job waiting on me  So  in conclusion  if you want a diner atmosphere with diner food  this is it! The service should be better since it is inside Aliante Hotel and casino       I will eat here again though  And the prices arent terrible  they are reasonable ,?
1542916,Great place to go to if your looking for some great deals  It is kind of a flea market in a mall setting  Great to go to if your looking for unique things for your home or a great outfit  Also  some great cell phone stores to fix  get a new phone or get a cell phone case  The best part of this mall was trying the different foods  This place should be considered one of Ontarios tourist sites Overall great experience :),?
1543772,Great place to grab some dessert! The ice cream is outstanding  The wife enjoyed her hot chocolate and she ranked in top 5  which for her is alot since she is very picky  We have shared two desserts  one was the ice cream which was very tasty  and the second was the crepes cake  which I found bland  It needed something extra to make it stand out  however it was very fluffy and the side of strawberry jelly made it eatable ,?
1543996,Great place to hang out in Little Italy  nice drinks  excellent food  I do however recommend the calamari  the frog legs  and Maxis signature escarole (delicious)  And  the Maxis pizza is to die for  The owners are both here at all times (both fantastic cooks)  so you know you will get the service and attention that you deserve! Side notes: outdoor sitting is available  and during the Feast of Assumption in August  they host a fantastic party in the back!,?
1544096,Great place to hang out with friends  Awesome staff  We always have a great time when we come  I would definately recommend this place over any other!,?
1544648,Great place to have dinner    Good food  good for a nice date and smaller groups (8 or less   ),?
1544859,Great place to hike! Im out of practice but made it to the top  which was so worth it!  Definitely very crowded  but filled with like minded  kind people  There are no bathrooms  Even so  bring plenty of water  This is a steep  rocky hike  which took more out of me than expected  I had extra water in the car  but next time will carry more with me ,?
1545022,Great place to let kids burn some energy for a few hours  I like that there are plenty of bouncer/interactive options for all ages  They just added gated toddler zones in each room as well  Weve attended a few birthday parties here as well and they seem very well run and the kids always have a blast ,?
1545295,Great place to mingle   kind of an oasis in the midwest    walk in anytime during the winter months  and your glasses will immediately fog up like you stepped into the tropics!  I havent had too much of the food here  but the appetizers are great (coconut shrimp is awesome) and they have THE BEST chips and gaucomole that I have had in recent years   If youre a dark rum fan  try a Zaya rum on the rocks  you wont regret it!,?
1545859,Great place to see old vintage toys you grew up with  The only negative thing I have to say about the store is that it is WAY OVERPRICED  Other than that  its big fun,?
1546113,Great place to sit back and relax have a drink befor dinner  The wait staff were friendly and service was great ,?
1546557,Great place to stay  Clean  efficient  and well maintained  Staff was not always very courteous or professional  but the two mornings I requested early access to the fitness center they accommodated my request  A couple of recommendations for the hotel management: 1) Open the fitness center before 6 am  Most people will have meetings or other obligations they need to attend to and if they cant get into the fitness center earlier they will be unable to use it  2) Some additional training is needed for the staff  Most people who are traveling and away from home appreciate being made to feel welcome and treated with curtesy  I found this to be lacking in every experience with the front desk staff  They were rushed and dismissive each time (all different staff members)  3) Provide at least a couple of bottles of water for guests in the rooms  Madison water tastes horrible  Its an inexpensive thing you can do to ensure guests feel welcome and have water to drink ,?
1547095,Great place to take out of town visitors   They freak when you say your taking them to a gas station and then are pleasingly surprised  by the high quality food and atmosphere ,?
1548668,Great place with great donuts  The donuts are made after you order and always warm! Kinda crowded during peak times tho  So may be good to go after morning rush and during week  But i will say that they get you in and out pretty quickly  The staff is very friendly ,?
1548751,Great place with great service  My wife and many friends regularly get their nails done here  I dont get my nails done but I have done business them several times  purchasing gifts for others  They have great service and patiently explained their services to me when they saw I knew nothing about nails! Very clean  and nice people  It is right next to Hawaiian Experience Spa so you can get a massage or facial and go next door to get your nails done  Very convenient!,?
1549049,Great place!  A local somewhat hard to find pub behind Petes fish in chips  Cool birds  We had the topless salad and perch burger  Both were very good  the salad was exceptional  Great beers and drink specials ,?
1549335,Great place!  The atmosphere is great and the service is friendly and attentive   The food is fresh and unique with a healthy flair   The almond margarita is to die for and you must get a dessert   Toffee Cake is a great one   We loved the toffee cake so much they gave us the recipe ,?
1549512,Great place! Amazing view!  Pear Champagne was divine and the breakfast brunch was so tasty! Really nice event at the Malaparte  will definitely go again!,?

1551018,Great place! The roti canai with curry is delicious  Id recommend the Ayam Goring Kampung  the Angel Fire Chicken (if you can handle the spice) and Pineapple Fried Rice  Also the Teh Tarik (tea) was delicious  Service is average  depends on the server you get ,?

1552621,Great place  great atmosphere  Prices are a little on the high side but the food is really nice quality  Fish tacos  nachos  soups  sweet potato fries are some of my faves  They update their special foods pretty frequently and regularly have trivia nights and live bands  Very family friendly place  my boyfriend and I come her regularly and will continue to do so!,?
1552658,Great place  great environment  perfect location  great owners  great staff  good food!,?
1552729,Great place  great food  great price and super friendly staff  We headed here after visiting the Spring Preserve   A perfect finish I must say  And our little baby girl loved their chicken   which is why I have to give this place 5 stars  Sophie is very picky with food  She never eats any chicken  We tested it the very next day  I tried to feed her some chicken from Souplantation  Boy was I wrong  She spit it out right away  Awesome BFG! We will definely be back  Even if the drive is a bit further away for us Heee   I see you got that Bibimbap special  Heheee  I will put it on my wish list for the next visit   LOL,?

1561842,Great restaurant! When first hearing sushi buffet  I initially thought everything was going to be premade  but I was mistaken  We were warmly welcomed and seated right away by whom I presume to be the owner  The menu is laid out very nicely into different categories  and had nice visuals of the food  Everything was clean and well kept  Our server frequently checked in on us  and our food came much more quickly than expected  You could see all of the sushi chefs making the fresh sushi  Weird side note: the bathrooms were SO COOL! The walls were rock and the sink was jade and went up the wall then divided into two  The food was amazing! My boyfriend and I definitely ate more than $23 worth of sushi each!

1566970,Great selection of used books to look through  friendly people  They are very homely  the perfect nook and cranny sort of place for a used bookstore connossiuer  Thin  long and cozy  The one department they seem to lack slightly in is being up to date on new releases  but who goes to used bookstores for such a thing?For collectors  avid readers  or anyone looking for a classic used book store atmosphere  Pauls is in a fabulously convenient location and will provide winningly ,?
1568618,Great service always consistent  food is always on point  Not 5 stars because they dont do take out over the phone which is unfortunate because if that was available Id be eating there once a week ,?

Be sure and ask for smaller portions if you want to sample the menu   If you dont ask you get a full portion and its huge!

1573258,Great service but a small venue  Outside tables makes for perfect accessibility,?
1573267,Great service but fell short on the scoop  I ordered their cookies gelato on a cone  The struggle was real getting that scoop on my cone  And thats where my cone fell short of gelato  I was done eating it by the time I payed for it  I really liked the flavors  It wasnt too sweet  and balanced with cookie and chocolate crumbs  Next time I will fight for that scoop  It probably would have been better in the cup ,?

1576093,Great service! Amazing interesting menu I was traveling to Montreal with a group of 10 people so had a hard time finding good restaurants that could accommodate everyone  Luckily  when I called Lawrence Saturday morning for a brunch seating that day  they were super nice and said they could hold a table of 10 with one highchair for us if we got there in 45 minutes  Well  we arrived almost an hour and a half later to a line up of about 10 people ahead of us and they STILL saved our table! The staff were amazing and didnt once give us any attitude for being so late  or so loud or so messy  The food was delicious  fresh and inventive as far as brunch goes  Their beignets were so good someone at our table almost licked the table when the chocolate sauce oozed out of it  Our server took pity on him and brought him a small dish of chocolate sauce  so nice ,?

1579748,Great service  food is just ok and they dont know how to make a margarita with agave nectar and just lime juice   Apparently they can only use the house mix that contains simple syrup and lemon and lime juice  no substituion available even though there are bowls of limes everywhere  :)  Their beef barbacoa tacos had tons of red onion and hardly any meat ,?

Friendly staff is always a plus as well ,?

1586583,Great show  this ladys range is unbelievable  I would put her right up there with a Vegas star from the past doing vocal impersonations  Danny Gans  You wont be disappointed with this show ,?
1586748,Great show that brought back nostalgic moments   The addition of a live Ed Sullivan added humor to the show   The production could have been more cohesive and more creative  the sound was garbled at times  and no  there was no real wow factor   Costuming was great  John Lennon had some brilliant performances  and Ringo looked better than Ringo without those thick straight bangs   All in all  this was the best Beatles tribute Ive watched!,?
1587020,Great show! We even got upgraded by staff to a closer table! We were there with my in laws so we took up the 4 seater table so it felt private  He was really entertaining! I would recommend this show to my friends ,?

1588256,Great soups and daily specials   I havent had the negative experiences other people have had I have only had the falafel sandwiches  and you do need to mix everything together  otherwise you are getting uniform mouthfuls of various things  not everything mixed together  and the tempeh sandwiches   Both of them were great   I LOVE their cookies  and really enjoyed the various soups and daily specials I like the one on MacKay more because its a nicer venue  and they dont take forever to make their food   Some of their salads arent great  though  just meh   Good portion size too and friendly staff ,?
1589093,Great spot and such yummy soups!!! Perfect meal or snack after a hard afternoon of shopping at the outlet malls and you cant beat the prices,?
1589309,Great spot for a diner type breakfast   The biscuits and gravy is a plateful and tasted great    Gravy is homemade and you can tell     Full portion is more than enough so come hungry     Country omelette was also delicious with gravy topping!    Friendly and quick service    Great value   Would recommend ,?
1589352,Great spot for a large groups!! We called ahead while traveling to Rochester NY  The young lady informed me on the phone that she would tell her manager so they can be prepared for the group arrival  Once we arrived I was greeted by several friendly staff members and informed our tables were already prepared for the 35 guest  All I can say top notch service/food start to finish  Thank you for assisting our group in meeting our breakfast needs! Written on behalf of Complete Transportation Inc ,?
1589806,Great spot for causal mexican food that is good quality  I especially love that they handmake all of their tortillas (you can watch through a window while you stand in line to order) and they have a HUGE selection of hot sauce in a little shelf unit by the knives  forks  and napkins  The only thing I am not crazy about is that the burritos only have cheese  rice  meat and beans wrapped inside  and everything else (lettuce  guac  sour cream  pico de gallo) is on the side  which forces you to eat the burrito with a knife and fork instead of holding it wrapped up in your hands  They do offer enchiladastyle burritos which is pretty awesome  Solid mexican food restaurant that I will definitely return to ,?
1589877,Great spot for dinner with some ladies from work  Very quaint house setting with lots of character  Food was creative and delicious  very impressive  This would be a special night out with the hubby in the future for me  as it is a little pricey  but would stop by the outdoor bar anytime for a drink and snack ,?
1590012,Great spot for informal dining This is basically a campus bar on steroids   The atmosphere is very casual with open seating outside and inside they create a list There were about 15 beers on draft  another 25 or so in bottle/can The food menu is extensive featuring (as respected by the name) a lot of seafood options   The oysters on halfshell are excellent (be advise that the cocktail sauce does not need the additional horseradish the provide unless you have not tastebuds at all)   The fish and chips is very good   We have also tried the tuna stuffed tomato  burger  etc      Parking can be a little difficult  but it is worth the try ,?
1590249,Great spot for some casual street style tacos! The food here have some Filipino influence from the owners  so youll find stuff like sisig tacos and sisig stacks (thick cut fries) on the menu  which is great and really differentiates them from other places They also serve steamed baos here  and the one with fried chicken is a musttry! The chicken is crispy  tender and juicy on the inside  Yum!During my visit some items were not available  such as the Lengua (tongue) tacos that I really wanted to try  Probably just because they are brand new and still working out their inventory  Would have to go back to try them at some point Definitely worth a stop!,?
1590618,Great spot near Laurier   Good chicken  better fries; cheeses and fried cod are excellent as well   Wine by the glass is a good deal   Try the Vin de France ,?
1590744,Great spot to bring your dog and hang on the patio!! Good food lots of food and drink selections! Good specials!,?
1591792,Great spot  cool environment  friendly staff  great coffee! I spent many days writing at Biddles over the summer  look forward to spending much of my winter break there as well  Truly  the only negative comment that I can make (which isnt even a complaint) is that refills are full price  And if thats the worst thing that I can come up with  Biddles must be doing it right ,?
1592304,Great spray tans and the owner of this franchise listens to feedback! After some interesting issues with customer service he got an awesome gal named Patience in here   This was only her third day and all the beds went down due to maybe the 116 degree heat or some other issue but she held her cool and managed to get a few working again   She maintained a great attitude under pressure and did the best she could! Bravo Patience and thank you for great customer service!,?
1592527,Great staff and clean establishment  Maryanne was amazingly kind and quick  Its a great spot to pick up a quick sandwich  Fell in love with Capn when I was a senior in high school and volunteered at a place that ordered Capriottis for catering  The Bobbie is Amaaaaazing ,?

1594790,Great steakhouse   I was picked up at the airport by two old friends  Then we went for steak in memory of our fallen comrades George & Howard as rememberance day approaches  We arrived early for happy hour following a well dressed couple  After viewing the Harry Potter like architecture  we settled on a semi private room overlooking the bar and Juliette room  Fantastic views   Plenty of beers on tap both domestic and imported   Garlic bread and huge pickles enthused our appetites   With the Breeders Cup in the background and the forefront of our minds we chatted with our lovely server who took care of our needs and wants  New York steak  filet mignon and pepper steak with extra sauce were great   Our horse didnt win the race we certainly did with our dinner experience ,?
1595009,Great stop for an iced tea or iced coffee! Nice  clean  modern break from the chaos of bohemian Kensington Ave  I went here each time I visited Kensington Market on my three week visit to Toronto  Enjoyed the service  air con  decor  free WiFi and refreshing drinks ,?

1597313,Great sushi for a great price! Was down here for a business trip and Ive never seen such low prices for entrees and sushi that turned out to be rather good  I had a $20 dinner that probably wouldve cost $3035 elsewhere  Good selection of special rolls ,?
1597342,Great sushi for the lunch deal! The service is quick and everything tastes great  We even had left overs that we couldnt finish and they didnt charge us more for it!,?
1597544,Great sushi quality and I highly respect the chefs professionalism!

Chicken was seasoned perfectly with delicious basmati rice and yummy fried yuca  I loved the fact that the owner himself checked on us a couple times  making sure everything was good and we had what we needed  It shows he cares about his customers and in return his business gets supported    Our waitress was on top of things too  We will definitely be back,?

1601017,Great time with my family   Our favorite rides were the Intimidator and the Fury  both first in class for thrill rides   The park was clean and the staff helpful   The water rides were a bit crowded  so you might plan to go to them earlier in the day before the crowds come   Food options were good not great  but pricing was fair for amusement parks   Id recommend a visit with the family ,?
1601399,Great to have a 24 hour gym just a 5 min drive from my area  Just nestled in a random plaza with a grocery store and a bunch of other services  Id have to say this location is on my top 3 list  Its nice and spacious and never too busy during rush hour  I also like the size of their group FX room compared to other locations where you are not crammed  I also wont go to the gym if the change rooms are gross as they are highly unsanitary  This location change rooms are kept clean and is never too busy so you never need to look or wait for a locker There is lots of equipment to use and all are very well maintained  This gym provides Group Exercise classes and spinning classes  There is also a womens section which is a lot bigger than other locations that Ive been to Lastly  I am giving this 5th star to the service  The staff are always friendly and helpful  Consistent service!

You can see Paris to MGM from here  Nice ambient for a casual date  upbeat fun and romantic vibe  Long walk from parking garage but you have an option to valet at the mall side  They have the best poke bowl Ive ever had in my mouth  The seasoning on the rice is out of this world!!Chilean Seabass is amazing! Balanced 3 flavors  salty with a lil of sweet and sour plus the crunchy texture from crispy onion ,?
1605364,Great views but the customer service sucks  Plus the drinks are over priced for the Stratosphere  Might come here again to the Top of the World restaurant but thats it ,?
1605387,Great views of Vegas but terrible service!!! Rose had to be the worst waitress I have ever had in a restaurant so she took away from everything else  Ignored us the whole time that we were there and was not apologetic about it either nor did she try and make it right  For the service you get the prices are not worth it ,?
1605876,Great way to have a family night!! So much fun! Was my first escape room  Cannot wait to come back with our family and try another one!!,?
1605973,Great way to start the day! Food was good  The decor is relaxing  pretty and green  Its a great corner location  right next to a church  You order at the counter then pick up your drink  Your sandwich/breakfast will be delivered to your table  Great location to relax or meet friends  I had the avocado Croissant sandwich with procuitto and egg  DELICIOUS  I would definitely get again  Must be able to walk up stairs to enter the restaurant and then to seating ,?
1606201,Great wine and service from Jason at Rott n Grapes! It was my first time in and I was overwhelmed with the hospitality and service I received here  I cant wait to recommend this place to family and friends in the area  This place is one of a kind and a true gem in the Central Phoenix area  Cheers!,?
1606544,Great wings at a fair price   We were in the neighborhood and needed some lunch   Now we will be making the 15 mile drive just for these wings    Their ATL dry rub is amazing and the spicy version is great ,?
1606845,Great wokd meals as well as great sushi! Drink specials and happy hour sushi! Try the drunken shrimp and chicken! The seafood curry is incredible too!,?
1607564,Great!  Loved it   Expensive  but a wonderful experience   Ambiance and decor was innovative   I did the 3 course meal   Uni and oyster on the shell was something I enjoyed and havent ever had ,?
1608625,Great  friendly place to sit and enjoy your brew  Also good breakfast sandwiches  Love finding independently owned stores ,?
1609104,Great  juicy  burger  I got the bacon burger with everything  it even comes with mushrooms! It was cooked to perfection  without pink in the middle (Im picky about the pink in burgerssensitive stomach) but it was still juicy and tender on the inside  The employees had smiles on their faces and were very friendly  The man with an Irish accent  whos name Im upset I dont remember  was over the top helpful to all the customers in the joint  It was nice to receive such happy service coming from a fast food place  Then after they bagged my order they put a whole nother scoop of fries in the bag on top of everything! Seriously  who doesnt love bag fries?,?
1609282,Great  quick burgers! Ask for a side of spread for your fries  Go heathy or healthier by ordering your burger protein style so its without the bun and wrapped in lettuce ,?
1609469,Great  trendy place for a sit down Mexican meal  Cheap margaritas too! Service was very friendly and efficient  They want to make sure you are happy! I would absolutely go back!,?
1609496,Great  unique food  Super friendly staff  Music was not to my taste  but hey  I think it was at least native to Malaysia ,?
1610218,Greatly impressed by how improved this restaurant is! We went a few years ago before the new management or owner and the food was never more than ok  Gave it a try again since the location is so good and really enjoyed it  Service was nice and the food was good  a bit above what Id normally expect for bar food  We went when it was around 88 degrees and it was cool under the shade and they had fans running  Would definitely recommend this place!,?
1610914,Green curry with shrimp here is amazing! Very unique recipe  I order it way too often  Haha I love Nickys Thai Kitchen as well but this is a completely different approach to the dish  The lemon grass soup is also very good  All my orders are always consistent and as anticipated  And the food is always ready unbelievably fast  I dont know how they do it!,?
1611675,Greg & Leonard  you guys make my stay enjoyable  safe and accommodating here at the Palladium  For any issues that arise  you both are so helpful  understanding & speedy  Seriously  thank you for all you do!,?
1612297,Greyhound is a nightmare!  This is the first time Ive ever had to deal with them   I have always traveled via airline or amtrak so perhaps I was naive going into it   They charged $21 because I was buying the ticket for someone else   They also claimed to have all of these wonderful discounts and deals but when it came down to it they were very specific   If I had the opiton to use another mode of transportation I would have   Avoid the Dirty Dog if you can!,?
1612448,Grilled calamari was excellent  I took 4 choice of meat  with fries  The house sauce was great too! I would definitely go back ,?
1612553,Grilled lamb chops were perfect as was the risotto and mixed grilled fish  The antipasti bar has a nice selection of appetitizers   White table clothes with good ambience and service  I will be back ,?
1612781,Grimaldis  Grimaldis     I just cant quit you Pizza is hardly what one thinks of when out to Vegas what with the plethora of buffets  and starstudded chef restos  But Grimaldis is the little pizzeria that could  Why dont you come out West young Man  I know you would be a starh Baby!Serious  Grimaldis got chops and since they are now in the Palazzo its a lot easier to get a pie fix  I opted for the calzone this time and of course I wasnt disappointed the only gripe (and its minor) is that the cost of the extras on a calzone IMHO is a tad overpriced  But the bread crust is amazing  the sauce is molte bella  and Grimaldis would certainly make a top 5 on anyones pizzeria list ,?
1613211,Gross food  Really too bad because its right next to our otherwise somewhat remote office  Service is slow and often unfriendly  Bar is fine for drinks  I hope it improves or goes out of business because the building has a cool vibe and the location is great ,?
1613338,Gross! I am so angry with this place! I went tonight for the first time and chose the burrito spinach wrap! A very small portion for 10 00 plus tax! After the first bite I almost threw up! It was so disgusting! The rice was gummy/hard and I know for a fact it mustve been sitting in that fridge for days! The burrito had a weird fish taste!! It was literally a ripoff! Will never go again!,?
1613914,Ground Control is a common study location for me and my friends  Having a unique atmosphere  comfortable seats  coffee and gelato  As well as a full service lunch and dinner menu and a full selection of craft beers and a variety of wines perfect for after a long afternoon of studying to finish the day off right  My favorite are their pizzas handmade in their brick oven  The best Chai Latte Ive ever had! Open mic night is Wednesday nights and some bright talent from around these parts of town  Overall 4/5 for the atmosphere and wide variety of eats and treats ,?
1614492,Growing up in Lakewood  I started hanging out drinking Phoenix coffee in high school  I was especially spoiled by the amazing toddy and iced mochas  When the Lakewood Phoenix owner opened her own independent cafe  she eventually changed roasters  and despite my best efforts I havent been able to stop missing the Phoenix toddy  Im ashamed to say I didnt know there was an Ohio City location! I only knew of downtown  and Coventry  I often drive way out of my way just to swing by those locations when I just need my Phoenix fix  When I stumbled upon the Yelp listing  I was super excited! No more driving to Coventry just for coffee  Best part is that they have a patio! They also have free wifi  so its a great place to get things done  The baristas were super fun and friendly (genuinely  not the type that try to hard)  I wish they stayed open a little later since Im a night owl  but hey  not everything can revolve around me :) ,?
1614516,Growing up in NH and spending my summers in Maine  Im pretty particular about my seafood  I must say  CML hit the nail on the head I went with my aunt on the grand opening in Pittsburgh  We waited 2 hours in line  but it was a nice day and the owner  Sabin  hung out and chatted with me for about 40 minutes and definitely helped pass the time  I got the Maine lobster roll  lobster tots and clam chowder (thanks Sabin!) and all were so good! So good that I went back a few days later to another location to get more lobster This time  in addition to the Maine roll and chowder  I got a lobster grilled cheese  One word: YUM!!It is expensive  but thats the cost for delicious and fresh seafood  It reminds me of home so Ill continue to go and support this business and the owners really care about their customers and food ,?
1615227,Guacamole  blood orange spritzer  taquitos  tamales  chicken Caesar all delicious  Amber  our server  was a delight  4 stars for food vs price  1 star for the amazing service and view!!! Love it!,?
1615287,Guardian was great during the move in process and the staff was very helpful However  and this is a big one  they will completely lie to you when it comes to moving out to keep your money   When I started the lease they said that 30 days notice was all I needed to do to cancel   40 days prior to my last day I sent them in a fax which I then called to confirm had arrived and was told that because I pre pay each month  and was going to end mid month  to just come in on my last day and they would refund any unused portion of the monthly rent When I called to get the half month refund I was told that they do not offer any refunds so if you use even 1 minute of time in a month you have to pay for the whole thing I would not recommend this to anyone  avoid them at all costs and if you have to use them  do not setup auto bill pay so you can give them the correct amount when leaving ,?
1615307,Guava margarita    Holy moly   Straight  Out of a coconut   Brussels sprout nachos!!!!!  Coconut icecream is perfection ,?
1615882,Guns Etc have a pretty good selection and above average customer service  they just dont have the greatest retail prices  I enjoy coming here to shop around but most times make a final purchase elsewhere  I do use Guns Etc for all of my gunsmithing needs however  superior work and more than fair pricing ,?
1616269,Guy at register ignored me until I asked if they were open  He then failed to say thank you when I paid  just silently handed me the receipt  With dozens of other food options within 50 feet  it seems this place would make an effort to welcome customers  Vegetable biryani was decent  and very spicy  but I knocked off a star because I cannot stand rudeness like that!,?
1616840,Guys  based on what I was expecting this place is totally fun and great  Its hard to find large ball bowling these days and I love the old school vintage vibes of a small town bowling alley  and we were there with a whole hilarious family gang so I was biased towards fun  Yes  it does look closed from outside when you arrive  yes the stairs are a bit creepy on the way up  and the bar lounge and casse croute inside were closed  the candy machines almost empty  and the ladies bathroom was creepy to put it mildly  But the staff here were super warm and kind and nice! Kathy immediately recognized my friend from years back when he used to bowl there with work pals regularly  We had a couple beers and enjoyed the wide disparity in our skills and had a great time  There were several other groups of young people there having fun and the vibe was perfect for a snowy evening in the burbs  I liked it and I wish them everything good!,?
1617383,Gyros are awesome!  Owner is Greek American!!!  Not a fan of the waitress Nancy though she is straight out of Ed Debevics  Insulted me for ordering a reubin and a pancake on the side   Ask to NOT sit in her section   Seriously  shes THAT bad   A good indication of this is  when you ask her her name  she never gives you an honest answer   She literally lies to your face so you wont complain to management about her   Im surprised shes still there!Good wait staff and highly recommended is Greg   Hes very attentive  kind and quick on his feet!  Just look for the big burly muscular Dude thats Greg ,?
1617552,H&M is my favorite store ever!! I like this location but it does get crowded at times  They have a large variety of clothes and a range of prices that are generally affordable for the young professional whos fashion conscious  They really have something for everyone  including the men in your life  the kids  the working professionals  the trendy catch phrase seeker  and the athlete  Its a great shoppe and is always clean & the staff are friendly and always helpful ,?
1618737,HIGHLY RECOMMEND going to {B Studio Waxology}! Miss Tran is AWESOME! She is so open and gentle! For those who are shy and its your first time getting a Brazilian or Ballpark  B Waxology is the way to go! She will make you comfortable & relaxed! I definitely go to B Waxology for Thuy who is so down to earth and very informative  but also for her cleanliness and atmosphere thats set up in her studio!,?
1618921,HIGHLY recommended!!!!!!Best breakfast i have ever had!!They start with a free fresh fruit skewer for everyone    yummyDecorations in the restaurant was very unique & beautiful Food was AWESOME      side of potatoes were the best ive ever had Everything was delicious! Freshly ground Lavazza coffee for $1 48 (Canadian) unlimited refills!!!!get there early  lines were out the door after we arrived around 9:30AM on a Tuesday Service was also spectacular ,?
1619351,HOLY MOLY WITH A BIG BOWL OF RAVIOLI AND A FATTY CANNOLI! This place is the bombdiggity com! Best place to eat when you cant decide where to eat  and also if you need to fill up quick and cheap!Service is surprisingly quick  what with how many people line up here  and the sandwiches are to droooooooool for! I had 2 sandwiches a day for the 4 days that I was in Vegas because I just could not get enough  The bread is the centerpiece of this wonderful shabang of awesomeness  and its just perfectly crunchy and soft on the inside I had the Holiday Turkey (OMGAGA) sandwich over the holiday season  and it was like the Venus di Milo of sandwiches! It was turkey  stuffing  cranberry sauce  and like special mayo all wrapped up in that delicious bread The Full Montague  the Ham and Swiss breakfast sandwich  and the Cannonball sub  are all close seconds Definitely come here for breakfast  lunch  dinner  and afterdinner!,?
1619826,HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE! Very rude purple in there! They forgot to put something in my bag then have me an attitude when I went inside and asked for it  The last practically threw the bag at me  Never again ,?
1619828,HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE! Worked with many people in the office   Could not get them to answer my questions always had to call me back and never did  I had to call them multiple times for an answers  In the end they did not help me out  If you are looking for a professional car dealer this is NOT the place ,?
1619932,HORRIBLE DRIVE THRU EXPERIENCE!!!! I was third in line and BOTH cars in front of me had orders that were screwed up  Thought maybe theyd get one order right   but I was wrong  I get to the window and the girl hands me a drink (which was not part of my order)  Told her that I had not ordered a drink  She says well WHAT did you order?  She took the order to start with and had everybodys orders wrong  MAnager came over  told me I owed them more money  This was Tuesday Dec 6 at around 4:00 pm  Need to get regional Mgr out there and clean house!!!,?
1619933,HORRIBLE DRIVE THRU  Waited about 8 minutes at the speaker box only to be told to pull up to the window and wait another 3 minutes just for someone to tell me the drive thru is closed  No apology  no sign    No nothing  Awful display of customer service ,?
1621217,HORRIBLE! Skip this spot! The shaved ice is overpriced and then they have the WORST customer service! It has the slowest service and then the owner and workers have an attitude about being slow instead of realizing maybe they should hire more staff if they cant handle more than one order in a reasonable amount of time  There are sooooo many other businesses with amazing treats that also have amazing customer service and adequate staff; go there and skip overpaying for some syrup and ice  We will never ever come back to this place  Lesson learned the hard way ,?
1622288,HUGE cheese selection  We didnt have steak the day we wentjust for midafternoon snack  It wasnt crowded at all  Terrace is pretty (get a table with an umbrella!)  Wish they didnt allow smoking out there ,?
1623970,Had I walked into a $5 00 a plate breakfast house the only good thing I would have to say is They give you a lot of food  For a place named Hash House you would expect hash to be served  not hash ingredients without the necessary chopping and prepping  My husband was so disappointed I ordered Eggs  Potatoes  & Pancakes for $16 00  The excuse for the price is that the pancakes are huge  They are  They have good flavor but are rubbery and far too large  The potatoes are large cubes cooked crispy on all sides  covered in seasoned salt  and tossed with raw green onions  I guess the idea is to make the food artsy but it just feels and tastes like the cooks are lazy ,?
1624550,Had The Blue Cheese Burger with egg and very good  Wie had the hot dog with coleslaw on it  She almost did not get the dog because of the slaw  but after tasting it she said was the best hot dog she ever had because of the slaw  Sat at the bar and it was a good experience all around ,?
1624835,Had a 2:30 appointment for massage  foot detox and facial with a Groupon  but my morning plans fell through  I called and they were very accommodating  and let me come in early The atmosphere is very basic  but the service was absolutely fantastic!  The staff was friendly and courteous   The masseuse was very attentive and continued to check that pressure and everything was good   You get your choice between lotion and essential oils or both  and hot stones were also included at the end if you desired My facial was wonderful! It was rejuvenating and very moisturizing!   The aesthetician was very professional and performed at an excellent service!I left feeling relaxed and rejuvenated  and I will definitely be back!,?
1624940,Had a 70 inch Vizio TV that 2 other companies said was not repairable  Took it to them as a last ditch effort  Dropped it off for a free diagnostic at their shop  Staff was very friendly and helped get the TV from the car  They called me back within 3 days to say they can repair it  They replaced the one control board and repaired some solder joints on the main digitizer for way way less than a new TV  Would highly recommend them for any repairs before going out to buy a new TV ,?
1625328,Had a Hulk mask  mounted and framed and shipped to Tampa  FL  arrived on time  mask shifted a little due to shipping  they are offering to pay for a frame company to fix this piece  arrived packaged very well   Toby is great  she is so helpful  and great personality  cannot wait to due more business with them ,?
1625335,Had a Joeritto  LOVED it!  I will definitely go back!  The spam masubi was also great!  My unadventurous daughter got a cheeseburger and fries  and they were good as well   Yum!,?
1626445,Had a bowl of mac n cheese which was really good but expensive at $7 99  The dinner rolls are always stale and the bread always comes cold  Wish there were more fresh bread choices in the bakery besides just sourdough and bagels  We also had the tomato soup which was tasty and a sandwich on flat bread which came with kettle chips but those are not very good  They are salty but too crunchy and no flavor ,?
1626691,Had a business dinner here this week  The food was really good  I had a Steak Brown (Filet mignon  garlic  cracked black pepper  roasted shallot Cabernet butter) with a side of lobster mashed potatoes  Shared a couple bottles of satisfactory red wine with the group as well  The meal was a bit pricey  so probably not a place I would come to on my own  The service wasnt the greatest either  After desserts were ordered  took well over half hour to deliver them and one of the party members dessert was completely forgotten  I just ordered a latte  The waitress said they couldnt do this  they only had cappuccinos  But then I explained to her that a latte was same as a cappuccino  just without the froth  After she understand that  she accommodated my request  So  overall  an AOK place for a business meal  Not sure about much else beyond that ,?
1627032,Had a chemo treatment yesterday  so not in the best of moods Asked hostess for a seat away from noise  DoneWaiter was there immediately to get drinks  Perfect Ordered a burger  can you put the pickles and onion on the side  DoneChanged my mind and asked for another cheese  DoneKinda drank my tea fast  immediate fillup  PerfectFood arrived Hot and delicious  onion and pickles on the side PerfectStaff was excellent  food wonderful  Felt better when I left than when I came in  can not htank you enough ,?
1627805,Had a cupcake shake!  Yummy! A cupcake with their homemade ice cream   The carrot cake ice cream was awesome as well ,?
1629543,Had a genuinely pleasant experience here  When I arrived the place was large  decorated very well and had tons of seating  The cashier greeted me and was friendly while helping me choose my lunch and beverage  I ordered the Coconut Mango Greek Yogurt and a Large Iced Tea  Everything came out to less than $10  I went ahead and mixed the Elder Berry Hibiscus  Juicy Peach Acai Green tea with honey syrup at the station  It was a very refreshing combo and as an exbarista Ive had my fair share of teas  The Yogurt had fresh cut fruit  granola and was very filling  I enjoyed everything from the service to the selections and overall quality of food  You cant go wrong with ChopShop!,?
1629873,Had a good meal at Harbor Inn Seafood  Waitress was very good also  which always makes the meal better,?
1630264,Had a great breakfast and mimoasas here this morning after camping up in Cave Creek  Smoked salmon platter hit the spot and our server was attentive and very polite  Enjoyed very much!,?
1630970,Had a great evening and yummy foods! A must try are the pot stickers and chicken chili ! My favs! Great atmosphere   love the heaters outdoors and wait staff is so awesome and friendly!,?
1631030,Had a great experience all around here  The salesman (unfortunately forgot his name I think its Ed) was great and I never felt like he was hovering over us and hassling us buy something  He was very knowledgeable about the product he was selling as well as warranty coverage   We found a great sectional sofa in sale and arranged for delivery  Delivery time and date was confirmed with me twice via text message and the item was delivered as promised in perfect condition  The delivery drivers were extremely polite and very capable  They somehow managed to squeeze a giant three piece sectional sofa through my narrow second floor apartment door   It was a small miracle actually  We love the sofa which is really excellent quality for the price and fully warranted   The service all around was very good   Highly recommend this place ,?
1631063,Had a great experience at Angels Cafe   Yaquelin was a server  Kind and friendly and efficient    As for the food  it was fast and fresh and tasty too   I tried bacon and egg burrito which was enough for two meals   Husband and daughter had eggs n sausage breakfast meal  All good   Cant wait to come back to try dinner!!Love when I find a new place in town     whoop!,?
1631560,Had a great experience here so I figured Id set up the page  Impeccably clean  great location  choice accomodations  like a bed and breakfast but you get Crepes downstairs at the cafe or make your own (each suite has a kitchen  and the grocery next door is open until midnight ,?
1631592,Had a great experience here tonight! Dakota was awesome  He was super chill and easy going which made the environment extra comfortable  The patio area was dark and comfy  The fireplace gave it the perfect touch  The food was delicious  Chicken & Waffles (big portions and didnt disappoint  must try!)  Twice Baked Potato and Grilled Chicken Chopped Salad  Doug  the manager  even stopped by to make sure everything was going well and that we had everything we needed  Thanks guys  well be back!,?
1632727,Had a great experience  I needed a new fuel pump and it was replaced quickly and at a good price  Jason runs an honest shop  Ill be using them for all my car repairs and maintenance now ,?
1633027,Had a great lunch  bento box was very good our  service was also good would definitely recommend it,?
1633538,Had a great meal with family and friends out on the patio   Got the Bravo pasta and it basically was similar to a penne vodka  The fried ravioli appetizer was fantastic! Great outdoor space and looking forward to going back!,?
1633731,Had a great preChristmas Eve Child Burnout session at Xtreme Air today! Jazzy and Kassie checked us in at the front desk SUPER quick and took the Yelp coupon  no questions asked!  The waiver process is pretty cool you can actually fill it out on their website before you get there  like we did   Some people in our party didnt know to do that  but just used a kiosk right next to the front desk no wasting paper  which is solid   I sat in a quiet  comfy little lounge area near the front door and charged my phone while I waited for the little ones trampoline exercise to work its holiday magic   Therell be no creatures stirring in my house tonite!  Thank you  Xtreme Air for a truly silent night   :),?
1633747,Had a great reading with Lilly  She tells you exactly how it is and brings up things that are actually happening in your life that no one could have guessed  I hope to come back and have a Chakra reading ,?
1634041,Had a great time at $2 taco night! Great food! And service was amazing! Thanks to our server Lauren!,?
1634580,Had a great time here with family and friends  The headliner was GREAT imo  The food was pretty good  Im from the south so I judge harshly  But I had a great time  Im looking forward to it next year ,?
1634708,Had a great time here  If you are not a fan of spicy food this is NOT the place for you  I would say that we enjoyed the appetizers more than the entrees  The ambience was great as well as the service  I would recommend the cocktails!,?
1635622,Had a great  amazing back facial from Stacey early this year  Stacey took time to understand my needs and my skin type  This was very different for me but something I would recommend for everyone  I cant wait to visit Stacey office again ,?
1636007,Had a homemade root beer  mint chocolate chip sundae  the Bob Feller sundae (with salted French caramel ice cream)  Root beer was awesome  salted French caramel ice cream was really buttery  but overall  ice cream is still way too sweet for my liking  I never usually leave a bowl of ice cream with some still left in it  but I just couldnt take the sweetness overload  Sadly left my bowl with a good amount of ice cream still in it ,?
1636268,Had a junior suite  and the view was spectacular  We had a view of the pool with the MGM Signature hotel towers  The movie screen was epic as we listened to music while pregaming  The bathroom was beyond spacious and welcoming  The toilet was black which I guess can be viewed as a good thing and a bad thing depending on your stance and the number of drinks  The gigantic bathtub was in the bedroom and it was beyond comfortable  The space was overall very accommodating from the kitchen to the washer/dryer to the amazing bed and couches  The pool was average  nothing to fancy about it  I enjoyed the starbucks in the lobby  Check in service was good as well ,?
1636800,Had a light dinner here one recent weeknight  Had Da Gouda and tater tots with the 3 sauces  There was no one in the restaurant  however the manager was very friendly and my order arrived promptly  The sandwich was bursting with flavor and it was obvious they used quality ingredients  Thumbs up!,?
1637593,Had a ministaycation in Gilbert this weekend   We started at a big bar in the evening  but decided we werent ready for that   So we walked over to Joyride Saturday night and had the best experience!!  We were seated immediately in a cute little restaurant w great views of Downtown Gilbert   We ordered fish tacos  spicy chicken nachos  and then had several margaritas   One of us had the regular house marg  which was great but the other two of us had the cucumber Serrano margs which were FANTASTIC!!  At one point  we also had tequila shots and our waiter Hunter tracked me down some cinnamon to make them to my request   Our service was AMAZING (thanks Michael and Hunter) and we just had a great time!!  Would highly recommend and definitely come back!,?
1637806,Had a nice beer and pretzels while waiting to pick up someone at the airport  The pretzels were on the bland side with a tasty horseradish mustard  We also got cheese on the side but probably didnt need it  We thought maybe it could have been Costco frozen pretzels  It also took a long time to make  However that said  the wait staff were all really warm and friendly  Didnt have other food so cant give a full review  But go grab a beer !,?
1638204,Had a paint night here and had such an amazing time! Still have my glass    people were fun and sweet  as well as very informative about their wine!,?
1638612,Had a pretty bad experience  The food was good   but the service made us feel rushed and unwelcome  Dishes were picked up from the table before everyone was finished  while some were still chewing on the last bite    Later  our deserts were waiting to be served on the bar next to us for 56 minutes (it didnt affect their quality  just annoying)  Will probably not be coming back  even though we liked the pizza  and also their interpretation of cannoli  Its just not worth getting the kind of cold treatment that you receive here  Get your Italian somewhere else ,?
1638626,Had a pretty disappointing experience today  Three of us went to get breakfast  Ordered a latte  tasted like all milk  Had them remake it  but they left out the flavoring and their espresso tasted like cigarettes  (I walked over to Cupka Joe to get a good espresso drink after I left ) We ordered a cheese danish (this is was stale)  a breakfast sandwich on wheat (it was 90% bread) and they forget the bacon  My wife ordered bacon and eggs and her bacon tasted like it was bad and her avocado was old (brown and spotted)  The coffee they ordered was bad too  The table next to us send back their meals for some sort of correction as well  We will not be returning ,?
1638702,Had a pretty phenomenal experience eating at the bar the other day  The Bartender had everything on point  couldnt have ask for anything more  Bartenders name I think is TK  he suggested I try a Lychee Martini  Was Soooo good  Had the Sashimi Special  gotta say was way better than expected  Overall great experience  5/5,?
1638910,Had a quick bite before heading for an evening meeting  ordered chirashi don for take out  For $18 99  no salad or soup included  but every piece is very fresh good grade sashimi  it gives you the value  Wasabi is not those ayce wasabi  its the fresh wasabi stem  Sushi rice is alright but it needs a bit more balance of the rice vinegar  Overall I would recommend this restaurant but not in the beat location you would find ,?
1639734,Had a reservation at 6:30 tonight   We were greeted promptly and told theyd be with us shortly   15 minutes later wed not been seated and several groups walked right in and were promptly seated  Wed been here before and the food was good  but wont be going back after this experience ,?
1640142,Had a shattered Galaxy S4 screen  this place had the cheapest rates in the valley for a better quality product (gorilla glass vs  Regular glass)  Good store hours so I didnt have to take off work and able to fix it within an hour  Also didnt try to overcharge by unessecarily replacing the LCD which was fine ,?

1641270,Had a very delicious meal here  The ikura combo with kara miso was my favourite  Service was good and the place is very neat  We went later in the night and didnt have to wait for a table of 4  The bowl of ramen is not too big  but was enough  However  if your really hungry maybe upsize  Would revisit again ,?
1641573,Had a very nice dinner at Fiamma  The variety in the bread basket is nice   The wine selection is good  We both had the chefs favorites tasting plate  I wouldnt do that plate again   I would go straight for the Agnolotti Beef  Veal  and Pork Ravioli  Wild Mushroom  with Veal Demi  The other two items on the plate: Gnocchi with Lobster and Orecciette were just ok for me but my husband thoroughly enjoyed  The baked cauliflower was also good  We opted to share the Tiramisu for dessert  and I would have liked to have the whole thing to myself!! So good The night we were there they had someone coming around to take photos of diners and then the photos  were available for purchase about 30 minutes later  We had them taken only to find out that the cost would be $90!  Id rather not be bothered during my meal  especially when I have my own camera available to capture our memories ,?

1645861,Had an excellent meal here   Went there for my Graduation from CPCC with family and all of the food choices we had were delicious   My favorite would be the Barbque queso   We choose  to go with the pulled pork  but I am sure the brisket would have been good also   My smoked turkey was moist and very thick sliced Friendly staff made for a great dining experience with our four year old   I would recommend for both couples out for a drink and families with children also  If there was one complaint is was that their small parking lot is full most of the time  but that doesnt seem like a problem at all now does it?,?

We are not fans of heavily sauced bbq so we dont go out for bbq often because thats how most places serve it  The meat here is not slathered in sauce  It is smoky  flavorful  tender and delicious  The brisket is my fav!

1671606,Had the worst experience with this dealer   Dominique the general manager was extremely rude  No customer service skills whatsoever  I would never ever suggest this dealer  As purchasing a car is the second most expensive purchase anyone makes  the dealer should not rip you off by overcharging ,?

1672675,Had this place bookmarked to try  Finally did today  It was pretty good  The inside could look a little better and the sign on the outside is rather small but I ended with getting a 7 in chicken philly and some fries  The fries were okay  I couldve had the sandwich without them and the chicken philly was pretty good  I would go again if I was in the area but if not in the area prob not  The people were kinda friendly and its all subs ,?
1673192,Had to come here to get a Banh mi fix when Les sandwiches closed up early cause they sold out of everything  Pretty sketchy place  Some weird happenings going on in the back room  Maybe gambling  maybe something else  Who knows  People are smoking inside as this place also sells smokes on the side  As for the Banh mi  they arent anything special in fact they are pretty skimpy on the meat and veggies  Pretty small in comparison to Les Sandwiches not too far away and more expensive  Probably would never come back here  As a side note the place next door has some really weird old Vietnamese ladies singing their karaoke ,?
1674157,Had to make a run to a truck stop to pick up a part for a project that I was watching my buddy do   I also had to pick up some chow for the boy   Figured I would go to the ole faithful that is DT   I was in a happy place so I did not care if it was Friday night and the location was on the strip  Despite all the cars this place is dialed and the line moved right along   The servers were super friendly to boot ,?

I also ordered a veggie spring roll  asked if it was like the ones at rice paper  their sister restaurant  and again told yes  No   it was basically lettuce sprouts and asparagus and no vermicelli noodles at all! Hands down rice paper downtown is the best!!! Very cute interior though at slanted rice   I will try it our for dinner ,?

1679045,Hands Down the Best Coffee Ever!!I went to the Sambalatte that is located in the Monte Carlo hotel  I decided to try this coffee establishment because I saw a recommendation from a trip advisor  I tried the iced hazelnut latte  and I must say that this was the best coffee EVER! Rich and sweet with a strong nutty flavor  I am a person that usually thinks coffee is coffee  but this coffee was incredible  I had to have it every day of our trip  which was quite a walk  we were staying at Harrahs! I would have given this establishment 5 stars  but I did encounter the coffee Nazi when I almost grabbed the wrong coffee and the counter person screamed that coffee not for you!  Not terrible customer service  comical  but still not nice,?

1680926,Hands down my favorite brewery in Charlotte   Been coming here a little more than 2 years and the flavors never get old   My favorite beers are the Smoked Amber  Light Rail Pale Ale  or the Greenway IPA   In the summer I make sure not to miss a pint of Hyzer Hefewiezen while it is on tap Great outdoor or indoor seating and they always have the best games on TV with awesome music   On Thursday nights they have Triple C Beer Runners or Yoga in the warehouse so you can get some exercise in with great people before having a pint   Most days of the week there is a food truck outside in case you get hungry   Great setup  beers  and staff!!!,?
1681022,Hands down my favorite hot pot restaurant in the GTA  Mainly because their herbal broth makes a huge difference and theyre really fast in bringing the beef and lamb dishes  However  their buffet section where you help yourself to get the food is a little messy  this year they made also their hot pot sauce (peanut sauce  bbq sauce etc) more and more diluted that its almost watery ,?
1681376,Hands down my favorite tortillas ever  Soo delicious the food there is great too  I get some of the pork and rice and a bag of tortillas   Booom I got a great meal  Im drooling  thinking about this place again,?

1684081,Hands down the best chiropractor Ive had yet! I was dealing with some lower back and neck issues for 2 months or so  I was referred to Dr  Wu and on my first visit  he adjusted me and gave me an assortment of stretches and tips to help my lower back pain subside  I have been back to Beyond Rehab twice since (while doing what he suggested between visits) and my back feels great! Dr  Wu knows what he is doing and the Beyond Rehab staff will take good care of you on your visits  Easy 5 out of 5 for me ,?
1684175,Hands down the best corned beef hash Ive ever had in my life  I could eat here everyday  And I did  while we were in Vegas earlier this week  We only have one of these places in California and I REALLY wish there was more  My husband ordered the grilled cheese and he loved it!

1687700,Hands down  one of the best sandwiches ever!  You gotta get the Tuna Melt   Unreal!!!!  A visit to Vegas without stopping at Earls is a waste   Its located in Planet Hollywood,?
1687908,Hands down  the best Thai food I have ever had  Located in the commercial center with two other very well regarded Thai restaurants  I wasnt sure how well this place was going to do  It definitely deserves a spot among the best The ambiance is classy without being uptight  The wicker chairs are a pleasure to sit in  The service was prompt  Everything was clean  The Short Rib Yellow Curry is where its at  This will not disappoint  The rib has plenty of tender meat that melts in your mouth  The roasted vegetables pair wonderfully with the curry  Spoon that curry on everything  I went with medium spice for the curry and got the perfect blend of taste and heat  The Arawan Pad Thai is presented like a work of art  Beautiful crisscross pattern and its loaded with prawns  The prices are a bit higher than other Thai restaurants but its definitely worth it  The atmosphere  the presentation  the food  This place has it and at a reasonable price ,?
1688687,Handsdown absolutely the worst car wash I have ever used in my life and an absolute waste of money and time that I will never get back what a waste of life going to this place ,?
1688843,Handsdown the slowest Starbucks I have ever been to  The staff talks way too much to each other instead of working  When you have A drivethrough full of cars and a store filled with people waiting in line maybe talking and goofing around is not the answer to getting people out faster  I dont know why I torture myself and keep going back there  But after waiting a total of 27 minutes for one drink I think Ive learned my lesson  And this was not the first time ,?
1689175,Hanks is AMAZING in every way  Our service team was witty  charming and full of personality  They definitely made our night! I mentioned that I like Moscow Mules and they recommended a mule thats not on the menu  It had fresh  muddled jelapenos    it was even better than the original we ordered! The food was phenomenal as well  The crab cocktail and sweet corn are both MUST HAVES! Our filets were cooked to absolute perfection  respectively  I will most definitely be back ,?
1689349,Hannah is amazing  She is professional and caring  I look forward to my services with her  The salon is enjoyable and relaxing for me ,?
1689481,Hannys is an amazing interior! It looks very OhIminLAorNewYork inside  However  our dinner did not match up to the tasteful decor of the restaurant  in fact  taste was the problem! Who called the pizza a giant saltine? Its true! Worse  all the ingredients were dumped indifferently onto the top  and the flavors were obscured by each other! Our pizza tasted like an arugula salad slathered in Chef Boyardee tomato sauce  The drinks were a nice source of amusement  We didnt order alcohol  but when we requested refills  the waiter looked mortified and said I can only give you ONE! This place has the potential to be the goto of downtown Phoenix  but theyve got to tune up the menu  or they are going to be a big empty mens store once again!,?
1689828,Happened to be stuck in Pittsburgh due to weather and followed the reviews here  Totally worth it  Everything looked great  but I opted for the 2 egg breakfast w/ sausage and rye toast with a side of the French toast  Man  Im stuffed but it was all excellent  Its difficult to take a diner breakfast and elevate it beyond good  but they really pull it off here  Eggs were obviously fresh and perfectly cooked  sausage was just a step above your normal sausage link in quality and flavor  and the French Toast was just superb  I just wish I still had room for the baklava  it looks awesome ,?
1690282,Happiness that you can purchase in a paper cup (or waffle bowl) They have Red velvet  chocolate  birthday cake   Toppings galore Menchies seems to be expanding with new locations popping up all over the place Just in time for summer!  And this location has a large front window that opens up to the street   The service here is friendly  theres always a steady stream of customers I might have to start walking on the other side of the street to cut down on froyo intake I heart Menchies!   D,?
1690781,Happy Hour is still great  and you cant go wrong with the Pub Board  The last few times weve been in  you can tell the service is slipping  The waitstaff and bartenders seem to be way more interested in each other than the customers ,?
1691007,Happy Mess was great! Truffle fries   yum  Like the casual atmosphere  I think I was the oldest guy there!,?
1691056,Happy Pets Palace is great  My Belgian Malinois just did a second day here and it was great  Lots of play time and fun activity with the other dogs  The staff is great and they really care about all the dogs like they were theirs  Molly gets home and she is tired from all the activity   Definitely a good place to bring your dog if you are working long hours  Convenient hours as well  Highly recommend Happy Pets Palace!!!,?
1691185,Happy customer here   They showed up   Covered things up and went to work   Pretty thorough   Price is on the higher end but I believe in You get what you pay for   Those companies that offer the job for 100200 dollars I would stay away from ,?
1691435,Happy hour between 37pm is THE BEST deal ever!!! My husband and I ordered bottomless chips&salsa  chicken wings  mini pepperoni pizza  burger  bacon cheese fries  small Caesar salad and 2 beers(of course we couldnt finish em all   )  They are all under the happy hour menu   The best part? Our bill was under $30!! I think the burger was $7 but everything else on the happy hour menu is like $3 and $4  And the portion isnt bad at all  Mini pizza was like kids size 4 pieces pizza  but burger was big like regular burgers! We loved the deal I put 4 stars in stead of 5 because the happy hour menu is only available at bar area  and we had a baby with us and wish we could sit at dining area  But we went around 4:30pm on weekday so it wasnt too busy  we had good service and yummy food  Would love to go there again :),?
1691777,Happy hour is great  Lamb chop fondue with truffle cream sauce is out of this world  Filet mignonette sliders were amazing ,?
1692653,Happy to note that a new Vietnamese eatery has been added to north Phoenix  and conveniently located on Bell Rd  just off I17  Wondering why they decided to call it a bistro rather than just a restaurant  I decided to give it a try  Its definitely cozy  smaller than most Vietnamese eateries in the Valley but its very clean and has a bit of a trendy look  The menu selection is smaller than in most Vietnamese restaurants  which is a good thing actually  it makes ordering easier  and the simple menu is displayed in 2 screens just over the counter  They do serve Asian shaved ice and milk teas  which is definitely a plus  The food is tasty  full of the refreshing savoryherbal flavors characteristic of the cuisine  and inexpensive  which is an important consideration for me  Another bonus: WiFi is available!,?
1692789,Happy to see this location under new ownership  Sparkly clean  air conditioned  and great drop off service  My comforters came back looking and smelling clean and fresh for a great price with a quick turn around  The new owner is friendly and has an interest in being part of the community and offering quality service ,?
1693807,Hard to knock this place its a traditional Wiscounsin bar/resturant great food and large portions this is the place that the locals go most patrons know each other I had the cod special and the hash browns and it was fresh and portions were large this place gives you a great value for the money  LOVED IT!,?
1694442,Harris Cars is the best Car dealership out there  This family owned business treats their customers like family and really go the extra mile  Frank and Tommy and everyone there was so helpful and nice  I was really hesitant at first to buy my car from a used dealer  but after this expereience I would do it again in a heartbeat  They are not the pushy sales type at all they dont need to be! They have quality cars and are not going to sell you a lemon  I would definately buy my next vehicle from Harris Cars and recommend everyone to them  They have great cars  they are professional  knowledgeable and just really good people,?
1694570,Harry and Lilly are the best!!! We are locals and rented two jet skis this past weekend from them  and everything went super smooth  Very straightforward  accommodating and kind people  Best rates in town and family owned and operated  We will continue to go back to them time and time again   Thank you Harry for the great experience!!,?
1694995,Has a variety of options with regards to equipment which I like compared to the Ajax locations  It has indoor swimming and outdoor basketball court which is a plus! However the staff were not very friendly or even acknowledged when people were coming in and going out    The towels need to be replaced cause you could see yellow spots and they just look dirty   other then that If you just want to workout its a great place ,?
1695237,Has been for many many years  the best place for Breakfast Burritos as well as Mexican Food  Lived here for over 30 years and every time Im in town I have to go here  Like I said BEST BREAKFAST BURRITOS!,?
1696325,Hate going to the dentist    This place has been awesome though! Everyone is extra friendly and polite!! They all take time to explain things fully  No shadiness  Helpful payment plans too!,?
1697002,Hats off to the creators of Bottega Louie for bringing this restaurant to Las Vegas!!  Delicious food  great spirits  and awesome service   Dined here for about 3 5 hours the other day and saying that I had a blast would definitely be an understatement   Check this place out for yourselves    trust me  you wont be disappointed ,?
1697475,Have a smoothie here wasnt that wowed by it  Fresh ingredients though  The girls behind the counter were NOT friendly though ,?
1698037,Have been a fan of the Rocky River location for many years  but was hesitant to try the new North Olmsted location due to some of the negative reviews   Im happy to report that tonight we tried the North Olmsted location and had an outstanding experience   Our waiter  Jackson  was very attentive   The food took just long enough for our family to get a good card game in and have some good family time   The pizzas we ordered were delicious   This will be a new favorite spot for us   This area has been lacking a good eatin pizza place with good atmosphere   Happy to have Danny Boys close by ,?
1698415,Have been coming here for 3 years now  Staff is excellent and the doctor is great  I can get my retinas looked at without getting dilated  Costs me $30 but so what  Sure beats walking around with eyes wide shut for the rest of the day!  They have a good  not great  selection of frames but in the grand scheme of things the more choices the harder it is to pick  Right?,?
1698596,Have been coming here for years its close to my house and the staff is friendly  Its a good place for sushi and the prices are reasonable ))) this was my review a month ago  Two days ago my father went to pick up some rolls and sushi and the staff was very rude to him ( he had a stroke few years ago his speech is not perfect) they were very rude  The food on the other hand went from 9  3 real quick after the management changed   Not fresh tasted bad     the rolls were so bad it was like vending machine food  You can get better sushi n rolls from Smiths  such a let down ,?
1699065,Have been eating here since they opened a few years ago  Great food and service  Very friendly and helpful  Carnitas are off the hook  Recommend this to anyone wanting good real Mexican food ,?
1699497,Have been going there quite a bit over the years    when corporate took over quality of food has gone down  smaller portions  less value  higher prices    lost hometown feel  Now you can tell its all about money   not the customer  They still do have the best patio around  Ill give them that ,?
1699878,Have been having Petes since I was a child  Go for the extremely battered fried shrimp its so addicting  This place is the spot to get fried food the Place for Deep Fried Goodness  You can order fried shrimp  fried scallops  fried mushrooms  fried burritos  etc     all with a side of fried potatoes (French fries)  Bring cash because thats all they take ,?
1699931,Have been here 3 times and got 1 meal that was edible  You would think that I would learn  The place is very nice and the staff seems to be doing a good job but the food is mediocre at best  Cant understand why you have to present a credit card before you even get a drink  Makes you feel like a crook so I guess they have a lot of undesirables bolting  not paying their bill  I think 1 out of 3 is enough to keep me from returning ,?
1700067,Have been here a couple times now   food comes fast and is really good  tho i wish they had all you can eat   So why only 3 stars? Both times i have come here i have had the same waitress who has ZERO personality!  So much so that it made us feel really uncomfortable   She barely says anything to you and instead of asking if we were ready to order  she walked up to the table and just stared at me until i got uncomfortable enough to just order   Despite having tasty food  i dont know if we will come back ,?
1700204,Have been here a few times now and always  enjoy it   The service is efficient the staff are typically friendly and the sandwiches and the Kimchi fries are amazing  Wear your jacket  every time the door opens you freeze!,?
1700887,Have been here several times and living in North Glendale  this has become my go to for good pulled pork sandwich   Have been to Dillons and Thee Pitts on Bell Road and 55th ish and this place is better than both   Only place I like better in the valley is Honey Bears but it is too far away from my home   Though it looks good  skip the rocky road brownie   Not as good as it looks ,?
1701042,Have been here several times  First time the service struggled a bit  but has continually improved on each visit  I love visiting in the warmer months with my pugs :) They love the chicken and rice bowl here  I have found that I love the lavash (vegetarian) and this can easily be made vegan  Its light but filling at the same time  Drinks are also good ,?
1701416,Have been here twice  The first time great  however this time soso  Asked for my dishes spicy  Not what I received  The chicken in the tiki masala was terrible  I dont think I will be back ,?
1701932,Have been sitting here for 20 minutes and no service at all    Talked to the manager and he said we could leave if we wanted to    Total bs service here     ,?
1702238,Have been to The Fork 3 times now   Incredible staff  friendly managers and great food!  I worked in the restaurant industry for quite some time and I really think they know what they are doing!,?
1702497,Have been to a number of these  but today was the first time in awhile   Great family event with tons of arts  crafts  performances  and of course great food   Parking is a little bit of chore if you dont get here at the opening bell (I recommend parking on 20th Street along Granada Park)  but once youre inside its pretty easy to get around   The dance performances in the main stage area are an especially great treat   The food and drink lines can get long  but move pretty fast   In terms of food choices  I recommend the dolmades (grape leaves stuffed with beef and rice)  saganaki (flambeed cheese & wine)  souvlaki (chicken or pork skewers)  and the baklava sundae (yes  thats right  baklava mixed with ice cream)   Highly recommend coming at or near the opening bell if you wanna avoid the bigger crowds   All in all  a great valley event beaming with tradition  great for Greeks and nonGreeks alike ,?
1703365,Have been wanting to try this place for a long time now so finally stopped in for dinner   Staff is friendly and attentive live music is a keyboard player so that was a downer for sure   Had BBQ agave wings which were cooked perfect but for our personal taste had little to much sauce   Then ordered a medium the works overall the pizza was pretty good had a little issue with the texture of the ground meat but I think we will be back ,?
1703953,Have dropped by here on the way to work a couple of times now   Staff is super friendly and quick   Bagels are soft and chewy  I am a super fan of the Nosh Veggie on sesame   Hoping to have the time to get to sit and have breakfast their soon and try some of the yummy food I have seen ,?
1704365,Have eaten here several times and have never been disappointed  The menu is pretty large and Ive always enjoyed what Ive ordered  This last time I ordered the vegan club sandwich which was mouthwatering  I look forward to my next visit!,?
1704890,Have gone there a couple of times in the past few months  Once with a group from work and once with my 22 year old daughter  Never had a problem   Some staff could be ball******* but who cares  Big selection could be a little cleaner  but they do get lot of traffic Taking the range portion of my CCL at another range so lets see how they compare  I have no complaints Follow up: went again tonight with my daughter 2 months later  Same guy took care of us  think his name is Greg  and remembered us  Couldnt have been nicer  Greeted us  engaged in conversation  and urged us to come back   You may want to give it a second chance ,?
1705123,Have had a couple of dealings with the parts department   Both instances were for smaller items and less than $25    The guys in the department treats everyone with helpful and friendly attitudes    They take the time to find the parts you need and even calls you when the part is in   I have dealt with many auto parts departments and this without any doubt is the most professional one When I when for my last delivery there was a family ahead of me with a wheel chair bound child   Instead of having the family wait for the mechanics to install the parts man when to their van and installed the part himself   This got this family on the way home quicker   He did it without any fanfare I am extremely pleased with my experiences here ,?
1705185,Have had amazing experience with this company! Makes dry cleaning so convenient having a locker in the apartment  Great customer service as well ,?
1705422,Have had nothing but difficulty with this bank  they got my business by claiming that they were a real community type bank  They are not  all employees we met with when we opened the account have been replaced a couple of times  Judging by the high turnover and the lack of intelligence in half of the staff  i think i will be moving to a Credit Union as soon as my partner gets back to town and we can move the business account ,?
1705585,Have had their carne asada plate  their quesadillas  camarones a la diabla & their breaded shrimp & I have to say its probably one of the best Mexican seafood restaurants in town(not to mention I can walk there from where I live)  Its also across the street from Freedom Park so you can always take a walk after youre done eating ,?
1706158,Have never enjoyed going to the dentist until I started going here a few years ago  Everyone is so friendly & they do an awesome job  The dental techs and Dr  are all gentle and thorough! Great experience every time I go ,?
1706557,Have not eaten here but the coffee is great  the people serving are genuinely nice and friendly and the atmosphere of the cafe is warm and inviting ,?
1706895,Have only done happy hours there recently and our go to items are the house red  gnocchi  arancini and pizza dough slices   the average ranking is for the spotty service  First no happy hour menu  taking forever for drink refills  list goes on  Especially when  its 3pm and there are two tables inside ,?
1707390,Have seen Dr  Pearson 3 times in 3 years   I have never had an issue   He seems to truly care about my eye health   As long as he continues to go to the Mesa location I will continue to brave Fiesta Mall to see him ,?
1707407,Have seen many commercials for this place and was looking forward to trying it  Absolute disappointment! The waitress was unorganized and unaware of our complete dissatisfaction  Portion size was small for the price  I ordered the grilled salmon ceasar salad  The salmon was bland and the lettuce was wilted  I should have complained but the manager was to busy with other upset customers  Dont eat here ,?
1707573,Have stayed at this hotel numerous times The rooms are great The gym is fantastic   Theres a mini restaurant right outside the gym on the 4th floor   perfect for a healthy meal   The iced cold brewed coffee is excellent For quick meals   the Lux (main floor) seemed to work out great for the team As I worked the entire Vegas visit   I never left the hotel for food/fun anywhere other than the hotel PS  Theres an outdoor pool which I never saw as there was no time for it  but it looked like tanned people (damn them!) were having a great time ,?
1708145,Have to do this  Im Asian and I know Thai food  Bad food here  wrong order  average   service!,?
1708752,Have to try this place its insane how many flavors they can pack into the food  Its amazing and best ramen ever!!,?
1708831,Have tried The Oink Cafe three times in the past month with mixed success  I have zero complaints about the entrees  All three times it arrived hot and tasty  We got two of the bacon topped donuts to go because they looked amazing  but they were truly horrible  Took two bites and trashed the rest  The hostess I had today seemed to be in a fowl mood  Ignored us when we first came in  She seemed more interested in whatever she was working on at the podium  Finally said a total of one word  2? Then we waited about 15 minutes before a waitress came around and it was not busy  She was sweet and helpful once she got to us  On my second visit the waitress seemed to have way too many tables or something  She did get our order in and was very pleasant but then we didnt see her again  The manager was there thankfully and stepped in and got our bill  I think Oink really needs to work on customer service  Not sure Id go back ,?
1713052,Havent witnessed such a lack of regard since the Timmys at sherbourne & Richmonds levita  Ordered a smoothie  it took at least 12 minutes in there  They shouted out lemonade smoothie and no one responded  Then this small cashier gave the drink a once over again and shouted mango pineapple   Twas mine   I sipped it all the way to the subway platform   I realized there was no yogurt in the drink and returned to the Timmys I told them it was not made properly and I felt a large amount of sass from the lady who made it  But what was she even upset about? Making me wait so long for a poorly made beverage that I paid $4 for??? Lady  U can keep your sass to yourself   Ill keep my twoonies This Tims is really slow  only go on lunch break when u get 1 hour away  Dont go unless Ur  at gunpoint,?
1713371,Having a delicious lunch before I go into work!  Started my lunch off with a free mango lassi! Check in on yelp for a free mango lassi or soda!  So yummy! Always great service too!,?
1713459,Having a grocery store within walking distance of your house is a luxury that people often take for granted  Having a few of them within the same distance is a blessing that I will appreciate beyond belief  Smiths might not be my first choice for groceries  but I will go in from time to time to compare them to the competitor across the street and when I am too lazy to go to TJ I like that I can get in and out without much hassle and once in a while they have some great pantry stocking sales ,?
1713781,Having been a 20 year patient  starting with Dr Lubber  then Dr Cummings and now Dr Heck I called today to make an appointment because I received a letter it was time to come in  I was told it would be a two month wait to see Dr Heck  and six weeks to see; first available   Dr Lubber  Is it time to add more staff?  I have had outstanding care and would love to continue my relationship with SW Skin Specialist  but you have left this patient no choice but to go elsewhere  Robert D EvansScottsdale,?
1714409,Having been to all of the Dos Gringos in the valley  Im tied for my favorite between here  and the south Tempe location(priest) I love the outdoor tiki bar vibe they have going  and the bartenders/ servers are usually fun and engaging  Not at all a typical Scottsdale bar  in fact  the very opposite  Usually very friendly crowd :) I love margaritas and if you get here during happy hour  they have awesome deals! Regular  flavored  frozen  on the rocks  you pick  there all delish(even though from a mix  not overly sweet)  The food is actually really good  I love the burros  tacos  nachos  gringo rolls  etc never a bad choice for a fun night out  or drinks with friends:),?
1714696,Having breakfast with family and Carlos Alexis the birthday boy   Great place to come   Super fast service   Amber great help explaining menu and detail and super patient   Good place to come for breakfast and lunch  Had ACE EGGS BENEDICT   delicious   Pancakes super soft and bomb ,?
1715452,Having grown up with a German mother who made great German food  Im always skeptical of German restaurants   Id heard and read good things about Haus Murphys so we decided to try it   We were very pleasantly surprised!  The food was the best Id had this side of moms   I had the Roladen and my girl friend had the Paprika Schnitzel  both were excellent   The side dishes were good to above average and the beer we chose at the suggestion of our waiter  John (sp?)  was also excellent   John was engaging  friendly  and very helpful in all respects  without being intrusive   We will definitely go back!,?
1715836,Having just moved from Texas to Toronto  we were excited to see this place close to the house  but the food was a real disappointment  Even the salsa seemed to come from a can ,?
1716621,Having moved from Toronto to a small town  I was worried about the lack of decent restaurants that were near us  This place is just great! Its walking distance from our home  the patio is epic  the service is awesome and the food is your typical pub grub  comfy and tasty  I love their  $5 caesar menu on Sundays and their skillet calamari is a must try,?
1717944,Having the ability to order through the new mobile app is definitely not only a game changer but a life changer  Ordering is a breeze and youre able to customize your order any way you want  If you want a ChickfilA sandwich with no pickles but bacon and cheese instead go for it  the app is your oyster  One of the best features of the app is curbside pickup  I can order my food when im still in a nearby store or leaving work and have it ready to be delivered to my car or pickup in store when I get there  No more waiting in long lines in store or through the drivethru  Does it get much better than that?It also goes without saying the their customer service at this location is hands down one of the best experiences out there today  Customer service is always consistently great and everyone is beyond friendly   I cant give them enough compliments on that alone ,?
1718161,Having tried Mexican food in Corpus Christi Texas  Im pretty confident when I say Ive had authentic Mexican food  and this place has legit Mexican food  Ive tried several different Mexican food places in Charlotte  but this one is by far my favorite  Freshly made food daily  great seasonings  generous portions  decent prices   Give this place a try!,?
1719063,He charge me for the oil change teams and nothing else Great experience! He charged me for the oil change and nothing else   That is the first time that I havent been tried to talk into a filter change or other services  which I really appreciate as a young single female who doesnt know what is legit! I will definitely be returning,?
1719090,He did a good job on my pedi  I would recommend coming here  Granted it is in a walmart but other then that tit was nice they did a great job with the scrub and massage  And its really not expensive at all  So if youre in walmart and have time I say come in and get a pedi ,?
1719611,He seemed very knowledgeable and had a decent bedside manner and his staff was polite and professional for the most part   We had a procedure scheduled and called to see if we could get a diagnostic procedure scheduled instead   Still waiting to hear back from them ,?
1719805,He was very friendly  personable   and measured quickly   I trusted him in my home and I trust his expertise  ,?
1721996,Heard about this place from my Caucasian coworkers who frequent Thelmas and they love it! Its a little far of a drive for me but when Im in the area Ill be sure to fix my Filipino Food craving with this  Theyre not turoturo style unlike most Filipino fast food so their food tastes a little more fresh and like home  Its not too oily and has pretty good flavor  I ordered to go and waited about 10 mins for my chicken adobo and sinigang soup  For one order of adobo I got 4 large chicken thighs I feel like I couldve cooked this myself for $5 (in terms of quantity) but alas you do pay for convenience  The sinigang was delicious definitely was the base to a fish sinigang  I think its one of my better choices for Filipino food here in town ,?
1722399,Heard good things about the restaurant and the chef   I went by myself to get a table  and told I had to wait 10 minutes for a seat at the bar   2 other guys walk in and are seated right away at the bar  then the hostess proceeds to tell me she will check to see when I can be seated   Poor service  and unfortunately waited 15 minutes and never got to try the food   Hire help that cares!,?
1722652,Heard great things  so I was excited to give it a try! Very cute place with unique donut flavors and lots of sauce choices for the chicken  I ended up getting a breakfast sandwich  the south by southwest: interesting flavor but I cant say Im hooked  Really wanted to try the vegan ramen but it was pricey  Also  all of the chicken is bonein so if thats not your thing then it might be better to skip ,?
1722732,Heard many good things about the place so dropped in at 12h30  Not very busy  no line  few customers   Rating is a 1 star because it took 25 minutes to get my order of a single pizza prepared  I recognize this is not a fast food place  but had to get it packed and ate it about 5 hours later since I had to get back to work etc For the food  I would rate at 3 stars: the idea of the cauliflower crust is very original The menu is extensive and likely too large and customizable for a staff of what looked like 2 in the kitchen ,?
1723002,Heard so much about the Patio at Against the Grain from fellow Yelpers after the CMYE that I missed   I am dying to check out the place    and of course the Patio!Civic Holiday Monday for a late lunch    ATG was not too busy but there was still a wait for a table on the patio  The bartender was amazing giving my Yelp Drinking Buddy free sample of some of the beers on tap  My Vodka cocktail ($11) is on the pricey side from was refreshing and made from freshly squeezed juice!Pull Pork Tacos ($12) was AOK    soft  tender and seasoned well   Great as a snack!! For sure it tasted better than my friends Angus Burger    I am glad that we were not sharing!! :)Love the deco and the location and the view!! ATGs patio has one of the best view I ever been!! A great meet up place to hang out with friends!Great daily specials after 4 pm    who doesnt like specials?!!ATG might be a little out of the way  but if you are in the area it worth your while to drop by for a drink!,?
1723207,Heard the wind and string sections as we were wandering by Cleopatras Barge at Caesars Palace   We slipped in  grabbed a table and were BLOWN AWAY   How is it possible we could listen to amazing live music  stellar vocals  and amazing renditions of our favorite hits for the price of a cocktail or two   David loves what he does and it shows   What a fun orchestra filled with smiling and friendly faces and sound that just makes you want to get up and dance   Well find them the next time were in town!!  Get a seat and enjoy!,?
1723507,Heart! Love! Yum!  Definitely my favorite buffet in Vegas!! D,?
1723540,Hearthstone is a cute and trendy place to have happy hour or a birthday dinner!Ive experienced both  but have to say their service is kinda slow so prepare to sit down and wait not just eat and leave in a jiffy  Weve gone to celebrate my moms birthday with a party of 10  We ordered so much food for the table we had leftovers  Ive tried the Rotisserie Chicken  Fried calamari and Tuna Tartare all were amazing  Plus they had a live performance on Saturday night while wining and dining  Kudos to that!As for Steak tartare bites  cheese pizza & wings for happy hour theyre totally worth it for the price! Plus wine on tap for half the price equals double score!,?
1723547,Hearthstone is awesome! This restaurant is very unique and can not be compared to other restaurants in Vegas! The ambiance of the place is amazing  Everything is clean  the lighting is perfect and the music is great! The food is delicious and has so much flavor and creativity! The service provided by the staff is quite the experience  they treat everyone like a VIP  provided knowledge of the menu and accommodated my every needs  Heartstone is one of the best restaurants Ive had the chance of dining in!,?
1723610,Hearty breakfasts  excellent service   I ordered the NY steak and eggs plus a side of  pancakes (because the sweet tooth needs to be satisfied)   Pancakes were delicious and fluffy  Ginomous!  Shoulda stuck with one single stack   Typical steak and eggs dish  but when youre in Vegas  most places seem to hit the spot exactly the way it should   Love coming here while staying at the JW   Comfortable atmosphere  good coffee   Mollie  our waitress  awesome ,?
1723681,Heath and his son arrived at my house at the beginning of the two hour window he had given me   He accessed my honeycomb blinds and gave me a quote   He worked quickly and professionally   My blinds function like new!  Extremely pleased  I would highly recommend him!,?
1724036,Heathers Hair Salon is great for men too   Her prices are 1/2 the rate charged by other barbers and 1/3 the price charged by the dude on Bathurst just below Queen St (Corrados)   She is open on Saturdays at 9:00  AM instead of the late openings of others She is cheerful  and positive  and uplifting   And i got a great haircut!!Go to Heathers  at 780 Dundas St West  Its not closed ,?
1724653,Heed the warnings!!!  There is nothing redeeming about this dealership at any level   They treat you and the sales advisers like idiots; my sales adviser was told to shut up right in front of me   I could go on and on  I should have followed my better judgment after reading Dealer com  Google and Yelp   Dont make the mistake I did  go somewhere else   I had a great experience at Earnhardt Jeep 2016 Rubicon Hard Rock   They smoked Airparks tradein and cost of new Rubicon and treated me extremely professionally ,?
1724913,Heislers is a very underrated place to go  Most people look right past this place  and are unaware of its full deli  hot bar  and salad bar  The staff here are super friendly and quick to take care of you I give Heislers three stars based on the fact that  yes  they are a small market  but often times have food that appears to not be fresh and can be subpar  The hot bar food always tastes like leftovers and makes you feel as if you need to heat it up  Also  the food here at the buffet can be very pricey  All in all  I dont think Heislers is anything too special  but isnt a bad option for a quick and easy lunch ,?
1725109,Helen  at Veras is the best nail technician Ive seen  I even go to Vietnam and the service at Veras is 5 star  Ive been coming here for years and its always consistent & clean  The nail art that Helen does for me is top notch ,?

1726903,Hello  Hello  Had the Beef vindaloo and it was great  Perfect meal for a snowy day in Calgary  The menu has some nice choices and the quality to price ratio is good  This is a chain restaurant that offers good service but if you travel a lot is just kinda what you get in all other chain restaurants  not that that is a bad thing its just dont expect to be blown away for a culinary experience  It was in a nice new building just like all the other nice new buildings in that area  The service was very friendly  the meals came out fast and is exactly what I was wanted for my meeting ,?

1730022,Here is my current stop  stop #5 at Jones Libary at corner of Jones and Dundas I just stop here for a rest and to update my reviews from my earlier stops   Out of the two library i been to  Queen and Saulter look the most pleasing from the outside but I have to give functionally to Jones  we have about 8 computer  and 4 tables to work unfortunately no outlets so a long term stay isnt possible  that and the chairs are wooden    It has pretty decent collection for a small neighborhood branch  Pretty decent library but I wont use it too often ,?
1730101,Here is my story : i went to Mountain Dental 2 months ago mainly bcz they are down the street from me and in network  Great costumer service right from the start! You d think you walked into a SPA ! That being said  the good experience ended right there ! I had 4 fillings and a cleaning that costed me over $500 just out of pocket expense ! Keep in mind prior to my visit i had no dental issues or pain but since the last dentist visit was almost 2 years ago  i figured i needed some care  The fillings were extremely painful ! I am unable to drink  chew or bite into anything crunchy  cold or hot ! i went back after two weeks  to let Dr Yeanga know about the pain  After charging my insurance for another visit  i was told the pain is reversible and its due to close proximity of them to the nerve  Its been almost 2 months and im still in pain ! I regret going to them every time i eat or drink now ! Unbelievable !!!!!!,?
1730151,Here is one of those times where I just wonder what the heck Yelpers are thinking   This place is not bad but certainly not deserving to be rated higher than many of the other sushi joints in the area   First ill start with the fact that there is no sushi bar   This is a huge deal for me for many reasons primarily because you cannot see the fish and quality prior to ordering   The rolls were good but a few were mushy including the albacore on one of the rolls that was actually bad   Ive eaten albacore all my life and this was not right   The sauces were also very heavy on some of rolls making it impossible to taste the fish itself   Service was fast but with no personality or friendliness   Food came quick and well spaced out which is important with sushi   Good Asian beer list with an average sake list  Id have to say that considering the price ill be taking my biz to other joints nearby ,?
1730236,Here is the deal  Gave tapes in February to this guy (10 total) No return phone calls received  Went there in March still not ready  When I got them in April they were mislabelled  and they were not converted from beginning to end  Brought them back  waited and waited  had to go to the back room and check everyone  3 still not right  Left the state in May for 1 week  came backstill no word from them  phone disconnected and note on the door never addressed  Dont care if this guy is overwhelmed by the amount of work he got from groupon  Pay your damn bills  and do the work promised/paid for  respond to customers and return my damn tapes  Also hire another person if you are that overwhelmed   I will NEVER bring another thing to this so called business,?
1730914,Here to get my passport photos  No line  friendly service  good music  comfortable climate  Parking is street metered ,?
1731038,Here we are again waiting for hours to see the doctor  Been 2 hours past appointment and still waiting  Receptionist provides no updates and just leaves everybody waiting and cussing! They desperately need an office manager to organize their schedule ,?
1731987,Heres my ugly views from my patio for $1435 00 a month? Cars are always jacked up all over the sidewalks because most people use there garage for a storage unit not there cars  Its now my 11th month here and 2 of the 3 entrance and exit gates arent working  There response is  thats the way it is at all gated communities  Ridiculous and stupid is the only way to describe this place  I feel like they should pay me for all the crap Ive had to put up with  I donit know who this Tom G is  with this really good review  HE DOESNT EVEN LIVE HERE!!!!  Are you kidding me? Update  a week later the security gates still dont work???? Something I forgot to mention of the 14 windows in the apt  only 6 of them open  so its like a prison cell???,?
1732634,Heres the thing  I went on a Wednesday afternoon so I wont comment on service because it was fine However  I will comment on food  One of our party order an alfredo dish and it had clearly been reheated quickly (probably in a microwave)  How do we know this? Well  when reheated improperly/quickly  these dishes separate and oil was in puddles around concealed alfredo  VERY disappointing The clam chowder was meh  Briny and scant on clams  Truthfully  I can get the same thing out of a can of Campbells ,?
1732936,Heres what you do:GuacatonyMaybe a little Caesar salad action (big portion will feed 2)Alfredo the DarkChocolate Chip Pizza CookieDie ,?
1733329,Hesitant to give this place 5 stars because I love it so much that I want it all to myself haha    But seriously  such a gem! Went here for the first time a few weeks ago  and I love the atmosphere  It was the perfect amount of crowded that it was really fun  without having to wait 30 minutes at the bar for a drink  Definitely my new favorite place in Southside  Such a cool idea! Dont ever change!,?
1733772,Hey Michelle the hostess   As a hostess  it would be appropriate to address the person that gets to your hostess stand first  not the celebrity hairstylist from the hotel who is 20 ft behind me and who is probably going to get his meal compd anyway  I am sure my money spends just as well as his  You never know who you will be snubbing when you overlook people    like presidents of large pharmaceutical companies  Just sayin  If you are going to be in the service industry  then serve  regardless of the clientele  If you want to serve the hairstylist  maybe he needs a nanny     #fail,?
1733865,Hey Sugar was having their soft opening 20% off  They offer a selection of milk tea  milk series  yakult and fruit teas  I think the thing that stands out is the toppings that they offered: Golden tapioca  purple rice  taro balls  grass jelly and pudding (probably more)  We got the golden tapioca taro ball milk tea  The flavour is rich and bold  definitely does not taste watered down  The tapioca had the perfect chewyness and the taro ball was delightful to eat The environment was nice and instagrammable  They got marble counters and 3 hanging chairs and neon lights everywhere  Seems like this would be a great place to hang out ;),?
1734038,Hey betty I need a poodle skirt to go with my new bangs      or a pink mohair cardigan to match my beehive hairdo  Or     a twenties shiffon blouse to make my bonnie and clyde outfit for halloween  No problem found it here complete with its own glass buttons  The owner was helpful in showing me where I could try it on and offered to let me look at items in the cases  Cute little shop more womens clothing then mens  The owner was chatty with me or clerk whichever she was  There are two vintage stores in this area so you can check one then the other if you dont find what youre seeking on the first try   ,?

1734675,Hey this is the best place  The bald man has out did himself I ordered the burger can you say delicious!!! If you are in Vegas you have to stop by and get lunch dinner or a cookie or even a slice of chocolate pizza ,?
1734846,Hey! Fun times!I was in Vegas because     Vegas! Stumbled (literally) on the BB and Chris Robinson was playing  One Hamilton later Im upstairs in line for a beer and the band is sounding good  Magic Hat on tap? Yes please  plus a Stella Sound is good  lighting is better   Think House of Blues but with a bowling alley   Overall a great venue with entertainment most nights ,?
1735103,Hey  it is nowhere and does not look like much on the outside  sometimes not many people there but WHOOOOO a lot of folks are missing this excellent middle eastern food   I have tried it all  even the fish which could be to spicy for most but not me   The lamb is as good as you will ever get   I am a repeat customer  many times  very reasonableDan,?
1735221,Hey  the staff was okay but the service sucks badly we arrived at the resto around 7:2030 to take our orders it was long then we got our food around 8:20    Good place but the service sucks bad  I told one of my friends its probably because they are short of staff at least offer us a free entree wtv it was d*mn long I was starving or hire new personnel  2 star rating,?
1735346,Hey  This is the first place where i tried Oxtail dinner  and it was just so super!So close to what you get in jamaica  Jerk Chicken was also amazing like oxtail  Oxtail gravy had a sweet taste to it and jerk chicken had mild spices  Rice was made with beans and chicken stock  I would definitely go again  Food is expensive  Like the dinner combo costed 18 dollars ,?
1735560,Hi Christine P My health issue has been continued surgeries and they refused to let me out of the contract  since the DAY after I joined!!  I did as you suggested and emailed the address you sent me  but got no return   Now chasing the Vice President and President of the company to speak to about this issue!  To make it worse  I am stuck paying $34 a month for a gym that I cannot use (the only thing I can do is pool therapy and the pool is NEVER available) and memberships have dropped to $19 a month!!!!,?
1736109,Hi have had good luck with this company  They are not the cheapest but the people that work there care about the business and do a good job   You can tell by the showroom that the owner has pride in the business  I hope they keep this high level up   Bravo!,?
1736874,Hi;Food was decent; not blow me out of the water  Thought the experience of booking on yelp: then being told because we booked only a half hour prior we wouldnt be seated: (felt the entitlement of our head hostess can cool off) started the experience  Observing the wait staff buss their own tables (hop social culture); made the poor waiter; not be able to connect; have timely deliveries; and further socialize   Weird experience to a local bar dressed up ,?
1737211,Hidden Gem     I havent really noticed this place until my husband got me a mani/pedi gift card  Tried it out  absolutely loved it  Will never go back to the corner nail places      Thanks Chantel for your great and positive attitude/personality and information along the way with each product they use  Love the whole experience  Will be a customer for a long time,?
1739739,High quality ice cream  great flavors  and a Pittsburgh original  What more could you want? :),?
1739929,High recommend going here! My teeth are so awesomely white and no sensitivity  which I was definitely expecting some if not a lot  Boon did a great job in my treatment and is just an overall cool dude to spend a few hours with during the process  I recommend picking up some vitamin E oil for following few days after to put on several times a day to gums and mouth that the bleach may have touched (which is inevitable and not too bad  heals in a few days)  Overall very pleased with the entire experience and results and will be going back again when its time to!,?
1740576,Highly disappointed with my server   It seems that he forgot about my wife and I on several occasions   Brought me incorrect beer   Asked if I wanted an orange for my Blue Moon and I said yes   It is 3 days later and I still have not received my orange   This place has been good in the past but my trip this weekend was not ,?
1741717,Highly recommend the fajitas but if youre somewhat pressed on time be careful  I had one 45 minute delivery turn into 1 hour and 35 minutes  Besides the delivery mix ups they have once in a while the food is great at a great price ,?
1742391,Highly recommend using Annies for all your wheel and tire needs  They were able to repair my two left wheels after jumping a median   Took them no time at all they look good as new ,?
1742742,Highly recommend!!! Will be telling all my friends to come here! First time I have done an oil change for my 2014 Mustang and they took care of her well  I went last minute and thought I would be too late but Mark hooked it up because I drive a Mustang which is great lol considering all I hear from people are dont crash the car watch out for people lol nice to know a fellow brother also has a mustang! Will definitely be going here all the time even if it is a 40 min drive from home!,?
1742775,Highly recommend  this place is a gem!  We went out for a date night on a Saturday night   They were busy  but the service was impeccable   The waiter that served us was very knowledgeable and patient   He spoke with us about their wines and the best item to pair with our dinner choices   The wine was EXCELLENT!  I had a white and my boyfriend had a red  we both got a second glass (uncommon for us) because we liked it so much  We both loved our meal  I had the chicken and my boyfriend had the steak   My chicken had this amazing chili sauce that was outstanding ,?
1742957,Highly recommend  Used twice  (Initial house fell through  used Rob on our second house   This review applies to both inspections )He shows up on time (or early)  He was almost complete when we arrived at the inspection  He took the time to walk us through any issues he saw and pointed out key functions of the house   Does a very thorough job  While he did not physically inspect the roof  he has a drone that he uses to get pictures   He caught things that were missed by an FHA inspector  He caught workmanship issues on a new build  Very responsive  Supplies the inspection report within 24 hours (or well under)  Great demeanor  Readily answers questions and makes sure you understand the process ,?
1743473,Highly recommended  Pho is great  ingredients and soup r just perfect  Clean is place n Customer service is friendly ,?
1744287,Himal chuli is definitely one of my favorite places to eat in Madison  I have been frequenting this fine restaurant for the past 9 years and have never been disappointed  In fact I often crave their momochas  steamed vegetable dumplings flavored with peanut sauce and served in a tomatocoriander sauce (my favorite!)  The menu has many options for vegetarians and meat eaters  While I am a meat lover to the bone  I prefer their vegetarian entrees  I am also a huge fan of their whole wheat roti  The family who runs the restaurant is very friendly and provides excellent service  Whether you are a long time resident of Madison or just passing through  I highly recommend this restaurant if you are looking for a fresh meal with distinctive ethnic flavor and a warm atmosphere  ,?
1744455,Hip new restaurant in SW Las Vegas   Tasteful seafood dishes & sushi   My favorite is the seafood bouillabaisse   Service is also very good ,?
1744476,Hip semiupdated diner in a gettingtobe hip neighborhood   I got a shake and grilled cheese and both were pretty tasty  but probably double in price what they would have been had this been a regular diner   Nonetheless  the atmosphere is pretty cool  the food was pretty good  and its nice to have variety like this in Toronto!,?
1744911,Hired Encore Sounds to provide a photo booth for a family reunion on June 25   Encore Sounds was a no show  despite assurances a few days before the event that they would be there   Encore Sounds has not replied to voice and email messages since the event and has not issued a refund   BEWARE!!!  I do not recommend ,?
1744987,Hired Vegas Limo Coach for my wedding  They were able to accommodate our specific needs and the drivers were friendly  helpful  and punctual   We used the purple rain 20 seater   Got the champagne  and used them for three pickups that day  Drivers John and Michael were great ,?
1746728,Hmm  I thought this place was AOK  I was surprise to learn its Emerils restaurant  I mean  I have to say I have tasted better steaks  I got the ribeye not knowing that it was huge and was really surprise when I saw it  I should have shared and thought the portion was great for 50 bucks  I ordered medium well  but it was redder than normal  I thought it was over seasoned  The potatoes were really good though  The service was okaywe had a big party and they accommodated us  but I felt that since we were a younger crowd than normal  they didnt give the best service they could  The server didnt really smile and forgot one of our checks and so we had to wait for a while to get it backs  The people in my party that didnt get steak enjoyed their dishes  If I go next time  I wouldnt order steak but yet this is a steakhouse  ,?
1748278,Hmmmmmm how should I rate this restaurant   If there is a minus zero I would have rate it  This place is so horrible   What a disgrace to vietnamese  PHO is one of the  best in vietnamese food  how could you cook it so bland  No taste  it literally taste like just water  The Waiting is so long  Service sucks  Ordered to go and it has yet to be done  Its been 25 going on 30 minures  Wth!  Not even vietnamese running the place  Holy cow!!  Therefore do not go here to eat  No bueno hahahaha ,?
1748480,Hob Nob I am so happy to have you in my life :}This is the place to be for GREAT food and GREAT football! Da Bears have the ultimate den here!But not ONLY do they have the Chicago passion for football  but they also stay true to Chicagos passion of food! The chips and salsa had great flavor  the chips werent some paper thin rice cake they had substance! and the salsa had just enough spice to keep you coming back for more! They claim their gyros are the best and I have to AGREE 100% tender meat  full of FLAVOR (not salt) and the pita never got soggy  MmmMMmSome of my highlights from tonight: GREAT food Da Bears fight song whenever we scored Da Bears shuffle and other Beartribute songs during halftime All the Chicago fans The owner coming out and giving highfives to all the Bears fans even when things were looking bleak  :}Thank you Hob Nob  I will be back!,?
1749284,Hole in the wall  Dont get fooled by the look  its legit Indian food  packed like a burrito  The ingredients are fresh  even the potatoes! Had the lamb tikka masala roti  really loved it  The authentic spice with fresh lamb was incredible  Large portion  the box is pretty heavy  Canned soda for a dollar  No washroom  so make sure you go to the Tim Horton around the corner before hand ,?
1749331,Holeinthewall Mexican couldnt get any better  The nachos are fabuloso (the small is more than any one person can handle) and the green corn tamales are out of this world! Salsa is great  service is great (at least the times I have been there) I highly recommend!,?
1750207,Holy Crap! $5 steak entrees and $1 microbrews are served up here year round!!!For that price in a town like Vegas  there is very little I can really complain about  The steak was decent (meaning I wasnt running to the bathroom soon after) and the beers are easy drinking  Here is where youll bump into the locals and thrifty travelers  Upon entering  please dont mind the smoke and smalltown atmosphere   its all part of this places charm ,?
1751257,Holy cow this place is as amazing as everyone has already stated! Yelp suggested it to us as a new and hot restaurant and we are big dumpling fans so we were ready to be impressed and we were  The best potstickers either of us have ever had anywhere in the US including overseas! We ordered 6 potstickers 12 dumplings and the barbecue pork fried rice  we were so excited we had our first dumpling out of the bag almost burning our mouths and it was so worth it  Next time we are ordering the scallion pancake  meat pie and the soups! Thanks so much!,?
1751829,Holy crap is this place gorgeous! I never really understood what the beauty of nature meant until seeing a place like this  It was breathtaking  Huge  glorious mountains and rocky terrain cover miles and miles of land  It is exactly what you would expect the desert to look like and it does not disappoint  We were part of a tour and were not able to take part in any of the adventure seeking activities that they offered but it was still just amazing to walk around the land and take it all in  So no matter how you do or what you do at Red Rock Canyon  just make sure you do Red Rock Canyon!,?
1752145,Holy crap  I and my date got the tasting menu here   It was so much delicious food and wine that we could barely walk away after we were done   Stuffed to the brim  let the chef guide you through this one the first time you go ,?
1752169,Holy crap  holy crap  holy crap!!!! I had no idea what I was getting into when I bought the tickets  It sounded more interesting than any other show in Vegas and more entertaining and it was!  No matter where your seats are you feel as if youre in the middle if the action  If your in the front row be careful  you will get picked on and if you get out if your seat youre in danger of being hit by the action  I dont think Ive laughed so hard in a long time  It helps that Im a fan of dirty humor  I would advise that if youre sensitive or have no sense of humor then save your money and see a family friendly show ,?
1752832,Holy hell!!! Loved this place!!!!! It was my first time here  but Ive been to a few dueling piano bars and this one definitely holds up  The awesome part besides all the crazy singing  dancing  and serenading was it wasnt just pianos! One guy got on too of the pianos and truly rocked out on his guitar! He was so amazing and hilarious!! I had such a blast here! They even brought tears at one point when they brought a couple up for their 20 year anniversary and had them dance to what a wonderful world  It was so romantic and sweet  The reason for 4 stars not 5 is the insane prices!!!! They can afford to lower the drinks $2  but I guess thats what you get in Vegas!,?
1753211,Holy moly! This is the best! They are not only the best Mexican bakery but the best all around  We tried several things recommended by my mother in law which is btw   hard to get  shes picky! Super impressive on price and flavor  Everything we had was wonderful and balanced  I hope theyre open for Mothers Day! After treating her to a homemade brunch Id love to take her for an incredible dessert!,?
1753934,Holy smokes what a welcome! Thanks to Mariana for getting our visit started off right  She opened the door for us and began to ask us the usual questions how are you doing tonight? And have you dined with us before?  When I said we havent been there before  she quickly became interested and gave us some great recommendations as well as explaining that its a build your own pizza type place  When Joanna (our waitress) took over  we were ready to order since Mariana familiarized us so well  We decided on a traditional antipasto that had the best mozzarella and delicious peppers  Then went for the small (which is huge) pesto pizza  that comes with the mozzarella  We then decided to add artichokes  mushrooms  pepperoni  and half traditional sauce since my friend doesnt like pesto  The pizza was made quickly in a cool coal oven and had an overload of garlic (just the way I like it)  It truly was absolutely delicious and everyone was so pleasant  Thank you for treating us well!,?
1753963,Holy smokes! First time here  was picked up by the shuttle driver at the airport  Nicest guy! Gave me great recommendations for nearby southern comfort places that did NOT disappoint  I was greeted by a tall Lady (didnt get her name but was super nice!) with a warm cookie  Room was HUGE and super clean  But hands down    their breakfast  I travel constantly (domestic and internationally) and literally the most selection/ fresh food and fruits I have ever seen!! Holy smokes I wish I had more time to stay and enjoy lol Ill definitely be back! Thanks guys  keep up the great workz,?
1755505,Honda reliability and great resale value!  Thats the pitch anyway until it is time to buy a new car and trade in a Honda car  Warning the dealership will offer you a third of your cars value to start  I know they are trying to make money but that is insulting to a Honda owner   The excuse is they need to buy at wholesale value to fix up to retail value ,?
1755812,Honest fresh wholesome food  Nice relaxing setting and atmosphere  friendly service ,?
1755979,Honest sandwiches with fresh ingredients  The duck sandwich with spring salad was fantastic  There is a lovely patio and plenty of indoor seating as well  The price is a bit high for a sandwich though ,?
1757600,Honestly highly recommend this place! So clean and wonderful attention to detail! Love the hot towel they put over the feet and the hot stone massage that comes with every pedicure  Im so picky about my nails  This place is really up to the mark ,?
1757785,Honestly its hard for me to love another place when I have been a loyal customer of Yamma sushi  However  the menu and the flavors of this restaurant are pretty similar  Most of my favorite items were the same as Yamma sushi  The service was probably much better as they were not as packed and we received our food so much faster! My favorite dishes were no name  dragon ball and channel  The all you can eat prices are very reasonable and very competitive  I think this is a good spot to go and try some different options but pretty average place!,?
1759119,Honestly this hotel is by far and away the best  The hotel staff are amazing  view from the rooftop bar is a plus  close to everything you need  and rooms were very well maintained ,?
1760767,Honestly  Overhyped The service was nice and the atmosphere was was pretty good but thats about it  (3/5)Tried the Lobster Ramen(1/5) and Shio Clam Ramen(3/5)  The lobster tasted like a lobster bisque and the peppers they added did not work well with ramen at all  Tasted like spaghetti with soaked in lobster bisque basically  The portion was also super small  pretty much finished it in two slurps  The Shio Clam Ramen was a little better  For starters  the portion was atleast 23 times bigger than the Lobster Ramen  The soup is a clear clam soup base  The truffle is the most expensive part of the ramen but I honestly think it doesnt add anything to the ramen or broth flavor  But what can you expect from a 14 dollar ramen that includes black truffle  Good to try once but I probably wont be back ,?
1761966,Honestly  this place is a disaster  The food quality is horrific  and they have increased the prices  Its like a bad joke that keeps getting worse  Service was okay  but it should be in an empty restaurant  If you disrespect your clientele this much  the only option is to shut it down and reopen something else  When you raise the price of a dish by 8 dollars  and then use seafood that wouldnt be fit for a garbage buffet  it is beyond repair  We get it! You dont give a,?
1762019,Honestly  this place is the best Cuban food in the area considering there is no other options  Unfortunately I just sat there for over half an hour waiting for my meal       To find out that it never got placed and now their closing in 10 minutes  So in the end I had to watch my friend eat his meal while waiting for my dinner that never came  Horrible customer service ,?
1762034,Honestly  this place made my freshman years  Despite its appearance  Paisanos is one of the best Mexican food places around  Theyve got a great selection at affordable prices  and have some of the nicest people servicing you  If youre new to Tempe  you have to try this place,?
1762047,Honestly  this place sucks  Ive been to the JOEYS in downtown and it cant compared  The dishes were lukewarm and the tacos were drenched in salt  We had to drink two cups of water just from that dish! My friend got so sick after eating their pasta  She spent all night in the washroom!  Luckily  I had only had a little bit of the pasta since it lacked flavor  I felt like the pasta was steamed in oil and the tomatoes and arugula were just decorations  There were hardly any pieces of chicken   And they called it Chicken Tatalligate The kitchen needs to improve on their plating speed too  I watched the guy let our food just sit there  It certainly wasnt worth the price I paid for  We were better off at a hk style cafe or even PICKLE BARREL  I was extremely disappointed  I guess if I ever decide to go to Joeys again  it will be the one near EATONS ,?
1762812,Honeycomb is awesome! Love the natural products and the great service! Especially love my stylist Lindsay!! She did amazing work on my hair and used the best approach to dying through store brand colors that I had ruined my hair with! I left with the exact style and color I wanted!

1764050,Horatio is a master pizza maker   Wonderful  quaint spot with great beer and beautiful  Naples style pizza   We recommend highly ,?
1765055,Horrible Service! Weve been waiting the chef so long and also the chef wont start cook if the table isnt full  Never coming back here anymore!,?
1765656,Horrible checking in system  the worst  Waited for almost an hour & the lady in front told us our name is not even on list  Thats just the wait time to stay in another line to pay  The lady at the front was rude & disrespectful   As if shes doing us a favor to talk to us   Left hungry & totally upset Will never go back    Not going to pay top $$$ to be treated with disrespect,?
1765852,Horrible company  they never return a single phone call  you have to email them for everything and hope they acknowledge it  They hire guys that barely can do there trade probably laborers from homedepot parking lot  The warranty a home builder gives you is useless because these guys cant get the repair right,?
1766172,Horrible customer service and experience entirely  Went into the store ready to buy a couch and left knowing I will never shop or recommend this store to anyone  RC Willey had wonderful employees and I never felt disrespected like I did at Walker ,?
1766204,Horrible customer service and management! Ordered take out and when I got home I didnt get all my order  When I called and told them they said they couldnt do anything for me unless I had a receipt! I NEVER GOT MY RECEIPT WHEN I PAID!! Shame on you Wok Box! Never again!!,?
1766235,Horrible customer service and scheduling issues  I was almost taken advantage of but thanks to Groupon my money  was returned   I would never recommend this place of business ,?
1767083,Horrible customer service  I called multiple time to get a status update on my engine  I get a call back from them a month later  I order my engine early August they told me it would be done in October  October comes around they tell me November  November is done now they say December  I get a call from them at the end of December saying my engine will be done by mid January  Its January 20th while I write this and still no engine  I called them multiple times trying to get a hold of the guy who gives you an ETA on when it should be ready  but he hasnt responded yet  I spent a lot of money on my engine and Phoenix Engine has given me nothing in return ,?
1767093,Horrible customer service  I thought maybe it was just a bad day when I moved on this side of town and wanted a blizzard  however 4 visits later and unfortunately its just poor customer service as well as having other flavors in my blizzard leading me to believe they arent cleaning their blenders between orders  so gross  wont be going back  have to find a new place for my sweet tooth nearby  I hope the owner cleans house but based on reviews Ive read and theres still a problem I highly doubt it  to bad  could be a great location if wasnt being run by a bunch of misfits  Adding to post  husband wont stay away due to lack of options  heres his Oreo blizzard wheres the Oreos,?
1767291,Horrible customer service  we waited long to order our food  food didnt take long to arrive  but there was no assigned waiter and we werent ever checked up on  I ended up ordering dessert and it never arrived so we had to get up to ask for our checks and it took long in general   I had been wanting to try this place out for years and my first time was a horrible experience ,?
1767450,Horrible customer service   Pay the extra money and get a direct ride using Uber or a taxi   The employees dont know whats going on  they contradict each other with information  they told us the wrong place to go to wait for pickup so we almost missed our ride  and they were late picking us up   All stress I dont need while trying to get to the airport on time    The value you get is not worth even the low price ,?
1767681,Horrible customer service  Front desk did not care that items were missing from room  Only housekeeping was in the room that Im aware of  First trip to the front desk no one was there so we came back in the morning  Front desk said it wasnt their problem to contact security  Security said my son probably stole the item because he was the first one in the room  This was after he accused us of lying because we didnt report it the evening before  I get it my nephew should have put his things up  The thief really is not my main issue  The staff didnt take us serious and basically blew us off  So apparently they dont care if their employees steal or treat patrons like crap  The could have at least pretended to make a report   They basically told us to F off!,?
1767784,Horrible customer service  I have a 4 year old Lennox AC that stopped cooling  The first time they came out they refilled the coolant but didnt check anything  It stopped cooling again 10 days later   I called them again  It takes hours sometimes days for anyone to call you back   They have an answering service which answers most of their calls  you rarely speak to someone in the office  They came out a 2nd time refilled the coolant  but couldnt check the AC because it was raining  They came out a third time and figured out it was the coils on the unit  Its been 10 days and the coils have been ordered but are not in   My AC once again for the third time stopped cooling   I called them at 9am to come out and put coolant in and they didnt get back to me until 430 and said they would call tomorrow  Unacceptable     three times without AC on a 4 year old unit during 8090 degree weather    unacceptable,?
1767814,Horrible customer service  I rang the bell and a guy came out  and I said I would love to look around    he said look around ? Not if your not going to buy  I replied well I dont know if Im going to buy without knowing what you have  He pointed to the door and had a bad attitude  I hope hes not the owner  he might as well put a closed sign up! And if he just works there hes losing money to whoever owns the shop! Just terrible ,?
1767832,Horrible customer service  I understand that there is a wait with a 9 person party  but no communication for over 30 minutes and 2 large tables by the door (could fit 12 people each) were vacant  Was asked twice by 2 different people about party size  Other parties who came after us were seated with little wait time  When went to inquire about estimated wait time  was told rudely you have a party of 9  You have to wait  I only have 4 large tables available  When we went to leave  only then were we offered one of the large tables by the door  Im sure the food is delicious but not when you treat customers in that manner  Very disappointed in the lack of professionalism ,?
1768099,Horrible customer service  Stood at the counter for 5 minutes 3 feet from someone who worked there and she completely ignored me while working on her I pad  Finally asked if I was being helped and what I needed  told her no I hadnt been  and while she was looking up my order a lady walked in and she immediately asked how she could help her  What a joke ,?
1768369,Horrible customer service  WiFi kept kicking me off  Italian soda I ordered was overpowered with syrup and the was zero carbonation  Flat and disgusting  Worst coffee shop Ive been to in a long time,?
1768799,Horrible experience AGAIN!! Used to get my hair done by Duc who moved back to SC  Since then havent been able to find a hair dresser that can cut straight hair in a V properly  Teresa screwed my hair up  tugging half the hair off my head when she should be combing it out after a wash  She cuts like she wants to cut me!Travis is nice  but thats about it  Anyone know where Duc is? He was suppose move back to vegas in February  His phone has now been disconnected He worked and was trained by Toni and Guy  He is the only hairdresser I ever found that was GREAT at what he does ,?
1770112,Horrible experience  Customer service was ok  Food was decent  Dont order the bacon burger  It taste like a Big Mac   Everything takes so long to arrive at your table  It might not be the waiters or cooks   It might be that management has one person waiting on 10 or more tables  They are good to sit you down tho  No waiting time with 5 hostess doing nothing but joking around  Its ok  We all should be happy at work  So no biggie but dont go there hungry you will stay hungry for a while   Good luck !,?
1770400,Horrible experience  The enestitician applied steam for less than 2 minutes and plowed an extraction tool into my face leaving a scabbing sore on 2 areas of my face  She never fully cleaned off my make up as I had mascara flakes around my eyes when finished  She seemed more interested in selling me products after the procedure  It was awful    I do not recommend at all  Save your $$$$    No star   Only had to apply one to post this,?
1770433,Horrible experience  The worst customer service ever  Would not stay at another Hilton as long as live ,?
1770768,Horrible food and horrible service  Chicken and fries were like these had been under the heat lamp for hours  Chicken was dry and fries stale  Server dropped off the food and did not come back until it was time for us to pay the bill  Regret posting a bad review ,?
1771010,Horrible food  horrible service  Im really not sure how this place manages to stay in business ,?
1771679,Horrible horrible horrible  The leasing office is NEVER helpful  They charge additional fees without explanation and they NEVER answer the phone in their office  The one time I actually made time out of my busy life to go to the front office I got attitude!

1772914,Horrible place! Go any where else but here! They lie! Horrible customer service  I was talked down to  they were rude  no customer service what so ever!

1773808,Horrible service and food  Staff was very rude    Food was so so  But not worth the poor seevice,?
1774055,Horrible service at the bar     I sat for 15 minutes with an empty beer    my food order was wrong and took 30 minutes for a lunch meal    then as I left I politely told the manager about my experience and she said we hardly ever have anyone say they had a bad experience    are you sure that everything wasnt ok      she then acted as if they dont need my business because they have been here 60 years      not taking care of people is how we lose our old Mom and pop restaurants I guarantee the people that opened this restaurant would be disgusted!!!!,?
1774093,Horrible service bad customer lines refused to help the customer they penalize on the trying to fix the problem Im done with any banking business with this bank,?
1774145,Horrible service department  never go there! They sell you a car and then treat you like crap when you come in for servicealways over booked  and never deliver Took in because our brand new diesel had transmission problems got it back and it immediately (within a week) had fuel gauge problems (fuel gage constantly said low even though full) dealership then tried to say it was not related  this car has 36 500 miles on it  now magically the fuel gauge is not under warranty and costs $1100 to fix   very shady business,?
1774401,Horrible service my first time ever going to an Arbys I was so disappointed they took for ever to get our order and they didnt even know what we ordered we had to tell them again they dont communicate with each other  Both girls were rude  They didnt know the menu  Will never have this again EVER!!,?
1774891,Horrible service! I was the only one in the drivethrough line and it took 20 minutes to make a smoothie  Why would it take so long there is no one else in line??? I would not even give this a one star but that was the only option    if it was up to me it would be zero*,?
1775764,Horrible service  rude staff  good food though  The tables and the floor were sticky and dirty  the staff dont even talk to you unless they are telling you the ripoff prices  Nobody told us that it was all you can eat  Horrible ,?
1775863,Horrible service  they sadly do not care  I have made severalPhone calls and several emails  I have to contact the police instead since Gen and Richard choose to ignore us all as Windgate residents  We had a man arrested on our street at 10:00pm he drops off people in our community to have them know on our doors and attempt to break in if no one is home Our security personal is not qualified to do the job they fall asleep at the gate or in their vehicles at the  Lets gate  We have asked to meet with Gen and Richard and Richard meg jets to return my phone calls or emails  We pay 285 00 a month for NO security  Hen claims the problem is fixed mybolacing a guard in there vehicle and all that they do is sleep in the car our stand in the dark as the gates are wide open and anyone drives into our community! This is sadly a joke to them,?
1775881,Horrible service  trashy enviornment  even trashier staff     all around FAIL,?
1775992,Horrible serviceparty of 102 5 hours and one drink after 25 min  No other drinks offered?  Hello?  Slow and unattentive  Not really sure who our waiter was and since we had 10  tip was included  Would have gotten 5%  Good was a B ,?
1776201,Horrible service   They simply do not care at all   I ordered a recliner and was told it would take 23 weeks to deliver   After 4 I called the store to see what was happening   I was told the material I selected had some sort of issue at the mill and they no longer had any expected delivery date   Nobody contacted me about this   I then asked what were they going to do about this   I was told I could come back in and select a new material  wait another 23 weeks and hopefully this time it would be available   All they did was try to pass the buck  this person should have contacted you  its not our fault it was the mill  etc   There was no attempt at all on their end to make it right  they simply do not care   I demanded a refund and was given one   I would highly recommend going elsewhere  customers are not important to them   I went to Lazboy (who is known for being on the high side price wise) and found a better quality chair at a better price (including the shipping) ,?
1776216,Horrible service   Truly a massive disappointment   I cant recommend this under circumstance   DO NOT GO HERE  Horrible service ,?
1776486,Horrible service  Forgot our orders twice  Waited an hour for food  Found 2 pieces of hair in our noodle dishes  Some food didnt seem fresh ,?

1777544,Horrible service    Ordered a drink that did not taste correct  sent it back and was still charge for the full price of the drink   I was told there was nothing wrong on there and and I was still liable for the drink even though they dumped it in the sink   I will never be back at this establishment and I wish them luck   ,?
1777637,Horrible service; food is marginal   Went on a Sunday for lunch with 6 friends and our waitstaff didnt inform us of specials  didnt want to answer menu questions  and knew nothing about the gluten free menu   She brought us a wrong order and acted offended when it was returned   We wont be back   Save your $ and find a better restaurant with decent service ,?
1778097,Horrible unfair company  more to come   ,?
1778531,Horrible! Customer service was crap  they repeatedly messed up my order and then to top it off when I finally ate it  it tasted like rancid oil  Threw it all away  save your money and go somewhere else ,?
1778579,Horrible! First time using them! These people must be on crack! First they said my clothes were not ready and to come back in an hour  I come back an hour later and they said they dont have anything and it must have been taken to another location  Then they find it and leave it outside!,?
1778649,Horrible! Horrible! customer service  would not return calls  My doctor sent me to them for a CPAP Machine   When I wanted to get my supplies they never returned my calls   So I asked my doctor to intervene and the sales rep called me   11/27/2017 she said she would take care of it and nothing  So I called again 11/30/2017 she said she would take care of it and nothing  12/6/2017 she said she would take care of it and nothing  12/12/2017 she said she would take care of it and nothing  They started pointing fingers at the doctor and then doctor said they sent it   If I where a doctors office I would never do business  with them  I still dont have anything I have to call my insurance company now to see what can be done ,?
1778989,Horrible! They made a mistake on our reservation and we now are stuck with out an RV for our spring break trip! Dont count on them if your trip is important!,?
1780048,Horrible  nasty dry frys an chicken strips that look like chicken nuggets an were extremely dry   Im very disappointed,?
1780629,Horrible  Delayed two days because the plane did not have wheels  They lost all three of mine and my partners bags  have been complete jerks over the phone and in person  totally unapologetic  Delivered the bags days after they promised and they were the wrong bags  I am still waiting for my stuff  I fly internationally frequently for work and this is by far the worst airline I have ever dealt with  That includes local airlines in Afghanistan  Bolivia  and Cambodia ,?
1781636,Horrible     sticky floors     greasy dirty monitors   only one person to wait the front and drive thru and cook    the other person walked out while person 1 was on break leaving her alone     ordered burger meals for 4 of us (nothing fancy) and the total was $50    I said you must be kidding        nope    walked out!!!,?
1782807,Hostess was extremely rude; she just walked off without saying anything after we told her the number in our party  Most people would be like please follow me Ordered drinks  pear martini (fairly good) & strawberry limeade (limeade was terrible  had an awful aftertaste & it had an identity crisis  didnt know if it was going to be sweet or sour   )Ordered 2 fried rice dishes  which ended up being extremely salty  Would not recommend   Only good thing about the whole experience was that our waiter  Doug was really nice ,?
1782999,Hosts are impressively neat and personable  Food is excellent!! Environment VERY clean and neat  Highly recommended  Looking forward to my next visit  Thanks Egg N Joe ,?
1783909,Hot n ready pizza is never hot and ready every time I come here on any day is a 1025min wait on a single pizza worst spot to have,?
1785646,Hours: 7ammidnightAlcohol: noneWiFi: yes  ask for passwordFood: poutine is very goodType: simple  local restaurant,?
1786475,How anyone can give this resturant a good rating is  beyond me  I have eatten all over the world both high end end and more casual and this one doesnt fall into either category  The service is below average The prices are outrageous for the amount of food and quality  I dont mind paying top dollar   but when I do I expect good food  The food has no flavor  thr presentation is nothing to speak of  The service is terrible So disappointed!The force you to order more to scam you and get more money We left there starving and so unhappy We had an app for 26 dollars it was literally four mini ravioli that my 13 year old daughter can make and   better Dont waste your time or money We had pizza after and that was better !!They should be ashamed of themselves charging 25 dollars for a bib salad thats a fork full Stay away!!,?
1786542,How are they still in business? I would give 0 stars if possible  AVOID AT ALL COST     absolute worst customer service and super unprofessional  This is my first yelp review but I hadddd to :(,?
1787084,How can someone rate this place with anything other than 1 star unless they are rating the atmosphere rather than their food  or they dont know how to cook  or rather have not ate at a better Chinese restaurant  Their food is soggy  vegetables over cooked  their sauce has no taste  chicken taste like dumplings  Terrible  Better go and buy from carry out and pay 60% less for your food than eating from this place ,?
1787233,How can you beat a bar by an awesome pool that makes you feel like you are on vacation?The food is average for pool food and the drinks are what you ask them to create   However   my biggest hang up here is the customer service  I have a keen sense and I could feel the tension  drama and chaos between the bartenders and even the servers   They even complained about another bartender who they thought was faking an illness just to go home earlier  No one behind the bar made eye contact with the customers and I was there a good three hours people watching with my girlfriend   Notenot all pool customers are creepers who want to get your digits and hang out with you later!! We were appalled by the immaturity  Given that my Hubs and I have a season pool pass  we will come back  I only hope it gets better  not worse ,?
1787235,How can you beat a double double animal style for $3 50??? McWho? Great service at the drive through  We need these in Washington ,?
1788317,How dare people give this place three stars  Great wings  beer and sports all day everyday  Sometimes the workers can be slow and have their off days but who cares  Just get me my wings and put the game on  Recommend asian zing  garlic Parmesan  and lemon pepper  I always order a large chili cheese fries to go with my wings  Go Texans ,?
1788374,How did I forget this?This place just rocks all the way around  Even with their overpriced drinks and retarded wait times  Just go Get the Guac and the Porkbelly Oscar the Grouch used to be orange  Jim Henson decided to make him green before the second season of Sesame Street  Did you know that? No  You didnt  This has officially been the most helpful review you have ever read  Youre welcome ,?
1789010,How do they do it?  Huge dining areas  bustling servers  massive quantities of food and it all comes together   Menu is simple:  fried  deep fried or broiled There are even nonseafood items to satisfy nothing from the ocean eaters  like my wife   Everyone can find something to eat at Steves Try to come early on peak eating times  like Friday and Saturday nights   Other nights are not a mob scene   That said  they do get people seated pretty quick And if you have people from outside the South  this is a place to show them a uniquely southern experience   We have taken newcomers  Germans and visitors and everyone enjoys it ,?
1789732,How does this not have 5 stars?! This is my favorite spot  Its very rare to find this type of cafe in Las Vegas  trust me Im a native  Their chicken sandwich is amazing  I also love their deli burger  Everything is so fresh and so full of flavor  I hope it lasts in this shopping center  it seems like not many places stay here  which makes me wonder what greedy person owns this business plaza  Side note rant done! Thank you Jacques for bringing your awesomeness here!!,?
1789792,How does this place have no reviews? Next time you think about going to Giant Eagle for your next grilloff  punch yourself and then come here  Actually  just come here even if you arent going to grill   they have other stuff for you  I could write a book  but the short version is that this place is awesome  the people running it are awesome  and it makes me sad that the next generation to come probably wont have a place like this to visit (they will have   Giant Eagle)  Be brave  be bold  be awesome  Come here ,?
1790589,How have I not reviewed this place yet even though Ive been here like 7 times?! This is some of the best food in the valley and if you havent been here yet you are MISSING  OUT  I have some food sensitivities so I havent had any of the sauces and just get plain chicken  but its SO PERFECTLY cooked and delicious  and doesnt take a long time to get once you order  Plus the donut options are plentiful and always great  The one with the passion fruit glaze is the winner for me  but Ive liked everything Ive had  But seriously  if they have passion fruit when you go  you gotta try it Also every time Im here the staff is just so friendly and personable  It makes me enjoy going here all the more  Looking forward to my next visit!,?
1790819,How in the world did this place get its rating???  OK for those who were fooled like we were  they do not serve actual pieces of chicken!   They pound their white meat chicken into what they call chicken tenders (aka a big fat piece of chicken filet pattie) and they make it look like pieces of actual fried chicken This place sucked!,?
1792052,How tacos should taste! Fresh ingredients including  cojita cheese  cilantro  and lime  Good bang for your buck for only $3 00! Very filling!,?
1792259,How this place has 4 stars at the time of this review is beyond me  Got three simple dishes on Friday you know for a Friday night in  chicken fried rice  well that was not even close to being fried golden chicken no white like it was boiled! Add to there being 6 strips of chicken in that and the rice was stodgy! Schezuen beef yep no more than 7 pieces of meat awful and the general tsos my god I dont know what the point was just should have been batter with flavor  Really poor my advice drive up the road to what was Shia bistro now rainbow never had anything bad there and the people are friendly too  Sorry but avoid this place,?
1792966,Hubbie always wanted to see a dueling pianos show  but really in his mind  the show would play out as it did on Legend of 1900  where two musicians duke it out to oneup the other in piano talent  Well  that isnt the typical  and it turned out to be fine  We were initially disappointed to find that we didnt know any of the songs that were being requested  but eventually we just appreciated the sheer talent of the pianists  How they could seemingly telepathically sync up and improvise with no errors is beyond us  And they were even able to do justice to heavy metal songs where of course pianos are not in the original song  As others noted  drinks are pricey  Entertainment is great though ,?
1793140,Hubby and I been longing for malasadas since we visited Leonards in Honolulu in 2015 and glad to find out that island sushi sells malasadas! We made it a point to check this place out while in Vegas  Called and placed the order in and picked 1/2 dozen up in 20 minutes  We couldnt wait and ate them right outside of the restaurant  They were hot and fluffy   May not be as original as leonards but they were very very good!!! Definitely will visit again when in Vegas again!!!!,?
1794784,Huey at Wild Rose Cleaners is what every small business owner should strive to be to their customers  Hes very personable  passionate about what he does and the service he provides Ive been taking things to Huey for years  and will continue to do so! Great local business!,?
1795060,Huge breakfast  really creamy  tasty waffle & pancakes! We could have fed another person with all the food served  we will be back!,?
1795084,Huge burger fan here so love the option here for basically any kind of burger/wrap you chose  I unfortunately didnt 100% love the turkey burger I chose  but fortunately  plenty of other choices to allow for next time  We also did try the fish tacos  which were very good  especially the pineapple salsa  The sweet tater tots are among some of the best Ive tried in Charlotte  I love how they flavored them with honey and cinnamon sugar  so they are a bit sweeter  Im not a whiskey person  so I cant speak to the whiskey here  but i think it can be a great sell! There is a $2 upcharge if you want to change the stated burger on the menu to a beef/veggie burger  which is something to keep in mind  Prices are reasonable  about $12$14/burger  Service was good  I would certainly eat here again  and if you want creative burgers with fancy toppings like sriracha grilled prosciutto  apple  bourbon bbq sauce  or praline smoked bacon  this is your spot!,?
1795825,Huge inside with tons of seating which rocks    Big  cool patio but why not add some live music  or a dj out there??    Bartendars are not friendly or helpful  Been here 1/2 dozen times and all they say is what do you want to drink?   Would love a friendly staff it would make me want to come here more often,?
1796108,Huge park! Welllit and wellused after dark   Beautifully maintained   A few large ramadas spaced out through the park  I love that walking paths weave throughout the park as well as circle the perimeter; you can go for a long walk and get a little bit of a change of scenery by switching paths   My daughter has fun feeding the ducks in the large pond   Minus one star just because the play area is small and doesnt have much to it ,?
1796140,Huge place and they have one at a time restroom stalls   Why?  If you have a busy bladder plan to wait 10 minutes just for some relief   Came here alone and waited 45 minutes for a sandwich which was subpar  3 stars is generous ,?
1796192,Huge place    good selection of crafting materials   I usually come here for paint supplies and photo frames   It seems like theyve got about anything you need for craft projects   Even their seasonal stuff changes a lot   At one point I think I saw some small furniture items in here as well I am a little tainted since this used to be a grocery store I used to work at when I was in high school   Brings back good memories  but it makes it strange to visit since it wasnt what it used to be   Its good that Hobby Lobby chose this location though since the space sat empty for a year or two  I think that was even more depressing to look at since it is the largest retail space in Matthews Corners Im usually and inandout shopper but I can definitely see people getting lost in the vast store of all things hobby related ,?
1796253,Huge portion  delish made to order pizza  Perfect crust and salad was fresh  The romain was a bit wilted in the heat  but not their fault  it a billion degrees in Vegas!,?
1796462,Huge portions of smoked meat  If youre in this part of town  need to eat in a hurry  and wanted a taste of what the famed smoked meat was about  then Reubens Deli isnt a bad choice The vinegarbased cole slaw is excellent and sorely needed to cut all the grease and fat in the smoked meat sandwich  Get one sandwich and split it with a friend ,?
1796691,Huge portions  yummy food  great recommendations from out server  Travis  We arrived around 3pm on a Friday and had no wait  but returned on Saturday and it was PACKED! Would definitely go back during the week between meal times to avoid the wait again  It deserves all the hype!,?
1797413,Huge store  Clean  Its a shame they cant keep their shelves stocked  They also have a very limited selection  I never find everything on my list when I go here  Just a waste of time ,?
1797496,Huge theatre  great sound  comfortable seats  affordable tickets  quality food     this theatre has it all!,?
1799689,Husband needs total knee replacement  Had an appointment but got a call declining to take him as a patient  Took couple of phone calls back to ask why  Staff says he dont work on knees that have previously been worked on   So if you have had arthroscopic or any work done before and now your knee is totally gone and need it replaced     forget it have to go someplace else  Bummed out as most of the reviews were excellent for this doctor ,?
1800204,Hype  hype  hype  Ive honestly had better  Dont get me wrong  the food is pretty good  but their service is nonexistent  We waited an hour to be seated then another hour for our food to be brought out  They dont even seat ppl in order that they arrive; they seat by preference  I understand that seating is limited in such a trendy and new restaurant  but having such a cocky attitude doesnt help for their lack of accommodations   I probably wont recommend nor will I be back considering there are many other brunch spots that satisfy your appetite without making you feel like youre an unwanted nuisance ,?
1801096,I  was in town for a meeting and group of us was looking for a place we could all have dinner together  The servers at Margaritaville made it happen  They were super friendly and accommodating  especially considering they were dealing with a group of 15 people  The orders were taken and delivered  prompt and efficient manner without sacrificing friendliness or personality  The food was similar to other margaritaville restaurants Ive been too  It was consistently ok  Not amazing  not terrible  Just ok  The drinks however  were wonderful ,?
1801481,I 100% agree with the first reviewer  fantastic food!  The salads were excellent   as were the pastas  And the cannoli was an absolutely delicious end to a perfect meal   For only being open a week   the staff really had their act together  service was excellent   and even though we came in at the start of a rush   everything ran smoothly   Nice to see another great food option in the Junction!,?
1801683,I ALWAYS Come here for my lunch I Mean Who Doesnt Love Chickfilabut on an occasion they looked busy I went through the drivethru and came back to work  I got my usual #5 with my waffle fries  As I was halfway through my burger and fries I spotted what seem to be a SHORT BLACK HAIR in my fries! I refused to complaint because I didnt have my receipt & I refused to go back because I hate being that customer but I will post my review  I go to the location on stephanie street now  if chickfila is reading this you need to do something about people with facial hair  it was gross let me tell you ,?
1801810,I AM MORE THAN IMPRESSED  Not only was this company easy to do business  they were fairly priced  did and amazing job and showed up when they said they would ,?
1802413,I DONT like Boiling Crab  Kickin Crab  or Hot N Juicy   So why did i try this place out? It was a friends birthday  ordered crab legs  mussels  clams  and shrimp and the flavor was good  like really good   if someone says they didnt like the taste  just ask them which flavor they tried  there are more than several   (personally i like kajun and trifecta SPICY) Costs a bit much though  but you already know that going in and get corn and the cajun fries  you wont be disappointed,?
1802817,I HATE PIZZA!!  By that I mean I hate Dominos  Papa John  Pizza Hut  all of those delivery garbage places   Their crust is soggy  toppings stale  and no  no  no flavor   GRIMALDIS ROCKS  which is on the opposite end of all of those worthless places on TV   The crust is crispy  and crooked  and uneven  and just absolutely delicious alone   The sauce is not too sour/sweet  just tastes of fresh tomatoes and herbs   The combination of cheese and fresh sauce  with that crispy smoky crust just makes this place the best pizza period   I had it at the OG Brooklyn bridge location and also drove 30 minutes from the Strip in Vegas   BOTH places are equally good  and yes  Vegas  Brooklyn  or any other city where they open a franchise  I will be there   I LOVE GRIMALDIs!!!!,?
1803293,I Had the worst costumer service at this location   I made a reservation online and when I went in to pick up and try to pay they need two bills to proof of address plus my license  So after driving back home and driving back they said that my bank statement would not be a sufficient proof and they needed a utility bill   Then I ask to speak to a supervisor and the supervisor on duty gave us an attitude and then said I can refuse service   however I  trying to help you  I have been in customer service for a long time and threatening to refuse service is completely insulting to a customer   As soon as he said that I just told him I would go somewhere else   Complete waste of an hour and a half    Although people who work there dont make the policies   they should be trained to handle agitated customers ,?
1803437,I Highly recommend Nenas Waxing  In both Chandler AZ and Yorba Linda  CA  Great Service and Prices  Be sure to ask for Nena,?
1803594,I JUST SPOKE TO THE RUDEST PERSON EVER  Who ever SARAH thinks she is shes crazy  She called me expletives and told me to hold on after I kindly asked where my pizza was after It was clearly extremely late  I ordered at 8:42pm and called inquiring (kindly) at 9:58pm  At dominoes if your pizza is more than 30 min  late you get it free  I was willing to wait a little longer but wow the rudeness from Sarah who was managing tonight was literally intolerable  Im an ASU grad and very sad and disappointed at an institution I use to care a lot about  Shame on you Sarah!  Please me more patient with your customers    ,?
1803801,I LOOOOOVVEEE hash house    especially after long night out    they have an amazing bloody mary  Perfect spice and they put celery  pickle  olives etc  i love my bloodies with a salad on top!! they staff is super friendly and the scrambles   oh wow   i make love to the breakfast menu! I always take out of towners there cause its been on the food channel and they get all excited  Its got a super cool vibe and some days are themed!!  They have a beatles brunch and since im a HUGE fan of those four    yeay   yeay hash house    i love you     ,?
1805235,I LOVE Market Garden! They have great beers  the food is awesome and so is the service   doesnt get much better than that!My favorite time to go is for Brunch on Sundays   They are always rotating around the brunch menu and I think at one point or another Ive probably tried most of the brunch items   However  its hard for me not to get the Chicken and Waffles because its so delicious! (and the perfect hangover cure   with a mason jar of coke)Ive also had great burgers and tacos for dinner ,?
1805333,I LOVE Nicole at Dino Palmieri Salon  She is very kind and always in a happy mood and just a pleasant person to be around  Also    she does an awesome job cutting my hair  Very consistent and I am always complimented by people on how nice my hair always looks ,?
1805821,I LOVE THE FOOD AT THIS PLACE   When I think about it I salivate   I dont know why but the way they do their steaks  or wherever they buy it is fantastic   to start but the longer it stays the worst it gets   Im a rare steak fan    The restaurant is very cute Now a few concerns: Expensive Not Enough Food   Usually eat more after Service is hit and missCost: 2 people  1 apps  2 mains  1 desserts $120180 (depends how much I feel like drinking) Food quality: 5/5Food quantity: 2/5Wine Selection: 4/5Service: 3 5/5Perfect for: First dates  anniversaries  any romantic setting Would I Go Again: Yes,?
1806221,I LOVE THIS PLACE! Not only is the coffee friggin amazing  but the owners are absolutely wonderful  Theyre really friendly and a much welcomed addition to the neighborhood  Songbird really stands out in quality and service ,?
1806634,I LOVE THIS RESTAURANT! The food is fresh  tasty  and unique  I visit every time Im in town  White wine sangria is to die for  Decor is farm chic fancy  My only complaint is that I could not purchase the sangria to take home  as they were out of cans  Next time!!,?
1806980,I LOVE Yogurtland!  Its cheap  there are multiple flavors  and lots of toppings to choose from When you live in the desert  Frozen yogurt is a weekly must 1 star  for having nonfat to lowfat frozen yogurt options   There are lots of flavors to choose from and I like that its self serve!2 stars  for having my most favorite flavors: Peanut Butter & Jelly Sandwich AND the newest flavor Salted Caramel Pecan; to die for!3 stars  for having a wide range of toppings from fruits  chocolates  cheese cake bites  graham cracker crumbs  all kinds of sprinkles  different kinds of chocolate or caramel sauces  reeses pieces chunks  mochi  and one of my ultimate favorites caramel filled cups  best paired with the Salted Caramel Pecan! Yum!4 stars  for the awesome price and 2 sizes to choose from!5 stars  for having themed cups and spoons like HELLO KITTY! :D  Brings the fun out of froyo!,?
1809492,I LOVE this place  I am a sushi enthusiast and this place is the best I have found in AZ by far  The have a lot of off menu items be sure to ask for the chirashi bowl!,?
1809573,I LOVE this place  I was looking for a place where I can focus on writing without a wifi distraction  and Steves Espresso offers that and beyond  I love their espresso drinks as well as scones  I cant wait to go back!,?
1809682,I LOVE this place  Not only is the food delish the coffee is too! I get a vanilla mocha late with almond milk and it seriously lifts my soul to the sky for the day  It can make the crappiest Monday look like a Friday(if it could actually make it Friday that would be even better ;P) but seriously check this place out you wont be disappointed ,?
1809701,I LOVE this place  Skinny Fats provides a pretty decent menu with foods I never thought would taste good together! I have ordered many items on their menu and I was never disappointed with any of them  My favorite is the tunuts dish  Another reason why I rate these guys 5stars is because of the customer service  People on here complain about little things but in my eyes I feel customer service is a must  I ordered smoke in a bowl once and they ran out of rice  bummer  They told me I could order whatever I wanted in place of it  Not only did they give me the smoke in a bowl without the brown rice & the second dish I ordered  but they comped my whole meal! Love the respect  This place is a must try!,?
1810091,I LOVE to end an evening at this cozy little lounge near my house     Smoke a little smoke  enjoy some spirits  and listen to some live tunes  Last weekend  we really enjoyed Eric and Pauls music while we sipped our drinks  They are a very talented pair and we look forward to hearing them again  Very nice bartender  too!FYI  they will begin remodeling this location very soon  making it bigger and better and even more awesomer!  YAY!  AND     Once the remodel is completed  they will have a FULL bar (not just wine and beer)   DOUBLE YAY!Check this spot out if you enjoy live music in an intimate setting  and some quality cigars to boot!,?
1810203,I LOVED Girasole! It was the most adorable spot ever  We came from out of town and walked over to Shadyside from Oakland  Upon arriving at Girasoles  it was PACKED  but we didnt have to wait too long before the proprietor found us a table  In the meantime  Pittsburgh natives chatted with us and suggested popular dishes (the consensus is that everything is delicious)  We got the Bruschetta to start  omg to die for  so delicious  bursting with ripe tomatoes and the perfect blend of herbs and cheese!  My date got the squid ink linguine  and I got the ravioli  The pasta was fresh and so tasty  not to mention piping hot! We had great wine pairings based on the suggestion of our server  and the proprietor and a friend sang while playing the guitar (while sporting a glass of red wine in hand)  It felt very authentic Italian  and cozy  If I lived in Pitt  I would be back all the time!,?
1811147,I Love the Black Bean Burger  So much so I came back two days in a row  As a vegan  I left off the sauce and added avocado  Very flavorful and hearty  And the extra crispy fries were well worth the carbs    I traded the bun for the fries ,?
1811356,I Love this place! The food is amazing! I ordered the white flannel and it was so good!,?
1811917,I REALLY like your new van   It was a very comfortable ride   Both drivers were very  attentive and very helpful  I have to recommend you pay the little bit of extra money to guarantee only one other passenger in the vehicle ,?
1812119,I Really enjoy eating here the flavor is awesome I Havent had anything that I didnt like so far   The wait staff is friendly and knowledgeable    Great atmosphere for dates as well as family    Very good wine selection as well as cocktails ,?
1812285,I Spa nails has very bad quality nail polish and customer service  I would go to another salon if I were you   I got my nails done with shellac and the next day they chipped and I had to go to a special event with with my nails chipped because I didnt have time to get them fixed   I ended up peeling all my shellac off and a few days later went in to tell them what happened   I explained the situation in a  kind manner and they didnt believe me and were quite rude   I will never be going there again and I recommend no one else should go there either ,?
1813176,I absolutely ADORE this hotel  The concept is amazing  it actually makes staying in a hotel FUN again! It is hands down the most unique place I have stayed  They have the BEST happy hour and make incredible cocktails! Well worth a visit  even if you live close by!,?
1813914,I absolutely LOVE this place! It used to be in a Shell gas station but its now in Anthem  where it belongs! This place was featured on Diners  Dives and Drive Ins for a reason! Its Great! If you like Spicy  ask Roberto for his special HOT sauce that he now sells in a jar by the way!You cant go wrong with anything on the menu  Its all fantastic!,?
1814473,I absolutely adore this cafe/Chinese bakery!Stopped in toward the end of day so bun selection was limited   I ended up getting a hawaiian pizza which was ham/cheese/pineapple in a hot pocket shape ($2) and a HK style milk tea ($1 50)   Service was good and they heated up my pizza upon request   Saw lots of other goodies that I want to come back and try   Pricing slightly higher than their Chinatown competitors  however  I think its worth it   Their healthy ingredients take away a bit of the guilt in consuming multiple red bean buns and egg tarts in one sitting  Definitely a nice refuge from the fast food chains and generic eateries on Yonge St and around the Eaton Centre area   Delightful ,?
1814823,I absolutely dig this place  Awesome views  great room! The kids love the pools and driving range  The food and incredible sunset last night were great  The settings are built into the mountain    it is great if you like trails and hiking  Bring your walking shoes and if you are tired    call for transportation pickup    especially if you are going up the mountain to the restaurants ,?
1814858,I absolutely enjoy shopping at this store! The owners are very knowledgeable and friendly   Dont be deceived by the smaller size store as they are a hidden gem that has almost anything you need and even what you didnt even know existed!  Suddenly thats what you NEED   Its always my first goto location before I try any other store(s) ,?
1815216,I absolutely love Bad Daddy (formerly Big Daddys)  I lived in Charlotte for 5 years and this place was my top 3 restaurants  The burgers are great! I only have had the turkey and bean burger burgers  However  every person I have brought here has loved it  The airport site is a good compromise if you cant go to the original location  This was the highlight of my travel  I love the black bean burger with sweet potato fries with the chipotle ranch  Its delicious  Its definitely busy at all times  If you have a short layover  you should order takeout  The milkshakes  fried pickles and tater tots are also tasty ,?
1815742,I absolutely love Kristin  She knows how to improve anyones skin  She will put you on a skin care regimen with products from Image that will work  Kristin being a RN allows her to really understand her clients skin and work with you to improve it  She has taken me from a self conscious person who wouldnt leave my house without makeup to someone who regularly only puts on mascara and some blush  Not t only do I see her for my skin care but I have also had a lash lift  which makes my lashes look awesome  There arent enough stars to express how happy I am with the care Kristin has provided me ,?
1816443,I absolutely love coming here to watch movies  Being able to pick my seat ahead of time and have a cocktail while watching a movie is awesome! The icing on the cake is the 21 and up cinema suites   The food isnt bad but I normally eat elsewhere before heading here  If youre drinking  go for beer or cocktails  the wine is typically warm and a little overpriced  The beer gets you the most bang for your buck especially if you get a pitcher ,?
1816633,I absolutely love everything about this place  The only thing I hate is that I didnt find it sooner! Excellent food and menu  fantastic beer  friendly servers and great decor and seating options   Theres a large comfy outdoor patio  huge bar  and plenty of indoor seating where you can watch cooks tossing the pizza dough   Food    the peanut butter burger (hey  dont knock it til you try it  bro) made me cry tears of happiness  Okay maybe not  but it made my mouth very happy  The meatloaf is KILLER! It aint yo mamas meatloaf with the nasty coagulated ketchup on top  For beer  try the watermelon wheat  It smells like gum and tastes like rainbows   But seriously  its damn good  I love you  State 48  I cant quit you ,?
1817745,I absolutely love the paramount  I lived here a few months back while in school and my friends and I have all talked about how much we miss the paramount since finishing our dance program  I am so excited to be moving back to the paramount at the end of this month  Before making my decision to move back I decided to do a little apartment hunt but I knew nothing could beat the paramount  When I called to set up a touring appt  Jennifer answered and immediately knew who I was  When I arrived at the leasing office everyone was so welcoming and so happy to see me back  Courtney made my application process so simple and even fed me lunch since it was cheese pizza day while I filled out my paper work! During my last lease my roommates and I had no issues at all and I know this coming lease will be the same  This complex goes above and beyond to make everyone feel comfortable and at home  I know that I am one of many to be very appreciative of that ,?
1818138,I absolutely love this Dress Barn store and used to go to one in NY prior to retiring to Charlotte last September  2017   All of the staff are wonderful and always helpful to me ,?
1819359,I absolutely love this place! I come here once a week  and always order the same thing  the bento box dinner special  It comes with a soup  salad  dumplings  rice  salmon teriyaki  shrimp and veggie tempura and one sushi roll! so much food and all delicious  Salmon is always cooked perfectly  and the tempura is the best I have had! Super crispy and tender inside! I will continue to come back weekly!,?
1819552,I absolutely love this place! It has become our new Monday night place since it serves up 1/2 priced Margaritas  The Jalapeno Margarita is amazing     and for those a bit braver  order it with their Tabasco tequila  The staff is very friendly and the service is fast  The second you think youre going to run out of chips & salsa  theres a fresh batch on your table without you having to ask  The dinners are great; Im a big fan of the enchiladas!,?
1819803,I absolutely love this place! The food is always perfect and amazing! I usually get the black garlic ramen  definitely recommend,?
1819921,I absolutely love this place! They are so helpful and informative  Thank you Dr  Beckes for fixing my Rango and for taking the time to call me back about my Fred!! Because of your service I will drive the 100 miles for my Pet needs ,?
1820469,I absolutely love this place   One waitress who gets an attitude and rolls her eyes when she messes up the order can change the good feeling about the place and your meal   Because of 1 waitress though is not going to keep me from excellent food ,?
1821214,I absolutely love this place  The food is the best on W25th and the atmosphere is exactly what Im looking for when entertaining friends from out of town  Best brunch in town (best BACON ever) and was just introduced to their Monday night craft beer night  30 some beers on draft at $3 a pop  Delicious  Give this place a whirl  Great for families during the day  great for partying during the night  Cheers!,?
1821687,I absolutely love this salon!! I always try to get Lindsay  but everyone who works here is recommended! If I ever hear anyone talking about getting their nails done I always chime in to recommend Nails by Karen!,?
1821856,I absolutely love this store  David has always been helpful and knows his products really well  I bought a set of All Clad copper core pans and they are awesome  I was looking into buying a blender and once again David came to the rescue and knew exactly what each product did  Thank you David  and Lyn as well for having the patience with me while I tried to decide what I wanted ,?
1821938,I absolutely love this theatre right here  The comfy reclining seats are awesome  If your an avid movie goer I would recommend getting a stubs card  There is a special line at the concessions for members and you get tons of perks like rewards and discounts  They have a bar inside for those over 21  Crazy soda machine with tons of options for drinks  The theatre is always clean and tidy as well as the bathrooms  Ive always had good encounters with the staff who are helpful  I would highly recommend this theatre ,?
1822406,I absolutely loved the atmosphere   No wait time during happy hour & the bruschetta was AMAZING!  Cant wait to go back!,?
1822822,I absolutely loved this restaurant! I went here with a friend for brunch while on vacation and it was such a treat  I had a beautiful fruit platter spread as a starter and eggs with bacon and french toast as my meal  The atmosphere of this restaurant is lovely as well  Great service by the staff  Im would totally come back next time Im in Vegas!,?
1823385,I actually adore their koryo samgyetang here (ginseng chicken soup)  It is literally one of the healthiest dishes that you can order and it tastes SO good  I didnt need to add salt  the chicken was so tender and juicy and the dish is beyond filling  I would say   dont order it if you dont like ginseng  BUT i would also say that I am NOT a big fan of ginseng and i actually loved this dish and would come back and get it when Im craving something hearty and filling and healthy  The koryo samgytang was $16 99  so definitely a pricier Korean dish  My friend got the beef noodle soup  $10 99  I would say that this is not your typical Korean restaurant  it doesnt have that wide variety of regular dishes that a lot of other restaurants have  rather  they specialize in a few dishes that are quite good ,?
1826173,I adore Chasers and its owner  Jason Went for the millionth time tonight to see some of the bands   Well  only two were playing that I know of and the place was dead   Not the bars fault   I cant believe how much the place cleaned up!  Maybe I need to go on a night where there are more people  but it seems to have changed Their womens restroom is really nice  classy kinda   (I go to a LOT of local music shows and the bathroom is *key*!)Cheap drinks (so Im told  since I dont imbibe) with a great selection   Staff is friendly You see all kinds here  which is why I love it!,?
1826266,I adore Lior! I have purchased 3 fabulous pieces and they are the most exciting  memorable pieces in my whole wardrobe  I am thrilled every single time I wear them  Yes they are pricy  but how many times does one have the opportunity to shop there  They are an excellent investment  You will be unforgettable when you wear them  It does take a credible fashionista to be able to wear off their clothes correctly however  They make me feel like a rock star!,?
1826960,I agonized over who to go to after a few unpleasant experiences since moving to Nevada a few years ago  My teeth are very important to me and I have been to many different dentists and endodonists over the years  The professional quality and skillful experience this practice delivers is the best I have ever had; they are beyond excellent! Five stars,?
1827177,I agree the TV lies & has definitely gone to their heads  The show made a mediocre company lazier and worse and feel entitled  Wear professional clothing when going to see a client and your everyday wear when doing an install ,?
1828638,I agree with some of the other reviews that claim that these are the best wings in town  This location is pretty big  has tons of TVs to watch the game on  and a great menu to satisfy whatever bar food craving you may have  This isnt one of those hoitytoity gourmet gastropubs  Teakwoods is a nitty gritty  fullon sports bar with cheap beer and amazing fried goodies  Weve spent many a night here (kitchen is open later than most places) with their El Hefe style hot wings which are coated in cilantro and garlic  SO GOOD  I usually get the suicide sauce on the side because I am cowardly  Only downside is that sometimes the service is AWFUL  Tons of free parking  free live music  and ohhhhh bumped this to 4 stars because theyve got a Ms  Pac Man machine!,?
1829282,I agree with the reviewer who said they have a love/hate relationship with this store   I dont shop here very often  but I needed a sleeper sofa  and after much online shopping  decided to go to IKEA  chiefly because it sits higher and has a washable cover over a mattress   I went today  112916  especially since I was off work and IKEA was advertising 15% off sofas  ending today   Then when I got to checkout they said this is not a sofa  but a futon and therefore not eligible for the discount   I joined their family and got a free cup of coffee  but I am not happy with that   DONT call an item a sofa if youre not considering it as such   I wanted to argue with the sales associate/asst  manager  or whoever she was  but figured Id write this review and not make a fuss in the line   I hope they are paying attention   Wish I remembered the man outside who helped load my items  he was great and helpful!,?
1829403,I agree witht the below poster  if you ignore the decor   you will enjoy the experience and food   My friend had the vegetarian past (I forget what it was called) and liked it   I ordered the polenta and liked it   As others have stated  the gnocchi was delightful   We ordered two entrees and the small dish deal to receive a free bottle of red wine   I love free alcohol  Recommended ,?
1830359,I almost never write bad reviews but I am making an exception for this company  We had our names listed for two baby gerbils for weeks  When the babies were finally available I asked what the gender was because we wanted to have two of the same sex  I was told I could come in and flip them over and check myself   I was given the option of calling and checking with the owner myself but the owner is only available for 30 minutes from 630 to 7 every day   Ive been calling daily for the last four days only to find out today that they sold our gerbils  Imagine how disappointed my daughter is   She has been waiting for a month for baby gerbils ,?
1830390,I almost never write reviews  but this place was too great!  When we arrived we were greeted with free tequila shots (after ID checks of course) and were seated almost immediately which is rare for a crowded place with a party of 5!  There was live music and the setting is so warm  welcoming  and unique   The food lived up to the hype   I got one of the arepas and it did not disappoint!  Thinking it could not get any better  paying was super simple   You pay up front and it was so fast and easy   I was already planning on returning ASAP and then I got a $5 coupon from them in my email   Im adding Barroco to my favorite Cleveland restaurants   Loved every moment ,?
1830717,I also agree with the first review  I found 20/20 through Dr Rudavsky  who I also found here on Yelp  and who I also thought was wonderful and thorough and thoroughly professional  And  of course  he is a real doctor  not a sales person like the dork who examined my eyes at the fancy Pittsburgh place  As for the glasses  couldnt be happier  Saving up to get a few more pair filled  Barry and Evan are indeed the best   I am a bit of a collector of odd/vintage frames  so I didnt have the same concern as P D  For me  the prices for lenses alone at 20/20 were so good that I had two other pairs of frames fitted with different prescriptions  And when one of them didnt work out for me  through no fault of theirs  let me hasten to add  they replaced the lenses and wouldnt let me pay  Please read that last sentence again  Happy happy ,?
1831281,I always and looking for a good place to have pizza   After a movie at camelview  we stopped into Grimaldis based on a friends recommendation   We had a large pizza with pepperoni   I have to say  it was the most delicious tasting pizza I have had in a long time   The crust is absolutely perfect   It is thin crust  and maybe the best I have had   The crust has a savory tast  I believe it is basted with butter and garlic  but the flavor is mouth watering   The sauce is tomato based  and flavorful  not spicy  but has a great taste   The cheese was also perfect  mozzerella along with the fresh pepperoni is a simple yet great combo   The server was friendly  and very helpful in explaining the menu   The prices are a little high  if all you are used to is calling in a pizza from dominos     but if you want  a high quality  mouth watering pizza  try Grimaldis   I will definitely be back ,?
1831750,I always come here for dinner  either with family or friends  The best dish I love is their Kim chi  Also the famous noodle  You wont be able to take any Kim chi home but this is authentic stuff  If your looking for a nice meal then this is the place to be except service is on the down side  Dont go here if you expect a quick meal  Love this place for the food only  the staff will give you face if you ask for more than water  The proportion are very filling and they always give mint candy in the end  Always room for improvement *service*,?
1831875,I always come here for their delicious ramen! Hands down I think they have the best takoyaki Ive ever had in Vegas  Although it can be a long wait at night  its totally worth every minute  Thanks for keeping my cravings satisfied  :),?
1832341,I always dread going to any medical office  But  at LifeQuest they are always so welcoming and explain why what they are doing is beneficial to you  They are not pill pushers  but rather treat the root of problem than mask it  They are truly there to help you get better  Thanks LifeQuest ,?
1832416,I always drop my stuff off at this location! Staff is so nice and courteous  I was surprised at the good finds you can get here especially glassware This is the best goodwill in the valley to donate too  Com on peeps donate everything here!,?
1832501,I always end up at ShadysHowever  honestly  I find the crowd that this bar caters too  to be snotty  pretentious hipsters Maybe I just dont like the hipsters?I dunno  whatever   The jukebox is nice  in that its different   The Red Elivises are in their jukebox   and I love them :)The drinks are neither cheap nor expensiveThe service is again  hipster and snottyHarold and Maude is usually the movie playing while Im there The patio seems to have shrunk since the smoking banLike I said  the snotty hipsters annoy me  but not enough to keep me outta this place :),?
1834100,I always get the 1/2 spicy chicken and 1/2 chicken katsu plate with brown rice and a house salad I love that for $9 50 this place can fill you up  give you enough of a spice from the chicken and make you addicted to the food  The associate here is always very helpful  He wears glasses  but I forgot his name  Call and order for pickup if you are impatient with waiting for food  The wait is always about 10 minutes The chicken katsu is just decent at best  but the spicy chicken is delicious! I love it!,?
1834480,I always get their FLASHBACK BREAKFAST COMBO or the ROASTBEEF MEAL they have a very nice size portion of food and friendly staff   so far they havent let me down with the taste and quality of food or service   I love going her with my lil one cause he enjoys the food and its the type of food he likes,?
1834484,I always get their breakfast sandwich special combo which consists of a perfectly cooked eggs  ham  bacon and their special sweet sauce  The service is always a warm smile upon entering  Also try their Chai Latte if you are a fan of Chai or want to become one  their dessert waffles and pizza waffles are very good as well  the smell is incredible Mmmm,?
1834727,I always go here  The food selection and quality is pretty good for the price   Love the sushi  love the red bean  mango  and green tea ice creams  Would be higher but the last few times I was there they didnt refill the food and there wasnt a sushi chef ,?
1835689,I always have an amazing time at Luxe! Ive gone consistently every month since October  They have not only helped my nails grow  they also do fun new designs and shapes for me! Highly recommend!,?
1836920,I always love eating at Flancers the staff is always super friendly and the food is always amazing with out question  The ambience is always great as well  Ive been to this location a number of times and Ive never had a bad experience  The cost is definitely a little on the high end but Im sure its justified  This Flancers will always be one of my top choices of where to eat ,?
1837774,I always order with foodie call and these burgers and nachos are just awesome! Long day at work not wanting to cook and wanting a little cheat food this is a great place to get it ,?
1838052,I always receive wonderful service from this Starbucks  Staff is always professional and know how to make the drinks quickly but still yummy ,?
1839043,I always try to give this place the benefit of a doubt because its so close to me and convient   my Brow Art 23 place back at home in SC was amazing   Every time I go to this place I am never 100% satisfied  I am a esthetician so I know how to do my eyebrows I just prefer someone else take their time to do them   As well as I know when I had a half done job   Today was the last straw for me   the lady didnt do a bad job at my eyebrows she just thined them out wayyy too much   At least consult with me first before threading off more than half of my eyebrow hairs   After she showed me my right eyebrow first it was too late   Usually I just come in for a clean up   NOT reshaping my eyebrows   Truly disappointed ,?
1840233,I am Italian  originally form New York and consider myself as a pizza aficionado  I work on Mill Ave and when a new restaurant opens I am always eager to check it out  especially a pizza and Italian kitchen  I stopped by on Paisans opening day and and was greeted by the friendly staff  I ordered peperoni pizza and was not disappointed  The slices NY style  big and ready for the fold  Yesterday  I tried the Veggie Delight Calzone and it was delicious  The calzone is filled with red & green peppers  onions  olives  garlic  mushrooms tomatos and served with a side marinara  The veggies were soft but still had a snap and the dough was crisp but not overdone  I am looking forward to coming back to try the bruschetta  bottomless bowl of pasta  and chicken parm   la buona cucina,?
1840684,I am SO happy to have such a relaxing and classy place to go to in Harrisburg  The menu options are great and the prices are very reasonable  The owner and staff are very friendly and welcoming ,?
1840941,I am VERY pleased with my service from Ecoshine! I was supposed to have my car taken to be cleaned at AutoBell today however  when I showed up at work I saw the Ecoshine tent  My friend was using this service so I decided to give it a try as well  I had no appointment and loved that I could walk up and make one in person  Joe was a very nice guy and explained very well the services I would be receiving  I received a message when Joe started my car and finished my car which was very nice! The service was better than I could have expected! My car is now very clean inside and out! The most convenient part is the fact that I did not have to leave my work desk to sit at Autobell or another cleaning company and wait for my car to be cleaned to my standards! I would highly recommend utilizing this service!,?
1841738,I am a Marriott member and the staff are usually so helpful and kind  Front desk staff here are so rude  Not helpful  Dont try asking a question unless you want attitude back  Hotel wasnt stocked completely and when i asked for certain things to my room  i was told to I have to come downstairs  When i did come down  I was very nice and the woman at the desk was on her phone and was so passive aggressive and disrespectful  I never write reviews  but i couldnt help myself  Great location  but i would go elsewhere,?
1842191,I am a beginner and have taken lessons at Gina Browns  initially I took a private class and then I took a group session     I find the classes large and patience is necessary   When we were in Phoenix last winter I found a yarn store that had open tables and encouraged people to come and knit  if you had a question or problem the staff would help in an enthusiastic and supportive manner   At Gina Browns I felt I was being tolerated but not welcomed   The ironic thing is I would purchase more yarn/materials if I felt welcome and supported at Gina Browns   I am currently looking for such a place in the Calgary area ,?
1842219,I am a big Buffalo wild wings fan  We tried this location for the first time and I will say it was just ok   The wait for food was longer than any other visit at a buffalo wild wings location  It was not an overly busy night  In addition  the order was recorded incorrectly with multiple mistakes   Service was subpar compared to other locations in my opinion ,?
1842363,I am a big fan of Big Bens bar and only recently tried their food  I think this place has great character and it would be a top pick if you have friends in town  They usually have live music on the weekend and some draft specials  They also have a decent sized patio where you can watch the light rail zip by   well  not really zip  but you know  Last visit was for Fish and Chips  Wow  What a huge portion  I couldnt even finish it! The fish was fresh and the batter was delicious! Very happy I tried it! The service was great  and as always  I enjoyed the atmosphere  I loved the old Big Ben  but I love the new one too!,?
1842380,I am a big fan of Burgatory but in the past couple of times  its been disappointing  The food wasnt that good especially the burger buns  The Herbed focaccia is especially bad and it tastes like stale bread  The meat is good as per the usual Also  the wait was exceptionally long  I dont mind it when the food is good  but it hasnt  Im disappointed because for the longest time  it was my favorite Pittsburgh burger place ,?
1843802,I am a customer since 1 year and I am absolutely satisfied with their services  They are so friendly  I always feel very comfortable there  I would definitely recommend this nail salon ,?
1844073,I am a fan of Amelies mainly for the atmosphere   Its a great spot thats open 24 and has lots of quirky decor that the owner has refurbished   The salted carmel brownie is SO good! Handsdown my favorite dessert item here   The french loaf is also really great and I love that it comes with various butters/jellies   I am not a huge fan of the cakes  as they are a bit dry for me  It is definitely a must visit in Charlotte!,?
1844360,I am a fan of all things Zabas  Standard build your own burrito style set up  you have your options set out before you with delicious shredded beef  sweet shredded pork  shrimp and carne steak available  The shredded beef is tasty and can almost always be found in my burrito  White and brown rice makes its appearance alongside the brown and pinto bean duo to fill up your wheat and white tortilla blankets  Something neat about zabas is they introduce different sauces to the mix as well as a queso dip  You can add these to your burrito for an extra kick  On a closing note pick up the frequent buyers card  After so many burritos one shows up free  All you have to do is swipe the magical card ,?
1844551,I am a fan of the original Aurelios in Homewood  Illinois so when we saw a location in Vegas we were surprised  We drove almost an hour to get here and we will totally be back  Great food!!!!! Home food!!!!! Great service  the man working was named Jorge and his was super courteous and helpful  High five for his customer service  We had a good experience so if you are looking for the best Chicago pizza now you know where it can be found in Vegas ,?
1845036,I am a first time home builder and Joe came recommended to me by my realtor   It has been a great experience working with him   He is punctual  thorough and does an outstanding job of explaining issues in layman terms   He reports are very detailed and in terms of his write up as well as supporting photography   His inspections and reports have made the process of building much easier as it has helped me work with the builder in terms of arranging repairs before small problems became big issues    Joe and Alpha & Omega Home Inspections is highly recommended ,?
1845562,I am a grave yard bartender and have ordered from them in the past with no problem but today I call for delivery and they tell me that they dont deliver to my location   I could understand if they said they were busy tonight and couldnt make it but to lie and say they dont deliver to my bar really irritates me   I have ordered multiple times but will be throwing their menus away at my bar   Lots of customers that would order but now I will send my customers to another business   Thumbs down on this place ,?
1845679,I am a healthy male born in 1954 and the office at Dr Aranass office on Bell Rd messed up my prescription more than once  I was told that a needed to come back for an office visit in order to continue my refills no reason given  I made an appointment and showed up as a cash patient and after Dr Aranas took my cash said we no longer want to help you  you need to find another doctor  He could have told me that on the phone or at the very least seen me at no charge  Cash patients not welcome here Poor communication from Dr Aranas ,?
1846394,I am a huge fan of smashburger but this location is awful  Im not a person that complains much but their service is bad enough to make me create a yelp account  Ive had 5 prior bad experiences at this location but kept coming in because I love smashburger and the other locations are amazing top to bottom  I placed an order to go and the place wasnt busy but it took me over 40 minutes to get out of there  After 25 minutes they told me they dropped my burger and told cook to remake it and he forgot  The guy who is telling me this is laughing as he apologizes and said my burger is being remade  Thats right   just my burger  So I get my order and the burger is freshly made but my fries are over 30 minutes old and are cold  I am done eating at this location,?
1847796,I am a new Aflac customer and after having several bad experiences at Las Vegas Dental offices  I read the reviews for all of the Aces Dental offices and decided to try out this office  as the office close to my home was all bad reviews   Upon arriving at the Rainbow office  I realized that all Yelp reviews are written by people that are already upset about something  so lets dawg the business  I should have given the Sunset office a chance  but am glad that i did come to this office   From the time that I entered the Rainbow office  every person was friendly  nice  and sincere   I was in the office for about 2 1/2 hours  and was greeted by 3 different assistants  and 2 different doctors  all welcoming me to this office   I could try the office closer to my home  but these are all great people  worth the drive  so I think that Ill keep this location as my go to dentist ,?
1847827,I am a new client to Body by Kim  When I purchased a package I was told that I would start noticing a change after the 3rd visit  So far I am very happy with the results  I have not measured my waist  however  I can already tell a difference how my clothes are fitting  The staff is very professional and friendly  I would highly recommend Body by Kim ,?
1848140,I am a patient of Dr  Tse  who is a great physician and I highly recommend her   However  once I needed to go to a walkin clinic  when Dr  Tse was not there  I had an nasty reaction to a wasp sting  I saw Dr  Chris Uzoh  and he was very professional  attentive and I felt taken care of  Later I learned that he was temporary suspended in UK for texting some women  sending her flowers etc  That has nothing to do with me or with his treatment of me  So  I would recommend this doctor and would again see him in the walkin clinic ,?
1848575,I am a recent sushi convert  but I am still pretty picky when it comes to your average sushi options   Im pretty willing to try any protein  but I cant stand the texture of avacodo  and dont like the taste of cream cheese   This makes finding a sushi roll Ill enjoy fairly difficult off a normal sushi menu   I was pretty excited when I heard about this place  and have eaten there 3 times in less than a month  As far as sushi goes  the rolls are by no means the best sushi Ive ever tasted  but theyre reasonably priced  and fairly large   A whole roll definitely fills me up for lunch  and I will continue to be a patron of sushi fuku  and recommend it to sushilovers in the area ,?
1849541,I am a snow bird from NY as well and like Erin said although its not the exact caliber it is still excellent pizza    Bring your patience it can be very busy at times   ,?
1850038,I am a transplant to Madison from Va and while I love living in Madison there are many things I miss from home   Chick fil a is one of those things!  I was so excited when they opened one 5 min from my house!  Stopped by the day after their grand opening and was almost deterred by the crowd   Convinced my husband to stick it out with me   Surprisingly the massive line took no time to get through and I got my chick fil a!  This is the only fast food restaurant I ever eat at   Love the food and they are always so friendly ,?
1850890,I am absolutely thrilled with Western State flooring!The Salesman was very good and knowledgeable!I received several calls letting me know what to expect The installation guys were on time and did a great job They left the place clean and neat and were very respectful! A supervisor stopped twice to check on the job  ( nice) I cant wait to have Western Flooring back to do the rest of the rooms Sincerely Joie C,?
1850899,I am absolutely undeniably appalled at the customer service this establishment has   When I was asked  what I would like to eat  it was as unprofessional as it gets  What do you want? HELLO  what do you want I proceeded to tell the woman and she looked at me and rolled her eyes at me as if I was saying something rude when it was just my order  After my order is place and I get my food I see her refuse service to another women who has a trained service dog  Now I understand she has the right to refuse service to anyone but after she did she proceeded to make jokes about the women and the dog when she left  I assure you that Im not the only one who has encountered something like this when eating here  I have seen previous reviews and if I could give this place no stars I would  Disgusted ,?
1850998,I am actually really happy with the place  The decoration is amazing  The food out of this world It can be a bit too crowded  definitely didnt like that  I disliked the sweeteners they have to offer But overall great experience  I would easily come back ,?
1851011,I am actually shocked at the bad reviews for this place! Ive been going to the beauty lounge for about 2 years now  for lip filler  Botox and microneedling  I have never ever had a bad experience  I am always super happy with my results and I refuse to go anywhere else! Indy and nissy (I think thats her name) are both so sweet and comforting and they know what they are doing  they never try to push anything extra on me like most places do! I even had a new nurse for my microneedling yesterday and she was just as good! I highly recommend this place!,?
1851421,I am almost 40 years old and was told my ID was no good   strange place with grumpy incompetent staff,?
1852120,I am always recommending this places to friends and coworkers  What a wonderful dining experience  The entire wait staff is amazing  The food is that much better and you can find a great wine for pairing there  Great to intimate dinners or a night with friends  Highly recommended! Not many great Italian restaurants around town but this is one on my list ,?
1853170,I am appalled after my visit today  I arrived at approximately 11:30 and pulled up to the drive thru window  Several seconds later a man with a deep voice said over the intercom are you asking your mom for permission orrrr? I was surprised and confused so I didnt respond then he said are you going to order now? I was so taken by the tone of his voice that I started to drive off and I could hear him laughing at me over the intercom  I went inside to order from somebody else and I believe it was the manager that got my items to me  He was very polite and quick  That original employee was so disrespectful and rude  I cant imagine the management not providing some sort of script for the drive thru attendants so it would be nice if they could enforce this,?
1854110,I am blown away by this establishment  Their customer service is impressive  not only in the kind and professional ways they interact with their patients  but also in their attention to detail; I showed up for an appt after a year and they remembered details about my life which I shared on my last visit  They make you feel very cared for The service itself is exceptional  I had two cavities filled on this last visit and I was in and out in 10 minutes  I was in shock  I did not feel as though they rushed or cut corners in any way  Amazing service! I moved and am now close to an hour away but I will continue going there because of how excellent they are ,?
1854239,I am bumping this up to 4 stars based on the burgers   I had one for the first time the other day and it was awesome   I went back last night and it was just as good   For the price and the quality  I will probably get these more than the beef on weck now ,?
1855267,I am currently staying at the Royal Palms   The hotel is wonderful   Beautiful setting   I love the Spanish villa type architecture  however T Cook is shockingly awful   I have hoped for wonderful meals at this nice restaurant but everything Ive tried has been a tremendous disappointment   Anyone who thinks they are going to get decadent food at this extremely expensive hotel will be hugely disappointed   F   Outrageously disappointing   WTF ,?
1855719,I am dental assistant and some times need to adjust my back and may neck  I had wonderful experience here  Dr J and Dr Tood worked very professional  I would like to explain about this place: this place is so clean  Staff and the ladies in the front was friendly  I have to say thank you so much Dr J and Dr Todd  They are so awesome  I will tell my friends and family about this place  I give to them 5 stars ,?
1856160,I am eating pulled pork as I write  this review   the keyboard is now sticky with delicious BBQ sauce   Ive gone to their Downtown Phoenix location 2 times now  and hope that they continue to do well so that I can enjoy their food  time and time again  The owner is always super friendly when I come in   Always has good recommendations and always as great food waiting for me  PLEASE support this business   I NEED BBQ DOWNTOWN  and you do too I will be back ,?
1856343,I am excited to endorse Mr  Chris Monzo and Fletcher Jones Imports  After agreeing on the type of vehicle and the price I was willing to pay  Chris told me and my wife that he wanted to make this the best car buying experience of our lives  Give me a little time and Ill find the vehicle you want and the price your willing to pay  Because the model is so much in demand  it may take a while  so please be patient  It took more than a week for him to find the car  as the dealership had none in stock  but he called to inform us that our name was on a vehicle unloaded at the Port of Los Angeles and would be available for pick up in the next few days  Absolutely true to his word  Mr  Monzo  delivered the vehicle on time at at the agreed on price Thank you Chris for doing what you told us you would do  It was  indeed  the best car buying experience of our lives!,?
1856672,I am extremely happy with the work he did for me today   I had two olive trees that badly needed trimming plus a pepper tree   I got another estimate which was a little less money  but Ross (the owner) seemed a lot more knowledgeable and I decided to go with him instead   He arrived by our appointment time and was done within two hours   Ross said hes been in the business for over 30 years   He goes out on every job and brings a helper with him   They did such a good job with the trimming and also with the clean up :)   Wish I could post my before & after pictures!,?
1856734,I am extremely picky about my brows  I cant remember my threaders name BUT as soon as it comes to me I will edit this review  This place is literally 1 min from my house  I was nervous at first because Im so picky but she did an EXCELLENT JOB  The guy at the front was very nice  warm and accommodating  Im loyal so I will for sure be back  I will also recommend to my friends ,?
1857064,I am finally doing a review for this movie theater because they recently upgrade their seating to recliner chairs Palms Brenden Theaters is stepping up their game! Plus  whats better than $5 movies Monday all day,?
1857372,I am from California and I was completely mind blown about the burrito  I kid you not it made my mouth feel so excited  I would definitely go here the next time I am by the strip in Las Vegas!,?
1857837,I am from Oregon and know all about what Dutch is all about  But  cant wait for all of you to find out how this is not your average coffee drive thru  Everyone loves coffee and everyone loves to serve it  what a concept right? If you dont believe me that this is different kind of company find the undercover boss episode and then you will know  I love you Dutch and I am so very very excited about your Vegas expansion !! xoxox See you all every day at the drive thru !!,?
1857925,I am from South Carolina and have had a lot of barbeque; this place is probably the best i have had ever   We had ribs and brisket   Both were meltinyourmouth tender and juicy   They are tomato based sauce with a mild and spicy   Both are great flavor They have a few draft beers  decent selection of bottles available  and margaritas   Great service and easy parking,?
1858490,I am getting a deluxe pedicure as I type this  I like that it is open and not overly crowded  I like that there was no wait  I like that the big flat screen tvs have olympics on and I am truly enjoying this!! They gave me a bottle of water  Most importantly though the place is clean and their processes seem sterile ,?
1858594,I am giving 3 star just because i liked the classic chicken curry else i was so furious about the service I went on a Friday night and totally understand the footfall volume and that can cause delays in service  However  i ordered a tikkichole as appetizer and that took more than 30 mins which is really not acceptable and beside that it wasnt good in taste But chicken curry taste was good and they also give chopped onion with lemon and green chili just like India ;) The waitstaff really need to work on the service and when a customer is asking for something they should return and should not take any request casually ,?
1858805,I am giving Nicks one star not based on the food but how bad I saw the owner Nick constantly berating his very hard working staff today  It really made for a uncomfortable meal as we watched the employees all running around working and Nick just constantly nit picking at them  I will not support a business where the owner has no respect for his employees who make him money   so done with this place unless there is a big attitude change by the owner ,?
1860707,I am going to rate this place high for the Cubano sandwich  which was packed with good pork and ham       but especially for the Espresso  best Ive had since my trip to Havana in 97  And at $2 a demicup  well I had three        great fuel for a late night on the town  My partner recommends the black bean soup and the avocado salad   which was a beautiful presentation of one dead ripe Forida avocado (the big ones) sliced  face down on the half shell  perfectly peeled with a lemon garnish   Excellent   The service  however  was crap        I had to go to the bar to find my waiter who was engaged in conversation with two other gentlemen       in other words  the Espresso was as good as Havana and the service was on par with what the State provides on the Island ,?
1861280,I am happy with this gym  We have tried quite a few other gyms in town lately  just to see what else was out there and we have come back to LVAC  Overall  this gym is the best for size  value and cleanliness  It may get a little crowded at times  but not as bad as some of the other gyms in the surrounding area  Atleast this gym is big enough to hold the people! I have never had a problem with cleanliness  The nice ladies in the bathroom are always cleaning something  I pay my bill each year and just keep it simple ,?
1861428,I am hear quite often  however  my Yelps serve no justice as I had to create a new account as I forgot my password  The little potatoes that are served aside most breakfast dishes for an additional few cents are the best  Crispy  deep fried goodness  I enjoy their staff as they are not forever changing and it is always nice to see familiar faces  Deep fried okra  awesome  Coffee  awesome  Every Sunday they have a trivia question  if you answer it correctly  you get a voucher for a free meal  double awesome!,?
1861529,I am here every week  sometimes multiple times  and a Breakfast Buzz is where its at! That is my goto order  and the chocolateespressobananapeanut butterprotein shake is a little taste of heaven  They have punch cards for drinks  and the staff is AMAZING  They know me by name and always take a minute to ask how I am  I love this place so much Im going to make them Christmas cookies ,?
1862192,I am in Akron/Fairlawn for business and my colleague suggested we eat here  I HAVE NEVER HAD MEXICAN FOOD SO BAD  Honestly!  They provided chips and salsa  it was fine  nothing special     the chips were NOT freshly prepared    we ordered guacamole    again  it was fine   a bit bland and we werent asked if we wanted it spicy or not   I ordered the fajitas with chicken and shrimp    now    has ANYONE ever had bad fajitas?!?! How does that even happen?! All you have to do is spice the protein and cook!! This chicken was horrible! No spices and definitely not cooked fajita style   I literally ate 1 fajita and left the rest of it  The absolute worse fajitas ever  I would have rather eaten them from Chilis down the street  Their fajitas are delicious ,?
1862508,I am in from out of town for Mayo clinic appointments  I picked this spot based on location and could not have been happier! They did a great job on my mani pedi and they were so nice that I ended up sitting and hanging out longer than I needed to since I didnt know anyone in town  Super kind and attentive! Loved my nails!,?
1862941,I am in love with this place  Great positive vibes and always live! That is why chose to here again and again  The Management team doing a great job!,?
1863131,I am in no hurry to return  I know many people who eat here  I often hear good things  I on the other hand wasnt impressed with my meal  I would have preferred to stay home although the manager did voluntarily accomodate me for my dissatisfaction  The restaurant was clean and seemed to have a lot of regulars  I was greeted and seated fairly quickly ,?
1864322,I am loving this place and have already stopped by twice this week! The Human Bean is a drivethru only drink stand that is located right next to the Shell gas station  I like how they have a variety of drinks  coffee  smoothies  granitas  and even a kids menu  I have tried two drinks so far  The Iced Caramel Mocha was a little too sweet for my liking but it was still pretty good  On my second visit  I wasnt in the mood for coffee so I ordered a Strawberry Smoothie  which tasted great! The next time I am in the area  I want to try the Espresso Granita  I love how they give you a chocolate covered coffee bean with your drink! What a great bonus  it will make you smile for sure!! Be careful not to drop it though  as they place it right on top of the lid of your drink  The employees are very nice and friendly  They gave me a punch card  Buy 10 drinks  get a 16 oz  drink for free! Wednesdays are double punch days   This is such a great place  Ill be back soon for sure!,?
1864932,I am new in town on temporary work assignment from ATL and I got delivery from here the other weeknight  I ordered the shrimp fried rice and the shrimp mei fun with a couple of vegetable spring rolls   The shrimp fried rice was a little gooey  but nice taste and quality  just a texture thing   The mei fun was not as light as Ive had elsewhere and they used spaghetti noodles instead of angel hair rice noodles like Im used to   This made the texture with the sauce a little heavy and overbearing   The taste and quality were pretty good though   The veg  spring rolls were the same as youve had anywhere  i e  crunchy deep fried with veggie nougat interior   The guy on the phone told me 4550 minutes for delivery and they were here in about 25 min  so that was a big plus   I will order from here again   It did not blow me away  even for carton takeout  but it was suitable for my fix ,?
1865505,I am new to the area  and after scouring online reviews I decided to come in for a gel refill  On their website  it says a gel refill costs $30 & up  I wasnt sure what the & up could mean  but I wasnt getting anything special  just a normal refill  The whole process was mostly normal  The girl doing my nails took her time  but I really appreciated the close attention to detail  At the end when I was handed my bill I was surprised to see that it was $40  I paid and tipped because I was happy with the job done  but was still shocked at the higher price because I was really expecting it to be $30  My manicure looks great  and Im really happy with the way my nails turned out  However  $40 for just a refill seems a little steep when Ive even been able to get a full set for less elsewhere in the past  Id definitely be back if I could afford it ,?
1865736,I am no expert on Korean food  but Soju was delicious  Whether or not it is authentic  it was very tasty  I got the Gimbap appetizer and the Bimbimbap as an entree  I also had two cocktails  The prices were a little high but the food and the drinks really good  The restaurant is small  which is nice if the restaurant is not busy  Luckily  for us  it was not ,?
1865816,I am no stranger to down and dirty Mex because I love good  authentic grub   Good thing me defiendo bien en espanol because our female server didnt understand a lick of English   No frills interior   I ordered the chicken and bean burrito   For $5 it was the largest burrito I have seen in years   I was totally bummed out by it   Chicken was  thank god white meat  but no flavor whatsoever   The beans were seasoned but in a burrito that large I had to seriously dig for them to get flavor   Too much lettuce   Booooooorring   Zzz    Chips are delicious   Salsa was okay  nothing great   And you WILL leave this place smelling like fried food   Yikes  I wreaked   As I say in all Mex reviews  I love Villa y Zapata for comparable down and dirty Mex   Way  way better food and service   I suggest you dont park like an asshole like I did   But there are literally 4 parking spaces in front of the place ,?
1866209,I am not a big fan of buffet but like everyone else I been going to buffet in vegas ever since I was a small kid with my parent  We basically try all of the buffet in vegas and seem like each year a hotel would try and over do each other  I actually saw this Sterling buffet on the Travel channel so I was alittle curious  So the next time when I want to vegas w my gf and my cousin  we try this place out  Image walking the buffet line seeing raw oyster  chill lobster  giant pawn  and sashimi and you finish it off with sipping champange  I couldnt asked for anything more  For once in my life  I actually enjoy eating this buffet  The only draw back might be the cost but honestly if u r partying in vegas then money shouldnt really matter ,?
1866727,I am not a fan of poor service  If I like a place I will repeat visit  For me to like a place the food AND the service have to be good  The food is actually decent  The service is awful  Dead face   For a place located in a mall I am rather surprised  Or perhaps that is how they manage to get away with it and survive  This is my go to mall  and I was hoping this would be my first to dining spot since I love some savory flavors  Guess not ,?
1866736,I am not a fan of smoked foods or very knowledgeable to what my expectations should be  The service needs help thats a hard thing to accomplish when just opening up especially when you are not a chain restaurant   Besides all that the ribs were tender and moist as well as the chicken both were very good  Slaw was good baked potato was big enough for 2  Corn was good  Heineken needed to be colder  All in all pleasant surprise  Definitely will come back again and try the pizza ,?
1866913,I am not a fried food fan at all     but i have to tell you they have the BEST fried catfish every friday all you can eat for 10 00 AMAZING  I love it  it is not at all dripping in grease and the oil they use to fry it has always been fresh because our catfish has never been served to us tasting like nasty old fryer oil   It has always been beautiful golden brown  This will be my husbands and my 6th fish friday at Pigglys and it has never waivered from the week before  Awsome a must try if you like fried catfish without the dripping grease!! Oh and by the way they serve you just enough on your plate the first time to get plenty full    but it is all you can eat if you do feel the need for more ;),?
1867591,I am not a very happy camper with Desert Radiology as they used to be reliable for appointments   I made an appointment almost a month in advance for 3 procedures and two days before the procedures I called to confirm them   I was told everything was set   The day before the procedures I received a call from Desert Radiology that the guy that scheduled my appointment forgot to call another facility to have them send one of the prior tests over   They would have to reschedule my appointment for a future date  due to their screw up  God forbid they send a runner over to the other company to get the report they needed  Apparently they really dont care about customer service  I have no confidence in Desert Radiology anymore and will not go back to them for any procedures ,?
1867829,I am not definitely not a buffet person  but the food here did not meet my expectations  1  Not worth $80 per person  went on a holiday weekend  so it was probably a bit pricier than usual 2  The food was a bit salty  especially the seafood in my opinion  3  I didnt find any dish that I particularly favored or even liked  The only ok dishes were the Japanese food 4  Servers are friendly and nice  and sadly  I think that was the only pro 5  Would I go again? I dont think so ,?
1868152,I am not going to mark this place down for the outfits  I know the girls are forced to wear them  and few wore them well  but that is the schtick  right? The service was great  Our service was cute and bubbly  so much so I barely registered she was half naked  I thought the food was good  Maybe others did not order the right thing? It is a sports bar  people  dont order a steak and expect Ruth Chris  My husband had the black and blue burger and it was very good  It smelled so good  I grabbed a bite while he was outside on the phone (grandmas 92nd birthday)  I split the nachos with my brother  They were good  but I couldnt find the chicken that was supposed to be on them  If you are on Four Square  you can get half off on an appetizer  which was nice because this place i pretty expensive  Even with a $6 deduction  our bill was $50 for 4 beers  a burger  and an appetizer ,?
1868195,I am not gonna lie   I dont get the Sprinkles buzz     I think they are dry  boring  and not worth the money   My opinion  drive north a few more miles to CupCakes   ,?
1868434,I am not much of a coffee connoisseur  so I probably have no right to an actual opinion on this place  Its funny  I didnt realize that there was any hype to speak of about these guys  it just seemed like another random shop that had sprung up out of nowhere I had the concept and workings of the clover machine explained to me  and it sounded impressive  if not a little indulgent  Buying a regular coffee  *period* whenever I crave one is about the extent of my daily indulgence  and trust me  its enough  It was good  it wasnt clover  and later that day I (100% true) suffered from a concentrated bout of anxiety  It may have been a coincidence  or the hot day  or a combination of things  but I couldnt help but think that the name Manic was chosen for a reason  I suppose its good that they are delivering what they promise: some strong  jumpy beans ,?
1868855,I am not quite sure how you can justify charging $25 for a plate of mediocre tacos  or $29 for a large margarita   Dont get me wrong  I am a big fan of Ciudad in Los Angeles  I have a special place in my heart for the Two Hot Tamales  But seriously  the Border Grill in Vegas is highway robbery  In a city where there is so much good food  and cheap food  and good cheap food  it is insane to waste your time and money here Go elsewhere for some good cheap food and then get a football or the Eiffel tower filled with margaritas for $5,?
1871057,I am on vacation to Las Vegas and broke one of my teeth last night   I just got back from going in to this dentist office  and they did a great job reattaching the broken fragment  its now good as new I had an excellent experience with them  they were friendly  professional  skilled  and fast and efficient   Based on my experience I would highly recommend them ,?
1871528,I am only giving this place 1 star because 0 is not an option! Dont ever try to get an apartment from this place  John will like to you about what kind of apartment you will be getting and you wont find out youve been screwed until after you have put down a deposit  Then  Destiny the manager will pretend to care and then refuse to give you your money back even if you are a disabled veteran on a limited income  Beware!,?
1871893,I am particular about what I eat and I travel frequently which adds a layer of stress when it comes to eating well  I was more than pleasantly surprised when I had dinner at the Penn Avenue Fish company two nights ago  I had a lovely waitress who really went the extra mile to help describe the entrees and make sure I got what I wanted and not order too much food  She genuinely wanted me to be happy and was successful  Next and even more important was the food itself which was outstanding  I had the triple tail special  it was perfectly prepared and delicious  The fish was  mild tasting  moist and flaky with a crisp crust  It was fresh as could be  delicately seasoned and served over seasonal vegetables that were cooked perfectly  I did not have sushi or dessert so I can not comment on either  but I thought about my meal several times since then and wish this restaurant was in my home town ,?
1873363,I am really not a fan of this place and have given it three tries because all the reviews seem to love it  Let me tell you  it is overhyped  The beer is okay at best  and the food is really mediocre  I couldnt find anything that looked good to me on the menu  and the food took so long to come  I would say not to come here for the food  The ambiance is pretty and because the drinks are okay I could understand why people patronize this place  But for those who just want to come for the food  dont waste your time ,?
1873722,I am regular here and they always have hot fresh food good portion  Great fast service  I think prices went up for my teriyaki bowl with brown rice and veggies):,?
1874328,I am saddened to write a poor review of this company  I was very much looking forward to utilizing the services  but it appears this company either is too busy to take on new homes or alternatively does not know how to practice good business  I have left three messages for this company  All three messages were left during business hours  yet no one ever returns my phone calls  When I finally chased them down and actually have someone answer the phone they are reluctant to schedule an appointment that actually works for me  When an appointment is actually made the ladies show up late and do not stay the full time  I was told the service lasts anywhere from 2 to 3 hours yet no one has ever stayed longer than one hour and 50 minutes,?
1874448,I am seriously craving those little toasts with the two kinds of spreadable cheese they bring you before your meal at Flemmings right now   DEAR GOD do you think you can get that to go?I have had a fantastic experience every time Ive been to Flemmings   Great  sophisticated atmosphere with waiters who know their food and their wine   Great wine selection  btw   I always have the filet there and its always cooked to perfection  along with the asparagus and blue cheese mashed potatos   holy crapDELISH   Great upscale date place   Ive also seen groups handled well here too ,?
1874497,I am seriously shocked that this place has a 4 stars   The food was terrible   Everything was luke warm at best  The toast wasnt toasted and everything minus the cold scrambled eggs tasted like it came out of a boil bag  If you want to pay $30 for a breakfast you can get for free at any low level chain hotel  this is the place for you ,?
1875122,I am so blessed to find Dr  Shindell   He truly cares about my daughters scoliosis   He spoke to her (as well as us)  listened  answered all of our questions and was so supportive   I am so appreciative of this wonderful  caring man   Thank you Dr  Shindell!,?
1875964,I am so excited to have Bachi Burger finally on this side of town!!  Great service  great drinks that you dont see other places and the burgers and fries?  Wow okay the best!   The Truffle Parmesan Fries with the Sun Dried Tomato dipping sauce was so good  I cant wait to try their other fries that sounded great too   Had the burger and the meat is so good  The tastes that all come together really create an amazing burger   Must try!  Heard they are going be on Diners  Drive Ins  and Dives on Food Network and I can see why!,?
1876048,I am so excited we finally have a sushi burrito restaurant in Charlotte  I have been to Umami couple times now and each time this place exceeds my expectations  The food is amazing  I like the Zen and the Umami burrito  The sashimi tasted super fresh and all the flavors complimented each other very well  My husband got the Komex which he also loved  Our favorite appetizers are shishito peppers  tuna taco  Tahitian shrimp poke  and the squid salad  We cant wait to go back to try their other burritos ,?
1876871,I am so glad there is a Chicken Salad Chick closer to me now!I frequented this restaurant often when I resided in AL This location met my expectations and I was pleased (great customer service food served quickly nice presentation etc ) Parking can be a little difficult as there are other popular businesses in the same shopping center If you havent been before I recommend you try the grape salad as your side It is my favorite!,?
1877294,I am so grateful that this is down the street from me  My dog has Panis Keratitis and has to be on 2 different drops every day long term  She always gets nervous when she sees a specialist because they have to run diagnostics on her to make sure her condition is stabilized  Dr  Norman and The staff were so warm and friendly towards her that after a few minutes she started relaxing and actually sat down  My dog was able to skip a diagnostic test because the vet said she really didnt need to do it  I appreciated that because specialists arent inexpensive so Its nice to come into an office feeling that your dog is in the best hands I recommend coming here  Yes  the hours are a little limited but its worth it  Its nice to see a friendly and honest place of business ,?
1877609,I am so happy I found this place  I remember the first time I came in (and every time after) the owner and employees were so friendly helpful  and knowledgeable  They are always willing to take the time to help  I had been going to a chain pet store for years until I found out this was a local family owned and operated business  My dog can literally eat only one flavor of one brand of dog food and they always have it in stock which actually was an issue at the chain pet store I used to shop at  I really appreciate that they have a club card for $5 off as well  I recently used the groomer for a nail clipping and I have a very anxious dog but the groomer was wonderful and very sweet to my dog  Also there was a time that I got off work late and really needed food for my dog so I called and Logan kept the store open about 10 or 15 minutes late so that I could get some food  This is a great place all around and Im really glad to support a local business!,?
1877616,I am so happy I found this place  The Tacos and burritos are both great  I had the Assad tacos  fish burrito  and pollo queso  All were so very tasty  I am definitely coming back again ,?
1877897,I am so happy that I found Elements  I was very surprised by my experience  When I walked in I was immediately greeted by kind and helpful receptionist  After that I was taken into my massage  I have to say  I have gotten many massages over the years at another establishment  and this was the best one I have ever had  I am so happy I found Elements! I would never want to go anywhere else!,?
1878900,I am so impressed with Jesse and her company  Its near impossible to find an insurance company that actually returns calls  and is on the ball  Jesse returns every call  does everything I ask her to do  and fast  For those of you shopping for insurance  stop now  Youve found it ,?
1879191,I am so in love with this shop! The tea quality is phenomenal and it makes it even better that the owners are friendly and extremely knowledgeable about their products  Apart from a vast tea selection  they also carry an abundance of delicious spices  oils  and seasonings  I will be a repeat customer for as long as they continue to be in business!,?
1879454,I am so pleased of how well we were treated during the mess of our transmission issue  They were honest and fixed ONLY what was necessary  There are payment options available and they work hard to get you the help you need for it  What I love most is that they want you to come back for a check up in 10 days  Really  what other place wants to know how youre doing after taking your money? Also  they are very helpful with questions on anything and they dont try to choke you down with unnecessary problems  You will be happy to bring your car here! Our Honda Accord is running smooth so far  :),?
1880638,I am somewhat appalled by Mega Bus  I had to change my bus tickets  and they say they make it convenient and easy for you; which they do! However  heres the catch  you have to pay a 35$ FEE to change your ticket  But wait theres more  even though you change your ticket for later  and that ticket lowers; and you still have about 15$ credited to you  they DO NOT let you use that money towards your fee  You still have to shell out more money  F****** ridiculous  considering I had to change my ticket due to a loss in my friends family (whom I was originally going to visit  but had to change trips now) and the funeral being arranged to the date that I was originally leaving  They already have half a rating  I hope this bumps them down more  Cheap tickets  but theyll suck everything they can out of you ,?
1881136,I am speechless about the immense level of teaching skill that my instructor Stan displayed  I dont think Iv met someone more relaxed and well versed in teaching  I went there being afraid of driving  not knowing my left from my right  Stan has made a driving machine out of me  or something like that  I definitely recommend this place ,?
1881367,I am still amazed how little we paid for the nice food we got  I am a chinese  and I will tell you the food is delicious! and their special menu price is so low  I couldnt believe it  I ended up to go 4 dishes on second day  so I can have some at home  Those ice drinks are tasteful also ,?
1881710,I am such a HAPPY patient of Dr Adhikari iv always hated going to the dentist and I can honestly  say she made my experience great I felt no pain while  getting my teeth worked everyone is very friendly as well ,?
1881746,I am such a fan of Portillos after having it at the first location in Sdale and this location is just as great  The employees are all so welcoming and jolly :)I think I love everything on the menu But if you want something sweet  get the cake shake  it is heaven in a cupI am having a salad tonight  the grilled chicken Caesar    :)As much as I wanted the drenched Italian beef  I ate so much this weekend that a salad is much needed Oh Portillos  you shall see me all the time,?
1882467,I am surprised this place can remain open   Staff had a difficult time finding a place to seat us  not because it was busy  but because every table was littered with dirty dishes from past guests   Lobster bisque had great flavor but I dont care for soup that is room temperature   Sandwich was very greasy but the house chips were delicious!,?
1882933,I am the odd duck who actually enjoys house cleaning  However  life happens and I have been helping care for my mom following her stroke and my motherinlaw has also been having health problems so the house just wasnt a priority for our family  After much consideration  I did a search on Yelp and found Busy Bee  The owner was wonderful to chat with when booking and made me feel comfortable about scheduling  The 3 ladies who came and cleaned were friendly and professional and did a terrific job  I will have them back each month to help me stay caught up and have time for caring for the moms ,?
1882987,I am the producer of a feminist film society in Toronto that has monthly screenings aimed at championing women in film  Danny had previously donated a prize to us while she worked at a different business  and reached out to us again once she started one of her own  She very generously donated a gift card for our April 2017 screening of HALF BAKED  That speaks to her personality and generosity  To speak for her work  all you need to do is check out her impressive Instagram feed!Edit: I have now started seeing Danny regularly for my nails (which I bite terribly) and I am  so far  extremely pleased with her work :),?
1883728,I am truly in Awe of this restaurant and their staff  Last night (11/9/18) my self and my two young sons had a reservation to celebrate mine and my husband who had passed  wedding anniversary  Not only was everyones customer service impeccable  but my server alone was outstanding  I wish I got his name  I just want to say thank you from the bottom of my heart for making such a tough day  something special for my boys and I ,?
1883999,I am up in the air on this restaurant  Im not sure whether I love it or hate it  The food was pretty good and after my date raving about the Apricot BBQ Feta Chicken sandwich he was going to have  I figured it had to be good   I got the macaroni and cheese with Lobster & crab  Im very particular about my mac n cheese and this seemed meh  I know  how can someone screw up mac n cheese? But you can and they did  Sorry  date  I ate most of it and it was pretty good but I could hardly taste the crab and lobster and if you are paying for it then I better see HUNKS of it and taste it  The appetizer of New Zealand Lamb Loin was delicious and cooked perfectly as I hardly ever like lamb  My sangria was delish and I would go back for some apps and the sangria  any day ,?
1884179,I am updating my review because the new owner reached out to me right away and offered me a free meal  It was awesome this time and I really appreciate them wanting to make the situation right!,?
1885405,I am very familiar with banh mi and this is one of the best   I have been to ones in California and Chicago   We had grilled pork  spam and eggs  and Korean BBQ   We had green tea with fruits and che ba mau   The food and drinks are delicious   Service was friendly and prompt ,?
1885534,I am very happy I decided to use Mark at Cardinal Carpet Cleaning    He was very upfront with his pricing and less than the other two I called   He was on time and able to make the carpet look new again   I would not hesitate to recommend him to friends and family ,?
1885968,I am very honored to write this review about Julian Serranos master piece: Lago The waiter recommended each person order between 23 dishes and share amongst each other  encouraging a tapas haven Food came quickly and the feast had begun  Every dish was superb  as copious amount of dopamine imploded each time I took a bite Heres what to order for sure:1  Grilled octopus (deliciously tender)2  Branzino (flavorful crispy skin with tender succulent meat)3  Scallops (unreal)4  Baby shrimps in white wine spicy sauc5  Seafood Risotto6  Tripe Risotto7  Crab Salad8  Caprese9  Every desert was spectacular,?
1888375,I am writing this review for John S  in the bar  was so personable! We came in late after a Rebel game and welcomed us with stellar service and always ensured our glasses were full and our food was hot  While we were there  I noticed some regulars who he was greeting by name and vice versa  Hospitality at its finest  thank you John!,?
1889957,I arrived an hour and a half before closing and was turned away because they were booked but we do take walkins   As a first time client (and I brought a friend along) I will not return  Sometimes you have to treat the customer and stay a little later past closing to satisfy the client    or maybe thats just my work ethic ,?
1890571,I arrived in Wisconsin today for the first time and headed straight for The Old Fashioned  Im glad that I did  I had eaten an heavier meal earlier today  so I wasnt as hungry as this restaurant requires  The portions are huge  and the prices are reasonable  But if youre looking for a comprehensive beer menu with a range of Wisconsin brews  and some great food like cheese curds and burgers to accompany  this is your place  And you cant beat the location: right across from the State Capitol  The cheese curds were delicious  but not too greasy  and I loved my cup of chili served midwestern style with spaghetti  cheese  sour cream  meat sauce and onions  I chose a Hef beer for my brew  My bartender server was excellent  and the people here really nice in addition to the tasty food  I recommend the Tiger Sauce for your condiment choice ,?
1890963,I asked a local where to hit up brunch in this hood and he directed me here  A little French bistro with a great menu filled with salads  sandwiches  egg and crepe options  this little place was packed on a Monday afternoon I went with the sandwich and soup combo for $12  The chicken club and a cup of creamy tomato (though as the waiter mentioned  the soup was not too creamy  just a hint)  The sandwich was large with delicious crunchy bread and what tasted to be a homemade garlic aioli  I loved it  The chicken was sliced thinly so you could actually get your mouth around the sammy (we are clearly not in Jersey anymore)  The soup was perfect with chunks of vegetables; I couldnt have asked for a better lunch  It was large but not too big where I felt like death after  Service was amicable if not a wee but unprofessional  food was more than agreeable  I would definitely recommend this place if you are in the neighborhood and need a nice little lunch spot ,?
1891244,I asked for an electrician recommendation from the community media site called Next door Neighbor  Alex Dandoorian if Task Electric came highly recommended  I gave him a try and so happy I did  We had the need for new ceiling lights in several rooms and reconfiguring electrical connections in some others  We found the quote by Alex reasonable for the work involved  And  Alex and his guys are very professional and do excellent work  I would use them again in a heartbeat  Just FYI  Thank you Alex and Task ElectricDebbie Khoshaba Maddi,?
1891517,I asked my nephew where he wanted to go lunch and he begged me to take him to Merenos! It was really good  I had a fish taco and a shrimp taco  Both were super fresh and juicy (the shrimp was my favorite however because it came with pineapple) my starving nephew got the grande burrito and scarfed it down quick  The only thing that would have made it 5 stars was the food took long to come out and our waitress was also the bartender so she was very busy!,?
1891677,I asked them to cancel my service and I would drop the bottles and stand off when I finished the water I had   They billed me twice in a month   They just delivered 3 more bottles yesterday after cancelling the service   I am returning everything today if they will not swing by and pick it up   Very poor customer service and billing!,?
1893667,I ate here for the first time yesterday for lunch! It is one of my friends favorite places  so we went there! I was looking for veggie options  and there was very little to choose from  I landed on the Hipster Wrap with a side salad  Although not an allergy I dont like tomatoes  I asked for no tomatoes and I seemingly got extra? (See photo)  They also forgot my dressing for the side salad and I had to ask for it after I ate half of my wrap  The service was okay  The food was actually good for what it was  I would give this place another chance  beware if you have actual allergies  as they may not take note ,?
1894809,I ate here with friends and we had nearly everything on the menu   I highly recommend the Badger Feast  Food Quality: AFood Quantity: ACleanliness: BDesign & Decor: ANoise Level: AStaff Friendliness: AServer Food & Beverage Knowledge: AOVERALL GRADE: A  (I will eat here every time Im in Madison)PROS: Excellent Brisket  Cheese Curds  Pork Ribs  All the sides were great  The staff is super friendly and the owner even came out and chatted with us  He bought us a free appetizer since it was our first time there and we were outoftowners  They also had live music  CONS: Bathroom was a little dirty  but other than that this place rocks ,?
1894934,I ate here with some friends who work close by  I really enjoyed eating here  They had good food  I had the Pad Gra Prow  I have only really had this in Toronto  I highly enjoyed eating it here  It had a great balance of spices and flavors  I also love the menu! It was super tasty!!I kind of felt lke the place used to be like a pub  and was converted in a thai place  I enjoyed the decor  and i like that they had places to hang your coat  You arent too close or too far from the people that you are eating next to  thus you neither feel crowded nor abandoned  The service is good  I recommend it ,?
1895836,I attend the MSF motorcycle safety course at the Henderson Harley Davidson location  I want to give to big thumbs up  to Chris and Dave  These instructors are very informative and experienced  Taken the 4 day beginners course allowed me the opportunity learn the basics pertaining to safely riding a motorcycle  This is a outstanding course ,?
1896052,I attended a Zumba Class with Jeanne Bavaria today   She is a great instructor lots of good energy    I am fairly new at this and I was able to keep up through most of it  but the class definitely intensified as we went along  slowed down at the end with a short stretching session   Will look for her classes again ,?
1896821,I attended the recent Home and Garden Show in Phoenix recently and scheduled an appointment to have a large picture window replaced and enlarged   Todd Richter was a noshow no call on the scheduled date   I attempted to call that night and got a voicemail box is full so unable to leave a message   I sent them an email which and never received an reply   Called the following day and whatever man answered the phone was extremely rude   I explained that there was a missed appointment and his flipped reply was well I guess we made a mistake after all we are human   Certainly not a company that I would consider at this point   After an entire week I still have not received a reply to my email   I will be sharing this on my twitter account and facebook to warn others that reliability is not as it should be ,?
1898375,I been waiting in there drive threw now for 20 min  This is crazy Im 9 months pregnant an hungry never coming back an I hope the food is good  I order a shake Im sure its nasty by now  Still sitting here waiting 30min later an he handed me a melted shake  Then had an attitude ,?
1898703,I believe I just found the best lunch uptown! Great bread  great sandwiches! Each one better than the next!  I vote best cheese steak in Charlotte     They park Tuesday and Thursday Chima  BOA PLAZA    on Tryon  Great! What a great  find ,?
1899816,I boarded our beloved pet here several times and he was sick every time which eventually led to his death  DO NOT utilize their boarding services  I totally regret sending our pup there  I really wish we had been warned ,?
1900243,I booked a large party for my birthday and the staff was very accommodating  They gave us this beautiful wooden table that had a lot of character  The interior design of the restaurant is extremely beautiful  There is a lot of lighting as well  The music was very tasteful although we couldnt hear too much of it in the dining area  Our waiter  Rod  made sure that things kept flowing all night long and did a good job in making everyone feel respected and appreciated  Everyone at the table really enjoyed their dishes  We brought tiramisu cake from outside and they were very accommodating in letting us eat the cake there  It was hard getting a reservation for 7 PM so we had to change to 5 PM but we never felt rushed to leave  Overall  everyone had a fantastic time and will be returning Thank you for making my birthday memories so delightful,?
1901676,I booked this restaurant for a business dinner while at a trade show  and it was a great choice for the group!  The staff was very helpful  and helped set up our group of 10 people in a nice a nice spot that was fairly quiet and semi private  The food was all very good   The meat platter as the  Appetizer was reall good  epically the duck which literally melted in you mouth!  The stuffed hush puppies were OK  but didnt live up to th e hype the waitress gave them  I had the scallops  which were done to perfection  The only slight nit I had about e dish was it was a bit over designed  with a smoked pork wrapped around the scallops  and peaches on top   I think the food could be a bit more streamlined  but it was really well done   The wine  If list is fine  but a little short on choices  If you a really looking to have a great wine with your dinner  you might consider bringing your own and paying the corkage  I overall  it was a good experience!,?
1902120,I bought 6 cupcakes and1 Salted Caramel nut barThe cupcakes I reviewed on olliecakes  This review is for the Nut bar The buttery shortbread hardly made it out of the bag  It was falling away from the caramel and pecans before I could get to it  Thats annoying  the taste of the caramel pecans was ok to goodish  But having it almost detatch from the shortbread is a no no  It was crumbs EVERYwhere    To bad it it had stuck together I may have given it 2 or 3 stars  also  Im tired of seeing tip jars EVERYWHERE! The guy behind the counter boxed up 6 cupcakes and 1 nut bar  wasnt all that friendly to me ( was to the teenagers girls ahead of me) and he moved on to the next customer before I even signed my receipt      Where would a tip play into that????,?
1903037,I bought a Groupon to get my teeth whitened by this company (they still have Scottsdale and Chandler locations open)  and am very unimpressed so far  I have not yet been able to schedule an actual appointment with them  so this review is for scheduling/customer service and not for their teeth whitening  I have tried getting someone on the phone for more than a week now (calling on 3 separate days and leaving messages each day) and have tried emailing this company  nothing  The voicemail says I will get a call back within 1224 hours  but that is clearly not the case  They have an online scheduling component to their website  but when I tried scheduling that way  I was confused by the options they had listed (not clear on which one lined up with my Groupon)  so I tried calling to clear up the confusion  and again  no response  I feel like this company is a scam ,?
1904429,I bought a honda civic in July and although I didnt like that we had to put $3 000 down I do like the service there  I like how when I went to get an oil change they vacuumed inside my car (which I really needed) and they were polite on more than one occasion   Thank you guys  I know its not easy work satisfying every customer and their needs and wants  Believe me Ive been there  I think people should not take all the negative reviews out of context and actually try and see what they have to offer  Im pretty sure that some people working there months ago that made a person write a negative review might not even work there anymore ,?
1904889,I bought a pair of Kodiak boots from Trove in November and recently noticed the stitching had come undone around the heel   As Im registered on their list  my receipt was online for them good thing too since I couldnt find it! The manager was uber helpful  she switched the boots for the same pair and took the damaged ones back! I thought Id have to deal with Kodiak myself since it seems like a defect of the boot    but Trove took that on for me  Great customer service!! (and yes  the store is pricey but the shoes are quality and unique    as too the amazing selection of jewellery ) I recommend getting on their email list to catch the DEALS! And if you are needing a gift in a pinch  for a gal  go to Trove youll not leave empty handed and no doubt your gift will win big grins!,?
1905100,I bought a set of barrister bookshelves last year for my new store  Robusto & Briar the owner not only cleaned them but held them until I had enough space for them since we had experienced construction delays and a venue change   I would come back here for more pieces any day  They are wonderful  fun  and knowledgeable ,?
1905152,I bought a snug top shell for my truck  The employees were very helpful & friendly  Not to mention they had the best prices in town   Great experience ,?
1905993,I bought my Ian Stuart Wedding Gown at Mariees Bridal! Even though they dont have the largest selection  I think they absolutely have the best  There was not one gown there I didnt find beautiful  The designers they carry are the best  I went to MANY bridal shops and while some stores have endless selections  they pale in comparison to the quality of Mariees gowns  I ended up with a Taffeta ballgown and I went to look at other stores before I finally ended up buying my gown at Mariees The staff are also very helpful and kind  It is intimate and you feel like the store is open just for you  I highly recommend Mariees to and future brides  I cant wait to wear my gown on my big day!,?
1906005,I bought my Kia a little over 2 months ago and Im very disappointed about their customer service regarding me still not having my 2nd pair of keys  Ive been contacting the sales rep and tried numerous times to get a hold of a manager and Ive been sent to voice mail every time  I leave voice mails and nobody has yet to return my calls  I will not recommend this dealership to anyone I know  All I want is my spare set of keys  I shouldnt have been waiting this long  I will be posting this review on every Kia website there is until someone decides to help me out ,?
1906019,I bought my Mazda 5 from this dealership and the entire experience was great  Salesman was friendly  knowledgable and not pushy by any means  So now  I take my Mazda in for its maintenance upkeep at the service department and Steve is my advisor and he is great! He goes above and beyond I think  He always takes good care of me  I think its a great dealership all the way around ,?
1906541,I bought my husband his cake here a blink 182 cake bwcause he turned 23 super yummy hood price and had it ready when i needed it friendlt staff,?
1906760,I bought my wedding dress here and Im so glad I did!!! It really was stunning and made me feel so incredibly beautiful on my special day  The dress I got was from their off the rack collection and was tailored to my size  Im petite and my gown needed a lot of work  They took the time and effort to ensure I was completely satisfied with the end result  The staff here are so patient and understanding even when I was overly emotional during the process (as so many brides are when getting their dresses)  They do amazing work and have some gorgeous dresses available  I highly recommend them  Thank you so much Jealous Bridesmaids!!!,?
1907191,I bought the Groupon  The salon was very difficult to locate because it didnt have any signs and was located in the back of a haircutting salon with a different name  I had to wait almost 30 minutes past my appointment time  I was first told that I owed $5 in tax  and that this had to be in cash  I was then told that the Groupon only covered a small amount of lashes and that there would be a space in the middle of each eye if I didnt pay an additional $20  I did not get a receipt for any money spent  I got the lashes done and it was very fastless than half an hour  The lashes feel hard and plastic and very unlike the mink eyelashes I have had in the past even though they are advertised as mink  Many fell out in the next couple of days after the appointment  This is not a good deal and I do not recommend this to anyone ,?
1907691,I bought vegetables there on Saturday but left them behind on cashiers counter  I returned Sunday and they refused to recognize me (a regular Beacher just down the street from Carload)  nor did they return my money! I will NEVER shop here again  They have shown themselves to be dishonest with me and I shall let all my neighbours aware of their treatment!,?
1908491,I brought a guitar pedal to be repaired and I was told it would be no problem  6 weeks went by and I didnt receive a phone call from them  When I went to pick the pedal up  I was charged $65 just for them looking at it  I dont recommend doing business with them  Also  check the not recommended reviews ,?
1909165,I brought my 2017 Jeep Cherokee from this dealership on April 4  2017   Already have had to replace the Valve Body with Transmission   I now have very serious issue when I fill the Jeep up with gas you can smell gas in the car and when I unscrew the gas cap it gurgles which isnt what I expect my Jeep to perform as I have only had it for less than 3 months   I will be starting the process of having this vehicle returned to dealership ,?
1909258,I brought my 9 year old daughter in for some issues with her skin on her face  Although Courtney Cahill  PA was very gentle and caring with my daughter I will be canceling our follow up and not returning! Even with excellent health care coverage they charge $172 just to walk in the front door   And we didnt even see a MD  who knows how high the bill would have been if we saw a Dr!! Of course they say nothing about this while checking out at the counter so they dont have to deal with the customers face to face   They just wait and send the statement in the mail  When I called to question the charge the woman said Sorry there was nothing she could do   They are obviously owned by a corporation who is all about gouging the consumer   Heidi R ,?
1909499,I brought my babies here for the first time on 9/15  and I do like the place  Monkey and Alffie look AMAZING  I only gave 4 stars  because they accidently cut Monkeys paw pad  I ended up having to take her to the vet  which cost $160 00  The cut was pretty deep that they had to cut off part of her pad  as it was just hanging  So  with ointment  some pills to avoid infection  and a cone   my poor baby had a very ruff day  But  I know accidents happen   so  with that  Monkey is ok  Just sore  Im sure well be back ,?
1909504,I brought my baby  husband and his friends here  we loved it  The service was excellent  we came for dinner at the start of a rush but they were able to answer our call right away  We got the bulgogi  kalbi  and brisket and all were delicious  The cooking surface is far enough away from the edges that young kids shouldnt be able to reach it and every table has a vent so you dont get smoked out  The place looked very clean  the tables didnt feel sticky at all and the cooking areas seemed very clean  We are definitely going to come back,?
1909850,I brought my car to chris at chris auto and he couldnt fix the problem  He guaranteed it would be done in 1 week and kept asking for more time  After 1 1/2 weeks and trying to just keep changing parts  I picked it up and took it to the dealership  They overcharged my a/c and my car had more problems  I will never go there again  Had issue before when I use to take another car there  Seems they always say I bring cars with crazy problems    maybe they need to get better mechanics ,?
1911046,I brought my teenage daughter and niece here for a late dinner   They were in the mood for pizza and pasta   Im a total pizza snob   After reviewing the menu they had several questions trying to find an entree that would satisfy their young palettes   Our server was extremely patient and served us well   I had the Diablo pizza  my picky niece had the pepperoni pizza and my daughter ordered spaghetti and meatballs   Everything was fabulous   We also had calamari and gelato ,?
1911669,I buy some of my fresh produce  snacks  nuts  fruits here in Lake Mead Sprouts as it is near my gym   yesterday afternoon around 7 pm I decided to try the Deli    I had a bad experience    poor service     I waited for almost 10 minutes to be acknowledged     1 staff was helping another customer    has already seen me waiting in front of the counter didnt even acknowledge me or call somebody else to help me      as there were another 3 of them in the work area  Finally after 1015 minutes of waiting after insisting to be served got what I needed    very disappointed  Whole Foods on the other hand although much expensive    I was never treated this way     I would say Whole Foods  is still the best    quality product and service   ,?
1911718,I call CPK  safe adventure   Its great when you have to go somewhere with a large group  and you dont want to cave into a totally nondescript chain   Everyone can find something on the menu that they can tolerate  and I actually think the pizzas are quite good   The prices are average  and the service is typically friendly   The next time you have a business meeting or large group to accomodate  I recommend it ,?
1912097,I called AC Guys when my heat wouldnt kick on after replacing an old thermostat   I called Thursday evening and was scheduled for Friday afternoon  Lou  the tech  was nice and knowledgable   He found the source to be a blown fuse in the air handler as well as a shorted power C wire from the blower to the handler I felt comfortable with Lou in my house as well as his proficiency in troubleshooting the issue   I was charged the $40 00 trip fee and then $80 00 for one hour of labor  which was fair considering he spent more time than that chasing down the short That was my first and only experience and I would use them again   Thanks PS  Wifi thermostat was wellworth the upgrade  changing temp remotely from my phone is glorious!,?
1912408,I called Bryan after hours after the The bigger company gave me the runaround  He was close and his his page said we will make you cool  That is something I definitely always wanted plus I needed my a/c fixed pronto  He was here in an hour and even gave me a military discount after noticing my haircut   He was fast  knowledgeable  friendly  and fair  I will definitely be calling Arrowhead Aire with an e on the end of air again ,?
1913326,I called Mike technician for The Bug Guy LLC  because I had a infestation of spiders  It had gotten the point we didnt want our son playing outside  He came within 48 hours of calling him and he made sure to spray everywhere he could inside and out  Within a few days after he sprayed we noticed there were no more spiders  We also had a bad cockroach problem in our kitchen  he got rid of them as well  Mike comes once a month to insure that the bugs dont return  He is very knowledgeable and makes sure we know everything we need to know about the bugs and the different pesticides he uses ,?
1913511,I called Phoenix Appliance Repair based on the Yelp reviews   Vladimir is quick  honest and professional   He ordered parts for my dishwasher   Once he looked at it  he decided that the parts were unnecessary   He explained what the problem was and did his best to fix the dishwasher   He is on my phone for future appliance repair   They dont make appliances the way they use to and we all need a good repairman   Vladimir deserves a five star rating ,?
1913549,I called Premier Eyecare at 5:50pm to see if they could help get the lenses back into the frames of a visiting family member    The nice gal who answered the phone noted they closed at 6pm  but if we could get there before 6pm  they would be happy to help   We walked in the door with 3 minutes to spare and were quickly helped with our glasses situation     The woman who helped us quickly solved the problem and there was not one hint of we close soon  get out     The family member whose glasses were damaged is visiting from out of town and has no back up eyewear out here   (That wont happen again )    I was so thankful for their willingness to help and their caring and professional attitude   Thank you  Premier Eyecare for being one of the good guys (and gals!)     You have my entire familys business  and we all wear glasses ,?
1914389,I called ahead of time because I had a large group and we came here with a party of 40  And they were able to accommodate us ! We all sat together at two tables which was perfect for parents at a table and players and coaches at another  They helped us with separate checks as well  The food was very large portions and everyone seemed very satisfied  This is a family restaurant with experienced staff! I would definitely come back here again!,?
1915290,I called at 6pm and they told me 40 min waiting come in at around 640 so I got there 635 because I was having my face shaved as well as a hair cut  so I did not get into the seat until 730 and let me just clarify there was not an ample amount of people at all  So lets get startedHair cut  good  nothing crazy I like itShave  not good at all  it felt like this guy was ripping my hair out I should have dry shaved  on top of hat got a nice cut  on top of that I had to go back in after feeling my face and he missed a bunch of spots  missed seriously my whole jaw line  he missed upper lip bottom lip  do not waste your time here the guys down on Arizona do such a better job  and I was very polite tipped the guy  but I feel like I was rushed out completely and I spent 50 bucks  total rip  take your money and time somewhere else,?
1915778,I called for an estimate and they got me right in with no problem!  I have yet to get the work done  but I would certainly use this company!Thank you again for your help  it was a good experience!,?
1916103,I called in an order and it was ready for pick up when I arrived about 20 minutes later   The staff members and I had a few laughs and I was on my way   I noticed there were dirty tables awaiting cleaning but I suppose they were taking a quick break from the breakfast crowd   As I was on my way  I realized I didnt have my drink   I circled back  entered the restaurant and they quickly handed it over   The food was good  as expected   Therefore  4/5 stars for this location ,?
1916207,I called in at 10:30 PM and was told the kitchen is open until 11 PM  I showed up five minutes later at 10:35 PM and the girl behind the counter said the kitchen was already closed  I told her that I had just called in and they said it was open until 11 so she said let me go check  She came back to tell me yeah sorry the kitchen is closed  Thats an unacceptable way to run a business ,?
1916575,I called last night and set and order for delivery  thank god I didnt pay with my card because it never showed up! I never got a call or anything! So unprofessional I will not be ordering from them again ,?
1916960,I called on the phone before I scheduled an appointment to get a quote for my hair and the price I was quoted was just under $100  Mind you I have long hair  I got to the salon and the quote I was given was $160     $160?! ARE YOU KIDDING ME?! I am kicking myself for not asking why  but I did get a student discount  which brought it down to $144  Fine  But then I realized that she mixed the dye she quoted me for and half of it was saturated on the towel  Most places go mix by mix and only mix more as needed  but she decided to just premix a ton and charge me for all of it  I didnt appreciate the fact that she did that  She did a nice job  but in all honestly I felt super ripped off  I probably wont come back here ,?
1917506,I called the salon desperate to get my bushy  grownout pixie looking presentable  I was able to get a sameday appointment with Paige  Paige was sweet  funny  and really knew her stuff  She took her time to sit down with me and understand what I was going for and what I was willing to do  She also took the time to explain exactly what it was that she as doing and why  Was very pleased with the outcome and will definitely be coming back!,?
1918550,I called three upholstery cleaning companies in my area  Neshoffs was the first to return my call  The rep I spoke with gave me an estimate for cleaning a sofa  I booked an appt and the day of which  I received a call 30 min prior to alert me that a technician was on the way and gave me his name  Jeremy (technician) arrived promptly  looked over the affected areas I pointed out and got to work immediately  Jeremy was quick and my sofa looks and smells CLEAN  Jeremy was knowledgeable and gave me advice when I inquired about leather care for some of my other pieces of furniture  Would hire again and would refer Neshoffs to my neighbors/friends ,?
1918786,I called to get a quote to replace a window that broke in our living room   It is a single window that cranks open  but they said they dont do that  they would have to replace the whole bay unit?  Its not connected to any other window  none of the other units need to be replaced as they are not broken   Extremely unhelpful ,?
1919342,I called to schedule an appointment and they said just to come in about 30 mins  so I did  Next thing you know they said it was a 40 minute wait  Bad customer service and a waste of time  Not sure if they are allowed to schedule appointments but at least honor your word   Its inconvenient to find parking      get down     and go inside Walmart ,?
1919478,I called to see whether this store was interested in purchasing any books and the woman who answered was rude because she was uninterested  She was not taking any  which was completely fine  so I thanked her for her time and hung up to call other stores to see if they were purchasing  Im on google so Im just going down the list and calling the different used bookstores and I guess I accidentally called this number twice and the woman was so beyond rude the second time I called I was honestly speechless for a few seconds  I apologized for accidentally calling her twice and asking and she just hung up  I was appalled by such unprofessional and honestly just sad customer service  I would never step foot into this store and I am recommending that all else do the same  or even call to ask any questions  unless you are prepared to be yelled at for asking a simple question politely ,?
1920867,I came back here a day after and got the same drink  QQ mango Taiwan juice with coconut jelly and pearls  This time I got no ice and 0% sugar and a large  This was much better  I would never get ice there again! And 0% sugar is perfect  Yum!!!!HIGHLY RECOMMEND 0% sweet and No Ice!!! Large is the size Im used to and a pretty good deal for the extra $! YUMMY!!!!!!!!!!! Oh and get their stamp card if youre a local  I need to try more drinks here!,?
1921512,I came during a non busy time and everything was perfect  Great decor  yummy sangria and the chicken burrito with the side salad was delicious! A bit expensive but good if you want to treat yoself  Very nice staff and service was prompt ,?
1921912,I came for lunch to try out their AllYouCanEat sushi   The server was nice  the sushi chefs were funny and the sushi was great   They didnt take very long between rounds of sushi and seemed to actually encourage ordering multiple rounds   My favorite was the Unagi Nigri Sushi and dragon rolls   I also had the California Top Fresh Water Eel Roll which was loaded with avocado and topped with Unagi   The deep fried Haha Roll was good as well as the spicy Mido Roll   They nailed classic rolls such as the Rainbow Roll and Shrimp Tempura Top Crunch Roll   I was too full to try the Chicken Deep Fried roll but have something to look forward to next time   Excellent experience and I will definitely be back!,?
1923686,I came here after looking for a florist with good reviews in Richmond Hill  I searched many florist websites and noticed that all the floral arrangements were based on what seemed like stock photos with a white background  which seems to be a standard in the market I decided to go into the store to inquire whether I could see some additional/actual photos or details to make sure what I was getting was actual what was pictured/what I wanted  The lady in there brushed me off with the pictures are what you see on the website   well  duh  She basically told me it would turn out to be exactly as the photo  so I proceeded to order a deluxe size floral arrangement (~$110 after tax) Upon picking up my order  I was pretty disappointed  The floral arrangement did not look nearly as beautiful as it did on the stock photo   and some of the flowers had wilted the next day   such a waste of my money and definitely did not receive the service I expected for the price ,?
1924131,I came here and got the hot/cold combo and let me tell yoyu it was better than any spa service I had  My pants were a little tight and so they gave me disposable shorts to put on  Then I got a massage it was an hr including my face arms back legs feet  They even used hot packs and hot stones  In was in Heaven  typically I tell them to go softer or harder but this guy knew how to read my body  when it was too hard within seconds he eased up just enough  I love this place and am coming back,?
1924289,I came here around 7pm with a friend last week and we sat up on the top patio area  Its three stories so this place is huge  but each bar has somewhat of a confined area so it might get a little cramped if you come here with a big group  We had three beers each and our tab was only about $15  gotta love that  Be sure to checkin to get 1/2 off your first drink!They played a good mix of music on the patio  We were there for a an hour or so and heard everything from country to dance to hiphop  Great place to kick back and have a few drinks! Ive never been here late at night so Im not sure how loud or packed it gets  but Ill definitely be back again ,?
1924853,I came here bc I just landed in vegas and I was starving  Overall this place quenched my hunger but nothing to rave about  I had the sloppy joe burgers which taste like the manwich dinners you can make out of can  My friends had the onion burger and the salmon with cream corn  which were pretty good  Prices were decent  my sloppy joes plus drink came out to $22 This place has no happy hour specials which is sad bc most other places on the strip seem to have some kind of deal going on ,?
1924881,I came here because I bought a discount card  and Im glad I did  The first service I used was getting my hair cut  and I was booked with Julie  who happened to be the owner  She is from NY  so we had a lot in common; however  the cut held up awesome  She takes her time to get what you want  and so it looks good  Julie is now the only person I use  I also have gotten a brow wax  pedi and mani  I loved the wax  the pedi and mani was ok  I prefer my regular place  but again  she took her time and did a good job  The entire staff is nice and friendly  It is small  but reasonably priced ,?
1925419,I came here because of all the rave reviews because I am a follower  The place is tiny and usually packed so get your food to go if you can  and be prepared to wait  The food was pretty good  nothing to write home about but it was a decent meal  I had the chicken and waffles and the chicken was delicious  the portions were generous  Its kinda cool that you get to see the chefs cooking right in front of you and theres the added bonus of peace of mind over the *ahem* purity of the food    What!? Havent you seen Waiting?  im not crazy  All in all  it was a good meal  the chili syrup was pretty original and the homemade coleslaw was cool  Drop by if you can but get that ish to go ,?
1925668,I came here before it was just about to close for the day  which means most of the meat were already done  Although  the toppings were nice and fresh and it was pretty good!I recommend coming earlier   this why the meat will still be there and available,?
1926055,I came here during the weekend and it was soo packed during the early hours already!! We left our phone numbers at the restaurant for the waitress to call us when a table is available  Kookminhakgyo is a smallsized restaurant that gives a real Korean KBBQ experience  You can barbecue the meats on a barrellike table  Its definitely a cheaper option than other KBBQ places because even if you order a la carte  you will still get all the side dishes  spicy soup and steamed egg  The steamed egg was AMAZING!! Ive always loved steamed eggs but Kookminhakgyo made it so flavourful and yummy!We ordered:* Pork belly* Pork neck* Beef fingerstrips Id recommend getting the marinated options on the menu because the meats that we ordered didnt have much taste  unless we used their sauces  Id come back to order other items on the menu  Overall  the service was excellent and I really appreciate how diligent and quickly the servers worked to clean up our tables to get us seated ,?
1926063,I came here during their grand opening for their 50% off all you can eat special  I thought that the food was good  Some of the rolls were a little messy but they were very busy so I understand  The wait was around 30 minutes and it was a little annoying because theres not much waiting space inside so we had to wait outside  in the heat  for most of the time  The service from our waitress was not great because we would have to wait so long for her to take our order for more rolls  but she was nice and it was understandable because of the amount of people she was helping  Overall I liked the food and the service was okay  but I think it will get better with time and when theyre less busy ,?
1926414,I came here for St Patricks Day  No food specials  no drink specials  When I asked the server why there were no drink specials she said people will come anyways I should have left on that note   But gullible me stayed on the promise of Irish music and entertainment   Just because U2 is from Ireland doesnt mean they play Irish music   The Irish entertainment was some bagpipers for about twenty minutes and some girls dancing for thirty   It was a very sterilized atmosphere    Not a party   Do yourself a favor and go downtown next St Patricks Day  they will show their appreciation for your business ,?
1927615,I came here for a second opinion My kitty was very Ill and on her way out I was given good advise at the other hospital but needed confirmation before i had her put down Making decisions like that can be very emotional and painful especially when your best friend of 13 years is dying The last thing you need is to come to this place so they can proceed to make you feel guilty for not spending thousands to put her through more trauma than she needs on her last days When i chose to not follow through with their plan since obviously i didnt have the cash They move to the threatening approach  trying to make me feel like a rotten person for choosing to take her home Face it what kind of sick vets work here while your losing your best friend they want to con you I dont think this place has the qualifications to save any pet They might as well have the standards of a puppy mill Stay away from this place at all costsYoull regret it if you dont!,?
1928014,I came here for an out of province inspection when I was purchasing a preowned car   I was cautious because it was my first car purchase  and was a private sale   I like that this place would be completely unbiased  as opposed to a dealership or mechanic who would profit off parts or service   This place had a great website and their prices were fair and in line with typical inspections   I was also a huge fan of their online booking system  super easy to schedule an appointment They did a great job  afterwards the technician came out and explained to myself and the seller in detail the problems with the car   He was very willing to answer any questions I had My only recommendation is to bring a book/magazine/laptop or friend with another car   It is located in an industrial area off Macleod Trail  with nothing walking distance around   We were pretty bored for 2 hours   They do offer free wifi in their office Overall  I would highly recommend InspectaCar ,?
1928580,I came here for dinner before the rush  It was clean and the staff was good about fielding questions  Very reasonable prices  Will return ,?
1930759,I came here for the UYE last night and loved it!  The staff was simply the best and the food was good   It was my first time at one of these seafood places and the staff talked me through the entire process   I ordered a pound of shrimp  medium spice  with the sauce being the Hot N Juicy which is a combination of all their sauces   you put on your bib and some plastic gloves and when your bag of goodness arrives  you dig in and start taking off the shells After awhile  I got really frustrated with the slowness at which I was removing shells   I took off the gloves and then the process became easiermessier fingers but faster work Robin was our main server and she was a GEM!  What a pleasant woman and what a help!I will be back   This is one of the things I do by myself unless my wife wants to have fried chicken fingers   How you limit yourself if you dont do seafood!,?
1930982,I came here for the first time because my daughter recommend it    They have the best hot and sour soup!  I also love their teriyaki chicken    Will definitely be back ,?
1931483,I came here for the impossible burger  which certainly didnt disappoint  I got the Fun Guy with no cheese and the Impossible patty  really good! The burgers dont come with any sides so we ordered a side of fries  Theyre on the thinnercripsier end  not my favorite  The B spot has 6 different sauces on each table  including the usual ketchup and mustard and then some more unique ones like a coffee bbq  There is also a pickle bar  once you get your burger  you can go to the bar for pickles and other pickled vegetables  The space is a good size  not too big  Service was nice and quick  I would return for the impossible burger but not the fries ,?
1932420,I came here last night to get my eyebrows threaded   I love that they are open until 9PM as it is very convenient to go to after work   The eyebrow threading was fast and great   Im happy to have found a spot so close to home!,?
1932773,I came here late on a Sunday night for the first time  I have heard about this place for a while  My wife had the corn flake chicken sandwich and I had the Freedom Toast  it was the brie that sold me  Overall the food was pretty good  but nothing mind blowing  I would come back again just for the milkshake  I thought it was pretty cool that they put slices of pie into your shake  We ordered the vanilla with apple pie and it was really good  Id give it 3 stars  but the bartender/waiter earned an extra ,?
1933446,I came here on a Friday night because I was tired and wanted something quick/cheap in the hotel that was not food court fare  This place is open 24/7  which is awesome because the food is great  I got the Omaha (corned beef  sauerkraut  Swiss cheese and thousand island on toasted and buttered rye bread)  It was delicious  and so was the pickle that came with it  They also have a case of desserts and several different treats of the month  I picked up their cookie of the month  which was a massive brookie and it was probably one of the best Ive ever had  I paid $17 for these two items  which is a little on the expensive side for not having a side/drink  but its Vegas so I cant say Im surprised  Its great food 24 hours a day in the convenience of your hotel  what more could you ask for?,?
1933856,I came here on a Sunday afternoon  around 2pm  Bartender was very nice  But  thats about all I can say thats positive  I hear that they have a good happy hour menu  but unfortunately I wasnt there during their designated times  As a result  I paid a huge premium for very average at best Sushi  My nigiri salmon was so fishy that I wondered if I should be eating it raw  The rolls were assembled poorly with sloppy rice bits everywhere  The overall experience was disappointing  to say the least  I realize you are going to pay a premium at Scottsdale Quarters because the restaurants overhead must be out of control  But at least put a good product on the table ,?
1934317,I came here on a nice Friday afternoon and had a craving for burgers  As Im on a plant based diet  burgers are hard to come by  especially a good tasting one   Ive had the burger from the Planta restaurant before and it is delicious  I ordered the Jackpot burger and while it was tasty  it was kind of soggy   I also ordered loaded queso fries  which essentially is a vegan version of chili cheese fries   It was okay   Personally  I think the burger at the Planta restaurant is better   They seem to take more care and pride in the food there   However  keep in mind  that the combo here cost me about $13 and usually the combo at Planta proper costs more like $25  tax and tip   Would I visit again? Sure  but I wouldnt make a special trip just for one of their vegan burgers ,?
1934432,I came here on a tip from Misti   The place has a very cafe feel to it  with trendy music and a cross between a coffee shop and Thai atmosphere   I could definitely see myself just hanging out here with some friends after enjoying a good meal I ordered the pineapple fried rice and the Lad Na   The pineapple fried rice was tasty  with a nice (medium) spicy heat   Everything was fresh  and the pineapple wasnt canned   The rice was slightly greasy  but the nice taste made up for it   The lad na wasnt bad  but it wasnt the best either   The pork was nicely prepared  and the Chinese broccoli was nice and fresh   I wasnt to into the gravy sauce though   It was thick and full of taste  but it tasted too much like teriyaki sauce   The food here isnt completely authentic Thai  but its still good   I would enjoy eating here again with friends   Very cool atmosphere  and pretty good food!,?
1934986,I came here once and ordered the vegetarian and I can tell you it will be the last time I eat here  The sandwich was borderline inedible  It was essentially just a pile of mayo on white bread  just a few shreds of iceberg and a little tomato  I didnt see any of the avocado that was supposed to be on it and I asked for sprouts which werent included either  Sent it back  they added the sprouts and avocado but it was still a sad excuse for a sandwich ,?
1935574,I came here since I required a smog check  I was told I needed some parts and labor  I ended up paying through the nose for shoddy maintenance and apparent defective parts  Not a well kept area either  housekeeping practice requires attention  Needless to say  they are a scam and will take you if you dont know better  Go to a more reputable place and do not let these people take you for hard earned cash  Read the other reviews that are poor they are true   the good ones are a smogscreen!!!,?
1935595,I came here six years ago and remembered a more reliable halibut ,?
1936434,I came here to get a few drinks  but we didnt order any food while we were here  It was a great time! Marcy was the bartender and she was really nice and friendly  They had a live band the night we were there which made it a fun environment to hang out in ,?
1937514,I came here today for the first time  I booked a massage with Kyle and let me tell you something    he is a GEM  I have a stressful job and as soon as I got into the room  all of my stress melted away like butter  I met the owner while I was there as well and she is so invested in her business  I would recommend this place to anyone in the area or from out of town  A,?
1937748,I came here twice and both times I ordered the fish and chips  One piece of fish with chips is enough for me  The fish was well cooked and the sauce was also good  Overall the price was cheap for such a dish  One piece of fish with chips costs the same as a McDonalds combo ,?
1937831,I came here twice in my week in Pittsburgh  One of my favorite Asian restaurants  Excellent service  Excellent menu (explained in English)  Excellent pad see eaw  Excellent coconut rice ,?
1938468,I came here with a Groupon and was very excited to have their vegetarian equivalent of butter chicken  I ordered it with naan and enjoyed a mango lassi on the side  I thought the food was well done and not overly greasy  It was served in a timely manner and the restaurant staff were very friendly It was a very quiet restaurant  we went on a weekday evening and we were one of three tables  Id recommend it especially if you can get the Groupon because you will get incredible value for your dollar  Without the Groupon  I would probably order a little more conservatively  I would say that two people could split one main dish and an appetizer  along with naan  instead of having two main dishes Overall great food and relaxed  quiet atmosphere! Great for conversation because theres no need to yell  and a nice change from the usual bustle of Torontos dining establishments ,?
1940554,I came here with my family at noon on a Saturday and we stood in line for at least 45 minutes   (No surprise )  We eventually got seated and the service was decent  could have been better   (But hey  Im here for the food!)  The food spread was great in that there was quality and variety   Youve got your seafood  your sushi (limited variety here)  your meats  breakfast foods  pastries  fruits  salad bar  pastas  Chinese food  fruits  ice cream  mini cakes   (Im probably forgetting some  but you get the idea )  I missed the dim sum that Cravings has but my family said that they had gone to Cravings the previous day and it was terrible in that they had gotten rid of a lot of stuff  such as the dim sum   Disappointment!  The consensus among my family was that everyone was very happy with Bellagio   Ill be back here   Forget Cravings ,?
1940603,I came here with my family for korean BBQ  This place was not all you can eat so its a little pricey  The meat dishes are like $25$40 per plate  However I did think it was tasty  The beef brisket was the best one we tried  Its sliced really thinly and I thought it was flavored well The sesame oil plus salt combo is gold  This is my favorite sauce combo for korean BBQ meats Prime and short rib were good I thought the beef sushi was weird  Teriyaki sauce was on it The side dishes were a bit lacking  I didnt see too much besides kimchi that I liked  I really wanted potatoes or the fish cake!The shaved ice dessert was good  I think it was supposed to be snow  The condensed milk topping was the best ,?
1940692,I came here with my family on the weekend  We thought we would try out a few old fashioned sodas and sit in the park and chat  The drink: we had the lemon Ricky  cherry cola  and a chocolate malt  All were really tasty and prepared right in front of you  The restaurant: SUPER clean and ultra retro decorations  The staff were insanely friendly and the fella at the counter chatted with my mom for several minutes about their food  The best part was about 20 minutes later the owner/manager (not sure) came down to the park with free pastries from the cafe and thanked us for visiting! Talk about customer service  Ill be back for sure ,?
1941110,I came here with my husband and daughter this morning  The wait for the breakfast club was over an hour so we came across the street to the Montauk  I could not have been happier  We had the most amazing food and the staff   I cant say enough  We never wanted for anything  I created a yelp account just to let people know how wonderful it was  I have been in the industry for 15 years and I can definitely say that this place was created with true passion  I am not impressed very often  today I was blown away  My compliments to the chef  while I would not wait an hour for the Breakfast Club  I would wait an hour at the Montauk  It was that good ,?
1942638,I came in after having heel pain/plantar fasciitis for two months due to standing all day at my job  I called three podiatrists and was able to come in and see Dr  Swenson the quickest  Came in  had some xrays taken  and Dr  Swenson came in to talk to me  We discussed options  he gave me a list of stretches to do  and fitted me for some insoles for work  Lo and behold  my heels were free of pain within a couple days! I have not had heel pain since   I am glad that he didnt just give me a steroid shot because that wouldnt have been a long term solution  I like that his staff is efficient and unlike other doctors offices  I didnt have to wait long for the doctor to see me  I highly recommend seeing Dr  Swenson!,?
1943217,I came in for a Gel mani and a deluxe pedicure! My nail tech was Cindy and she was awesome    She was very particular with my nails making sure they came out perfect which is great! For my pedicure I decided to go with the Pearl Spa pedi and I will tell you  it was amazing! The smell was heaven! Vincent did my pedicure and he did an amazing job on making me relaxed and giving the best massage with great pressure! Im pregnant so it was just what I needed! The spa chairs are great  The service was great and they are very attentive which I like! I will definitely return and try out all the different pedicures! Oh and the gel selection is GREAT! Tons of colors to choose from!,?
1944971,I came in no one spoke & I felt like we were wasting their time  I would never tell anyone I know to come to this location,?
1945090,I came in on a Friday morning appointment for an oil change  recall software download  and to install a set of valve extenders on my dually  They charged me $30 for the install  but did not do the installation  They said to come back Monday morning and they would install first thing  So I came in Monday morning at 7 and Steve said less than an hour    Two hours later  they brought the truck out  I noticed when I got home that 1 extender on each side did not have the lock nut to hold it to the bracket  Total bullshit  wasted my time and didnt care ,?
1945222,I came in on a busy Friday night with my friend and was pleasantly surprised to be seated within 15 minutes  We sat outside on the patio and had our chips and salsa served promptly  I really liked their tomatillo salsa which was a little on the sweet side but spicy  I had the fiesta burrito for dinner and my friend tried their Gecko burro which came with spinach cheese sauce  Overall so good and great quality food! Will be back soon! Also want to steal the bean dip because It was so delicious  Try that with your meal instead of refried beans you wont regret It ,?
1946566,I came in while I was on vacation in Scottsdale  They were nice and fast  I got my septum pierced! They dude was nice and fast  Ill be back next time I visit!,?
1946629,I came in with a friend around 9pm on a Saturday evening  and were seated quickly  The ambiance was very nice  with red walls  dim lighting  and candles on the table  Our waiter was very welcoming and thoroughly explained the menu and some details about the restaurant   He was also helpful with the wine list and brought some wine for us to try before ordering   We werent too crazy about the breadsticks   My friend ordered the Bavette al Cedro (lemon  Italian butter  Parmigiano)  while I ordered the Gnocchi alla Lupa  Both were absolutely delicious! Ive been wanting to return just for the Gnocchi  which is filled with ricotta cheese instead of potato   The portions are rather small for the price  but the food was delicious nonetheless!,?
1946735,I came in with an aftermarket wheel/tire combination that multiple shops in Madison  WI could not get on their alignment rack due to a multitude of issues including overall weight/height of the truck/camper   They were able to get me in touch with another business on my travel route   The extra mile they went to is something you just dont always find   They are an honest business and I wouldnt hesitate to come back here when Im in the area   Thank you!,?
1947139,I came initially to use a coupon I had received by mail   I needed a haircut and  coloring/correction   The place is spacious  modern and inviting   Cindy took care of me promptly  and offered me to change into a clean  coverup/kimono (to protect my clothes)   She made some suggestions for the regular haircut I requested  and I was  happy I listened; haircut layers gave extra bounce and shape to my hair   The color was fine  she closely matched the color of my hair It was a relaxing experience and I will return soon for another trim   Happy to recommend this place ,?
1949158,I came to Kasa Moto for Summerlicious on a Friday night   For starters  the service from beginning to end during our dinner was incredible   The servers were extremely friendly and attentive and not pretentious at all   Our group had the tofu salad (vegetarian however amazing) and ceviche to start   For mains we had the arctic char  wonderfully flavoured  buttery  and a pretty large portion   not to mention it came on top of a sweet puree and edamame   For dessert we had the chocolate stone (chocolate heaven) and the shortcake   The shortcake was dry and underwhelming ,?
1949281,I came to Le Basilic Vert for lunch with my coworkers  Walking it I quickly found the relatively modern and pretty though it needs to be better maintained (Outside walls had holes  aquarium didnt seem to have been cleaning inside and out for some time  the floors were dirty)  The resto was pretty busy which led to some considerable wait time but I was encouraged that this many patrons being here would lead to a quality meal due to its popularity I went with their Pad Thai ($15) which came with a soup and roll  The soup was good  the roll was thin & crunchy    just right  The Pad Thai was good but Ill admit Ive had far better  The coworker who ordered the same meal as me all felt the same  I would probably bet there are better choices on the menu My experience was a 3 5 but rounded down  Will come back and try something else and get this can get bumped to a more respectable 4  Maybe by then the place will be cleaned better ,?
1951089,I came to the restaurant as part of a Century 21 convention and awards ceremony for the first time recently   I was amazed at the level of service particularly from a gentleman named Rodney Lennon   He took the extra time to provide a true level of care and service and I look forward to returning with friends and family in the future ,?
1951469,I came to this location because it was close to my work  I had got a gel manicure  when I normally get my nails done with gel they normally last for about 2 weeks this time they only lasted a week and they started to chip so I am a little disappointed but the staff was very friendly and the place was clean but I think if I paid 35 00 for gel they should last a little bit longer then a week ,?
1951668,I came to this place 4 Times Yesterday  I decided this will be my last time Low quality  unprofessional waiters and bad service 1 low quality service  when I pay money I expect good service 2 the waiter dropped the food on my wife  he did not help even  He ran away like if nothing happened3 the waiter dropped the bill  he did not pick it up 4 there was additional item on the bill  the waiter waited to see if I will check  then he said ooh sir   I am not sure  but did you order this item?I go to this place just for the experience  if the experience is not good any more what else I will for Unfortunately  I had two foreign people from Spain yesterday  I liked to show them this place  I was disappointed ,?
1951708,I came to this place and ordered chicken tacos  The girl serving me was completely bitchy not to mention the fact that I felt like I overpaid what I ordered  Ive tried their other location on College and I found a better experience there  Sadly the richmond location Ill never return  Service was HORRIBLE ,?
1952606,I came upon this place one day in Jtown  due to being too lazy to drive far  A memorable dish was the pork stuffed chicken wings  however it was more like dumpling fillings inside the chicken wings  not actual meat  but the dish was enjoyable nonetheless The place is rather spacious  and quiet for an izakaya so would definitely recommend for large groups  (You dont have to yell to hear each other)Pricewise  it is actually a bit pricier the north york or downtown izakayas  but the quality is just not the same unfortunately ,?
1953272,I can always count on World Harvest having whatever I need to make a special meal  Knowledgeable staff make great recommendations and know their merchandise ,?
1954864,I can not even begin to explain my love for this place   The food   The ambience  The margaritas   I always always always get the mole enchiladas   It is truly the best thing Ive eaten  The rice and beans are so good   Javiers margarita is in my top 5 of all time   Its so beautiful and romantic in here   The chips and salsa are warm and crispy and so good  Service is always spectacular   Water glasses are never empty   I go to this place at least once if not twice every time I come here  The bar is also very fun   After lunch or dinner we usually stroll over to the bar and have a nutty banana martini   Pure happiness all around  This is the place I most recommend on the strip!!!,?
1954977,I can not imagine a better experience with a realty company or agent than we had with Dave Dix from Long Realty  When we encountered structural difficulties with our roof while we were 1200 miles away  Dave coordinated the three contractors needed to repair it  he met them at obscene times in the morning allowing them access to our home and helped guide the process of its repair  He has always kept us informed  followed up on our requests to see homes (etc) assisted us through the process of selling our repaired home and getting another  The team of realtors from Long Realty that have worked to sell our home have been incredibly courteous and have gone the extra mile to be the least disruptive of our lives as possible Dix is unflappable  knows everyone (great list of service providers) and has been just superb  I can not imagine anyone receiving anything but exceptional service from Dave Dix!,?
1955461,I can not tell you how impressed I was with Roadrunners customer service! I called in a panic due to a flower emergency  and while they could not fulfill my order on such short notice  they called me back to give me the number of someone that could! This was definitely above and beyond  and I cannot thank them enough! This kind of service is rare to find these days  I will be using them more in the future!,?
1955798,I can only give an average rating   The service was awful  it took forever to get our food and the place wasnt busy  The food was ok but not great so I just cant recommend this place over 3 stars,?
1956902,I can see this restaurant becoming our go to Italian! Ordered the Burina Pizza to share  which was fantastic  Best Pizza we have had so far in Toronto next ordered pasta which was freshly made  one Ragu and one Cream sauce  both of which were fantastic  particularly the creamy one which was not heavy at all Coffees to finish were also good Only thing lacking was the service  there was only one waitress looking after a lot of tables  will not stop us going back just hope they have more servers next time ,?
1957639,I can usually find what I am looking for  Clean store  Quick service if you go during the day  peak hours are torture however with long waits in the check out line  Although I can never really find the clothing I see online that should be in store  sometimes its just not at this store and Ill end up ordering online ,?
1957830,I cant anymore  I used to love this place  Id find a way to sneak off for a couple of hours of alone time just to order the chicken/asparagus/risotto dish they used to have  This place held good memories of date nights and celebrations but then they changed the menu a year or so ago  Got rid of all of our favorite things  We went back once  struggled to find anything that sounded appetizing  and havent been back since  Its too bad  That risotto with the tomato water was to die for ,?
1957878,I cant be more pleased with Shawn and his service   He drove out to my office today to install a receiver hitch onto my Kia that I purchased in July   I backed my car up onto his ramps and left him to finish the job  He called a few minutes later asking me to come outside because there was something he needed to show me   Seems my car was in an accident in its previous life  which ended up bending the frame  Shawn had a blanket laid out so that I could look at tee damage firsthand   Because the frame was crumpled near the rear  he couldnt installtee hitch  I told him I appreciated the info  and asked what I owed him for his troubles   Buy me lunch  sometime was his reply  Shawn is a class act  and a trustworthy businessman   I highly recommend his business ,?
1957990,I cant begin to say how great Unicorn  has been for my success and goals with my weight loss journey these past two years  I lost thirty pounds within the first year and then gained back 10 so I went back  The doctors and staff are very supportive  Special shout outs to Cynthia  Christine and Theresa!,?
1958011,I cant begin to tell you how awesome my experience here was   The staff was friendly and very patient with me   I didnt have time to special order anything   and needed to get something in store   I am also plus sized  picky  anxious   and my wedding was a surprise    so I was shopping alone!  Lol! Huge shout out to Ariana  Katie  Kelly  and I know I am missing one or two people that were also really helpful   Huge thanks to two ladies in alerations  Corinna and unfortunately cant remember the name of the other person   sorry! You helped me find my dream dress even under the circumstances   I felt more beautiful than I have ever felt in my life in that dress  Thank you for your patience and your assistance with finding my perfect dress and helping my little surprise Christmas wedding to be that much more magical  You are awesome   I will recommend your store every time   and Id give you 10 stars if I could   Thank you ladies!!,?
1958435,I cant believe I have never reviewed or checked in here before  We go all the time and its boyfriends favorite burrito place I always get the adobada and he gets a variety of things including the rolled tacos which are always good  The breakfast burritos are great too The people are always super fast and nice and its cheap!,?
1958583,I cant believe I havent posted a review yet  Ive been coming here for over 2 years now and Im beyond happy  Ive been seeing Xochitl and she is amazing  Ive lived in Vegas now for 15 years and have tried different stylist and salons and she is the one I know Im sticking with  I was referred to her by a mutual friend and by far the best referral Ive ever had  What I Love about her is that she listens to what I want and puts her input in as well  I trust her so much that I just come in and ask her to do what she thinks or wants  My color always turns out amazing  Ive never been complimented on my hair as much as I have now since she has been doing my hair  The color lasts and the grow out looks good  Everyone at the salon is friendly  The salon is beautiful  modern  nice and clean  I love how they offer refreshments and always ask if Im doing ok while Im under the lamp  I recommend Xochitl for anyone who is looking for an awesome colorist ,?
1959979,I cant believe it took me so long to finally try out this nail salon! I desperately needed my nails done so around 9:30pm  I walked in and was greeted by the friendly receptionist  Although this place stays open late  it was still pretty packed when I arrived  They made sure to find out exactly what services I needed done and had me seated promptly  Andrew was my nail tech and he did such an amazing job! I wanted a specific design on each of my nail  which he patiently took his time and really exceeded my expectations  He was very precised with the details   This is the first time I actually felt that my nails were not being rushed on  Overall  I received amazing service  from all the staff that I had encountered with  I will definitely be returning soon!,?
1960975,I cant believe this place has no deal for lunch menu to go  I ordered half a chicken for $9 95 you would think its a combo  Nope its just the chicken no nothing included if you want rice its extra  And I agree with one of the review it is very loud inside  Very expensive not worth the trip for lunch ,?
1962634,I cant express how happy I have been with Kabuki!  The food is amazing!  Service is outstanding!  The location is a million dollar location!  Sushi doesnt get any better : ),?
1962701,I cant fathom why anyone who has tried the Wingery wings would ever choose to go to another place specifically for wings Yes  I live down the street from them  but Im also walking distance to another wing place (selfproclaimed Best in Oakville) and a short drive to a large wing franchise  When the Wingery first opened  I wondered how they could make a go in a Cclass strip mall with a pizza place that sold wings and a bar that had some decent wings  but from the moment I took the first bite  I knew they were not just the best in the area  but the best I ever tasted The wings are huge  the chicken is moist  the bite is crisp and all the sauces Ive tried (from a Mild BBQ  to Swamp Sauce to Gates of Hell) all pop with textured flavours  even Gates from Hell  which was a fight between the pain from heat and the desire to taste the sauce again Foodies and wing fans  if you dont even try this place  youre a damn fool ,?
1962775,I cant find any words to describe the food at Pita Jungle other than hearty and delicious  The portions here are generous sized but prepared healthy so you can indulge without feeling guilty Im not a big fan of hummus or even the pita dishes so I go either for their fish or their wood fired chicken  The wood fired chicken in particular is served with delicious  zesty garlic tomato sauce that almost make your toes curl  Accompanied with mashed potatoes  this is probably my favorite dish Unfortunately Ive only ever had Pita Jungle as takeway so Ive never had the eatin experience but I bet the food is even better dinning in     some day ,?
1962999,I cant get enough of this place!!! Love going there a few times a week  Lunch  dinner and the brunch on weekends AMAZING!!! I have had pretty much everything on the menu and each and everything is delicious!!! Whether you want to sit at the bar and have one of their incredible cocktails or sit on the patio and get some fresh air  A must go toSpot on the west side!,?
1965306,I cant say anything about the food  the rooms  the shopping  or even what it looks like inside I always WIN when I play here   I dont know what it is about this casino   It just brings me luck   Doesnt matter if the dealer is a mean mugging old Asian geezer or a sweet white lady with a super teased frizzy perm   I always win   Any business that puts money back into my wallet is 5 stars ,?
1965308,I cant say anything about the quality of their food  I only sat at the bar long enough to enjoy a couple of beers and watch some March Madness  The quickest way to turn me off from returning to a restaurant is to let me whiteness the person who is serving me stuff food into their own face  While I understand that it was a slow night hardly want to see my bar tender stand behind the bar and consume a protein or weight loss shake  Next quickest way to not have me return: not washing your hands after touching dirty money and then touching plates with food on them ,?
1965696,I cant say enough about butt out  Ive been going there a little after they first opened  The staff is super friendly and overly knowledgable  Upon going there you are always greeted with a smile which is more than most other shops  The juice lines they carry are amazing  and they just released a new one the other week called 7 days which is absolutely amazing  Unlike other shops the encourage people to become active in the vaping community and also dont mind if you hang out at the shop which most other shops dont want you doing   Quit accepting quanity over quality and give butt out a try! You wont be sorry!! I am giving this review 5 stars because it is the ONLY vap shope that has fully satisfied my needs and treated me like I was family!,?
1966086,I cant say enough about this Jersey Mikes and their staff  I went in there and orders several subs during a dinner rush  When I got home  I realized that they had messed up on one of my subs (nothing major)   so I gave them a call and they took my name down for next time  The next time I came in  they comped my entire order! Talk about customer service! They were polite and professional both times  They made a loyal customer out of me   The food is incredible too  make sure you try any of the cheesesteak subs ,?
1966209,I cant say enough about this place! Its absolutely amazing!!! I wish we could give them 10 stars! The staff is so friendly and really cared for our girls  They stayed in the deluxe room  which was extremely clean and spacious for our two labs  We watched them on the webcam during their play time  which was so refreshing to see that they were ok and having a good time  It can be a tad expensive  but I would pay anything to know my dogs are safe  having fun and are in good hands  We have had some bad experiences at other dog boarding places and this place will always be our pick and definitely recommended to everyone we know  Thank you Henderson Pet Resort for taking care of our girls! :),?
1967296,I cant say enough good things about this dealership  Everyone on staff is incredible at their jobs  My latest trip to the service department was yesterday  Lauren was always smiling and she went above and beyond my expectations  I hope she gets recognized for her excellent customer service  I drive 40 minutes to this dealership because its the only one I trust  Gaudin Ford is definitely closer to me but they tried to swindle me for thousands of dollars on the purchase of my vehicle  How many dealership service departments do you know in the valley that gets 5 star reviews?Anyways  great job guys!,?
1967930,I cant say enough great things about this Buca! Coordinator Ashley is amazing! Planning a wedding out of state while attempting to bring together families from two different cultures for a large event is a difficult task but Ashley and the Buca crew helped make that dream come true! Our rehearsal dinner was a huge success! Everyone loved the food! Everyone had a great time and its all because of the staff being attentive  welcoming  and personable  They made us feel right at home! And huge thank you to Ashley the bartender who helped us out together a custom photo shoot for myself and the bridesmaids that Ill never forget! You guys are amazing! Thank you for making my special day one to remember :) ,?
1968785,I cant say we were thrilled with what we received  We ordered so we didnt get to experience the atmosphere many people seem to like  but the food was just average  The meatball appetizer was only two small meatballs for a seemingly high price  only one of the two pizzas we ordered was delivered the first go around   Luckily the Uber eats driver was kind enough and go back to pick up the second that was not given to him an hour later which still wasnt that great  We probably wont be trying here again,?
1969001,I cant speak for the coffee  but the food is pretty good  From what I see its all vegetarian!! Yay!!! Seating seems really limited though and the whole front area was just filled with a large group of guys drinking coffee/tea and watching tv  A bit intimidating and not really a cafe feel  May be best to get your food to go ,?
1970019,I cant thank the staff at Acura of North Scottsdale enough especially Kelly  Terres  and the manager Steve Hoffman! Everyone was so friendly and made the car leasing process as enjoyable as it gets! The staff at Acura of North Scottsdale were patient  friendly  and helped me through each step with a smile! Of course  I had hundreds of questions on both the car and the leasing process and everything was explained fully without any pushiness or impatience! Thank you! Im smiling ear to ear in my new car! Would recommend Acura to anyone!,?
1971581,I cannot comment on the food; the closest that I got to it was what I saw on the menu and on the unbussed tables surrounding us Seated for 20 minutes without a single acknowledgement by any employee  it was time to leave   When I told the host what happened  he uttered not a word I would give this negative 20 stars; I am ashamed that I have to give it one  I expressed my displeasure on twitter as well Avoid this place at any and all costs ,?
1972132,I cannot get enough of LGO My favorite time to come is very early in the morning to enjoy the sun coming up over Camelback Mountain while having some organic coffee and a blackberry bran muffin The breakfast at LGO has something for everybody  IMO  Try the Croque MDame if you want something really bold  The lunch and dinner options are great too  This is the only restaurant I have ever been that I could eat all three meals and feel like I was being served from a different kitchen each time The only draw back I can think of for LGO is the tendency for it to become very crowded  Thats the best problem a restaurant can have  so theyre probably not too worried about it  The parking situation can become an issue too  but for my time and money  its worth it LGO is top notch in my book and you can find me there pretty regularly ,?
1972245,I cannot give enough praise to Yalla!! I went there with a Groupon and it is now my new favorite place to eat  Between the homemade pitas coming right out of the oven and expertly  freshly cooked and healthy entrees  I had trouble deciding which was best  I tried the Chicken Shawarma Wrap  and Falafels and stuffed grape leaves and Baba Ghanoush   was exceptional ! Then Homemade Baklava to top it all off  Not to mention our lovely waitress  Audi  who so graciously brought us her fresh  homemade mango drink to sample! The warm  loving atmosphere added to our enjoyment  as well as the Ethnic music playing!! Cant wait to go back!!,?
1973249,I cannot say enough about this place  It not only provided us with a fantastic meal  but it cured my best friends broken heart  Food:Falafel with hummus  beef & lamb kabob and chicken breast were excellent choices  As for sides  the white cabbage really stood out  Delicious! Service:Attentive and attractive pretty much says it all  Look for Sean ,?
1973412,I cannot say enough good things about Crudo  The brisket is the best! Chef Cullen is one of the best chefs in the valley  Crudo is the perfect place for a date night,?
1973566,I cannot say enough good things about Porchetta Roll  Everything about this sandwich is pure perfection  Its been about a year since I was last in Rome  where my favourite lunch was porchetta sandwiches from street stalls  Porchetta Roll honestly  has come the closest to that taste in the GTA  I would rank them higher then Porchetta and Co for sure! If you can  take another person with you and do some mixing and matching (or just indulge yourself)  I would highly recommend the Porchetta sandwich  the Shrimp Po Boy and their persian potatoes  All of it is tender  juicy and flavourful  Ive visited here a few times  and its always consistently delicious ,?
1973621,I cannot say enough good things about UFO   I needed four upholstered chairs reupholstered and got onto Yelp to find someone   I called a few places and Leonardo was the only one that answered his phone  was available immediately and was efficient in producing an estimate   Leonardo and his fellow upholsterers told me where to buy my fabric  were courteous  efficient and turned my chairs around in record time   So professional and my chairs turned out beautifully!  I found my upholsterer and will be sending my family and friends there as well!,?
1973623,I cannot say enough good things about Urban Orchid  The friendly and extremely talented staff gave me everything I wanted  I had ordered two flower crowns  two boutonnieres  and a bridal bouquet  I sent in a picture of what I had in mind and they exceeded my expectations  The flowers were fresh  beautiful and they held up all night! They really went above and beyond for me and I thank them for that!,?
1973880,I cannot say enough good things about this place  I discovered it before it opened and met the owner (the lovely Abdul) and told him I would be back  and I meant it! I took 3 friends here during lunch time on a Saturday and it was absolutely wonderful  Abdul is a great host  bringing out various courses to share between us all  I wish I knew what they all were! The veggie salad/dip with the pita bread was delicious  along with olives in oil  We decided to order the lamb couscous and the bastilla (my FAVORITE!) and even though I dont like lamb  I found the couscous delicious  The sauce was phenomenal and the veggies were cooked to perfection  And the bastilla!!! I want to eat this every day  He then served us these delicious smoothies and cookies for dessert  Literally everything I tasted was yummy  Not only that  but it came to about $10 per person  Well worth it in my opinion! We plan to go back here very soon and I cant wait!!,?
1974212,I cannot say enough nice things about Dr  Nicholson  After having a procedure done with a dr at the cancer center Dr  Nicholson took the time to talk to me before my exam and answer any and all questions I had  All of his nurses are fantastic and just the whole thing was just so calming and informative ,?
1975407,I cant say enough about this place  My biggest recommendation  eat off the main menu 1st  Chef Tom is spot on with his modern twists on French Cuisine rich  delicious  and well prepared  You can tell his technique is impeccable  Im not a trained chef but I eat allot  this gent knows what he is doing  The most interesting option Lumiere offers is the Tuesday & Thursday specials  Tuesday classic country style French food ($25 or $30 with glass of wine paired with the nightly dish) and Thursdays  they run a Lobster special which is awesome! Roasted Lobster with butter poached claws!!! WHAT! Yeah  amazing  ($30 Paired Glass of Wine) In regards to service  Waiters are down to earth people you would want to grab a beer with  Brian took care of last night  good dude  All in all you can see the team effort  great service! GREAT SPOT!!!,?
1975935,I challenge you to find a convenient restroom in this mall  I walked around for 10 minutes before I gave up and asked a vendor  Answer: Upstairs in the food court ,?
1976118,I checked Yelp for a good Sushi place in Vegas and ended up here after reading the reviews  Good Choice! The food was great  tasty original rolls  very fresh fish and yummy appetizers  all you want for $26 95? Sold!!!! The chefs were fun and made several special things for us to try that werent on the menu  we had a party of 4 and were seated promptly at the bar next to a couple from So Cal who found it on Yelp as well  Thanks for the spot on recommendation Yelpers!!! We will be back ,?
1976846,I checked this place out on a Sunday afternoon before heading back to Cali last weekend with a couple of heads  I saw previous reviews and pics on this place and wanted to give it a try  I would recommend coming here if youre with a group of friends and are ready to have some food and drinks and shoot the shit   So  we ordered the chicken skins  deviled eggs  and bacon jam to start off with and all were destroyed in seconds  After that they ordered burgers and I ordered the wild boar Sloppy Joe  which I thought was decent even after having those small plates which were full of flavor   If we werent leaving that day we would have ordered more and would be drinking  but since we werent I felt like we didnt get the full experience of this place   Ill make sure to comeback and not be as hungover and tired  Based on the food I give it 4 stars ,?
1977596,I chose this company primarily because of the reviews  and Im glad i did because they did some great work!I called in today to see if they could clean the carpets to the house I was vacating  Spoke with Brent  He sounds shy and reserved  I can see where people may mistaken him as stuffy but he was polite  My carpets had no stains  Just dirt build up from shoes  They came out today  and my landlord was super impressed by their work  No haggling on pricing  They gave me a rough estimate  but they didnt charge me more  No surprises   Im glad I found a good company  I didnt find them to be expensive  Ill be using them as my carpet cleaning choice from now on ,?
1977810,I chose this place for my birthday and it ended up to be the perfect choice  Service and ambiance were marvelous and I was really happy! This is what we ordered: Jumbo Lump Crab Cake: all crab meat with hardly any filler  AMAZING Lobster Bisque: Not a bisque person but it was so delicious here  yummy!!! White cheddar & bacon grits: creamy and cheesy  oh so good! Wild sauteed mushrooms: Perfectly cooked and well seasoned  Pair with steak very well Bone in rib eye: Nice big piece of steak with a bit of fat  which is the way I like my steak  Chateaubriand: 2 big pieces of fillet Mignon that also comes with a side of steamed asparagus and mashed potatoes finished at table side for two people  Fillet was SO tender and juicy  probably one of the best Ive had! Not an asparagus person so it was bleh  Mashed potatoes were ok  I would love to go back again with my boyfriend and have a romantic dinner ,?
1979185,I come here all the time and every time the staff is so friendly  This is always somewhere I think of to grab a quick  healthy bite to eat ,?
1979361,I come here all the time this place has great vibes and awesome service! This is my Favorite allyoucaneat barbecue  delicious food  good price  and the customer service is the best that there is compared to any other place I have been! I recommend this to any friends and family looking for amazing food! I give this place 5 stars and two thumbs up!,?
1980077,I come here every 3 months to see keely their hygienist  She is the only reason I continue coming here  Plus shes the only consistent person Ive noticed  Every time Ive seen a dentist Ive been told the previous one no longer works there  Keely is great about planning out my cleanings based on what I can afford but their dentist always try to pressure me to spend thousands of dollars right then and there on painful procedures that I would like to plan in advance for  Their office staff changes often as well but I have noticed the new girls are much more friendly and attentive ,?
1980250,I come here every so often to check my tire pressure and although theyre always so busy  they help me out in a flash! I try to tip a dollar or two whenever I have cash  Also mentioned to them that at my last oil change  the dealership said I needed new tires ASAP  They reassured me that it wasnt an ASAP tire change but  maybe in the next 6 months  It was reassuring! And gives me some time to save the dime for these said tires lol Be sure that Ill be coming back here for the tire changes :),?
1980297,I come here every time I go to Vegas  Love the ambiance  love the view  and LOVE the food! Great quality of food and that fancy restaurant feel without an exorbitant price ,?
1980558,I come here for 2 things  The Range and Airsoft Games The Customer service here is just great! Friendly staff  very helpful with questions and very professional  My experience here with the range thus far is just top notch  it may be quite far from any tourist attraction  but if you want a shooting range i would say its worth the drive if youre from out of town   Typical and good prices  great selection of guns as well!As for Airsoft  in the summer the games are usually night since its so hot  and most of the ops are on Saturdays  Games are organized through meetup com and i believe the Pro Gun Club is just only letting us airsofters play here  There are no rentals (yet perhaps) unless you ask a player with an extra gun Great experience everytime i go out and shoot or play  Definitely worth checking out  Safe shooting ,?
1982048,I come here once a month to get my nails done   While Friday evenings and Saturdays are impossible to get in on  Ive never had to wait longer then 30 minutes Its tucked away at the end of a strip mall  but such a great find!,?
1982125,I come here once awhile for Ramen  Great atmosphere and service   Food are fresh and nicely presented   However the potion might be small for my stomach and taste is too salty side for me    otherwise its a great lunch out place ,?
1982334,I come here quite a bit and its generally the same thing  Quick to seat  loud music  To the point where waitresses and waiters cant hear what we order  Ill give a play by play on this trip  9:58 we are seated  10:00 we order drinks at happy hour  10:13 we get drinks  10:15 she finally realizes we never got menus  10:21 order  Have to repeat one part 4 times between the two of us for her to hear it  10:41 got food  Very rushed and in a hurry 11:01 we finished eating  11:02  Got the bill  Food is good as always  and at least they give you wet naps so you can clean your own table when you sit down  Good food  Poor service as usual,?
1982394,I come here quite often because it is a block away from work  I give 3 stars because the turntable I bought from there fucking RULES!!! And it was very reasonably priced  The vinyl selection is pretty   meh   I am stoked if I find something to take home  They do a great job of showcasing up and coming artists as well as local acts  A if that is what youre into  Its also nice to see some friends band on the shelf  When an artist sticks out and engages my curiosity  it is my luck to find only 2 live recordings in their slot   wah  Dont get me wrong live recordings are DOPE but it is nice to have more of a selection I think Sloth Records does a fantastic job attracting younger crowds & getting the 17th avenue locales excited about vinyl  I keep very optimistic about this place and find myself flipping through stock on a regular basis   what a great way to pass time ,?
1982463,I come here really often since its just 3 minutes from where I live   Good for people with family  Food is average  service is OK  the view is great  A lot of tourists in the summer and could get crowded  Like the dim sum durin lunch hours Good place to go when we have no where else to go ,?
1982678,I come here to buy my restaurant work shoes  They work great and are comfortable  Great customer service from Quinton very helpful and polite,?
1983169,I come here with my sister for the nostalgia factor because we have great memories visiting growing up when this restaurant was in its prime  I dont think the restaurant has received any updates in the last 20 years  I love the Caesar salad dressing and the warm sourdough bread served with garlic butter  We were shocked to see when we visited last week that they sell glasses of wine for $2 50 and half carafes for $5 00  They dont list the types or brands on the menu  does it really matter at that price? Lol just pick red  white  or blush and you can get wine there cheaper than a soda at other restaurants  Get the toasted ravioli for an appetizer and keep in mind when you receive your entree that its typical chain fare  do not expect anything more for the price you are paying  This is a great restaurant for a larger party because most tables seat 6 or more ,?
1983227,I come in every 2 weeks  I swear its a 30 minute wait every    single    time  Always a long line here ,?
1983896,I come to Verve for one reason only  Pooja   I drive all the way from the Ballantyne area to see her as she is the best eyebrow threader I have met in Charlotte   She is very thorough and makes you feel comfortable   Plus she is super nice   A little on the pricey side (eyebrows and lip threading plus tip  $32) but she is worth it ,?
1985368,I consider myself a burger aficionado and this my friends  is the best burger Ive ever had  Ive had burgers all over North America and a few places in Europe  and this beats them all  I can write a very long review describing the incredible taste of each burger here  but simply put  you wont go wrong here  Youll cry when youre done because youll want another one  and youll be too full to have another  Go with the Captain Jerk  thats my favorite P S  I secretly fly to Toronto from LA just for Burgernator ,?
1986307,I contacted Mike and was given an early morning date for a palm tree trim  6 AM   I was up by 4:30 getting ready only to have this firm be a noshow   I called at 6:15 and left a message to call me if they needed help getting directions though Id covered my address in an earlier phone conversation   There was no call back   I found this firm to be unreliable!,?
1986971,I continue to have good experience after good experience at Club Nails   Im somewhat perplexed by some of the reviews written and can only come up with the opinion that you cant please all the people  all the time    Im in a service industry myself so know that often times it is a matter of you get what you give   This shop is very clean  the equipment used is clean and sterile and the service is excellent   I highly recommend Club Nails ,?
1986991,I continue to love this place and the service just keeps getting better  Now if you pay cash they give you an additional 10% off  And they rock with the nail art  My toes have never looked better ,?
1987266,I could describe each delicious morsel of each of the donuts that I tried but I would hate to deprive you of the experience yourself  Here is what you need to know amazing selection (almost too much to choose from  youll want to but a lot)  fantastically tasty donuts and so affordable! We thought that we had been charged incorrectly because our total was so low considering everything that our group purchased  Not so  Ronald just makes super donuts at gear prices  If I lived in Vegas  I would be a regular!,?
1987530,I could even say this is a 3 5 Star restaurant Ive heard so much about Grand Electric and how amazing the tacos are  but while good  I didnt think they were great Baja fish taco  3 5/5Shrimp taco  3 5/5Pork belly taco  4/5Atmosphere  3 5/5  Do not recommend coming here with a large group  Even with 2  I felt rather squishy with the tables next to us  I didnt find noise was a problem  but we came on an early Sunday evening (5pm ish) and there was a snow storm outside which Im guessing deterred some people from going out Service  3/5  Server was kind of hard to flag down when we needed her  but otherwise  service was okay  Nothing else notable Overall  the meal was good but didnt think it was great ,?
1988174,I could not be happier with their service  After contacting many people at not getting any responses I thought I would send a yelp message  They contacted me right away made an appointment to come out  As I am a homeowner that lives in another state communication is always key and he sent me pictures of some extensive repairs that were needed and did the job the same day for a great price  Really quality people and great service   See before and after pictures ,?
1988980,I could spend HOURS and HOURS in this store  They have everything you need or could think of needing for outdoors stuff and then some  The layout of the store is very simple and easy to get around   We love looking at the fishes  The gun department is our favorite section  and those guys know their stuff for sure!,?
1989929,I couldnt believe the poor reviews  so as I live close by I had to come and try this place for myself Nice welcome  seated quickly although quite busy (Friday Lunchtime)  Waitress personable and told us a lot of things about the menu and the pub concept  Im a Guinness fan (understatement) and tried their stout    very  very good!!Ordered Mediterranean chicken salad and my wife had the Philly Poutine  both very good (although my chicken was a little dry) Would recommend to any of my family and friends ,?
1990143,I couldnt find the place  Frustrating  Drove around for a while    GPS indicated that I passed it twice going in both directions  Maybe its underground  Maybe I need magic glasses to be able to see it  If youre in a hurry and have never been here its probably not worth the time it takes for the fruitless detour  Best of luck to you!,?
1990275,I couldnt have asked for a more relaxed and no pressure setting  Denice was my stylist and she was spot on!!!! The dress she picked for me was AMAZING!!!!!!!!! I tried on 5 dresses  all different styles and could not decide   They were all beautiful and perfect! This is the place to go to get a dress! No pressure   no stress   no one checking their watches  The staff made me feel I was the only person there  I wish I could give more than 5 stars!,?
1990347,I couldnt have bothered to review a coffee chain but this one is special as the lovely people behind the counter played 2 of my favourite music from the soundtrack for my favourite movie! I loved listening to them as I was doing my studying  Speaking of studying  this is a brilliant place for that as it is quiet  High school kids dont raid the place in the afternoon  which is a huge plus  Staff is friendly and they make wonderful coffee  Well its the same coffee you can get at thousands of other Starbucks but you know how some stores give you terrible coffee  but this wasnt one of them ,?
1990746,I couldnt wait for Salad and Go to open   I was there on their first day and I have to say  that first salad was a little disappointing   My Chicken Caesar Salad was so salty I could barely eat it and the diet cola  oh my  lets just say its a good thing Im trying to kick the diet soda habit   Anyway  I knew they were a new business and figured Id have to go back and give them another chance  I am SO very glad I did   I ordered the same Chicken Caesar Salad but this time I got the dressing on the side   What a difference; it was delicious!  I will be a forever customer now with my dressing on the side   I am always on the go  always eating fast food so its great to have a healthy alternative ,?
1990891,I count myself a lucky one  I sent 12 medium to large boxes from Springfield  MA to Phoenix  AZ  I expected it to take 23 weeks  They arrived in one week! All boxes were there  Only one of them was mangled  but I take responsibility for not taping it well enough There is no guarantee with Greyhound Package Express  Its a cheap service with generally low customer service  But if you want to take the risk  I say go for it There wasnt anyone at the Package Express desk when I arrived  I waited for about 5 minutes then asked the security guy where the attendant was  He was quite rude  I ended up leaving and returning a few hours later  The ticket attendant went to grab the package express attendant  He was very helpful  I wish I remembered his name  But he was gracious enough to put the boxes in my truck for me on both the trips I had to make Will I use the service again? Depends on the circumstances  but Im not ruling it out ,?
1992197,I decided that since Dutch had such a long line that I would try this place  That was a mistake  The line wasnt even that log and I waited there for 30 minutes  The employee didnt know what milks they offered  I had to search for it on the sign  One person making drinks for 3 different Windows is terrible and they were slow at it as well  I love coffee but not to wait for 20 minutes and I was car number 2  When i got my drink there was hardly any ice in it  I wasnt fete a punch card or guidance on what was good  They have potential but so far not impressed at all,?
1992230,I decided to be a pig today and eat more than I should  This was the first time I tried it and I loved it  I tried the chocolate croissant  hostess cupcake and sticky bun  All wonderful  a little expensive but that wouldnt stop me from going back  The people were very friendly  The only thing I didnt like was there was nothing in the glass case to drool over  but maybe because I got there late in the afternoon   still a great place ,?
1992500,I decided to check this place out because the reviews on Yelp were really good  and The Bagel Man did not disappoint  Im not kidding when I say these are the best bagels Ive ever had  It sounds silly  but theyre seriously so good! You can tell they are made fresh  The service is so nice and genuine  This is the best holeinthewall breakfast place ,?
1992632,I decided to come here because my coworker highly recommended the place & I was glad did   I was celebrating my sons first communion & wanted three small centerpieces   Gale & her staff did an amazing job   I would definitely come back again,?
1993962,I decided to join BBC in January as I jumped on the new year  new me bandwagon with the rest of the world KNOWING I wouldnt stick to it like years passed  Anyway  oddly enough  here I am 4 months later going every single morning  Burn bootcamp has truly changed my life  Yes  I said it   my life! I go work out every single morning (even Saturdays) with no moans and complaints  I wake up anxiously ready for the gym! The workouts are always different and target each part of your body  I have lost weight  toned muscle and can officially say I have my own gym routine! The hours are great for before and after work  They even have early weekend times to jump start your day off! My point? If youre looking for an amazing gym that will make you excited to go everyday   look no more! These guys are top notch!,?
1996483,I definitely recommend em! I have an investment property that had a fridge go out on a tenant and needed service immediately  Came out the same day  gave me a straight forward quote and went straight to business  In and out within two hours  They get the job done quick and efficiently and keep me updated through out the entire process  Now the fridge is working up to par  tenant happy  Im happy  No problems ever since!,?
1996661,I definitely was not expecting a restaurant like this with a name like Protein Source   I was thinking it was going to all about body building and muscle milk   This is just great restaurant that specializes in infusing protein into the meals   The juices and smoothies are very good and brewed in store   They give options to build your own or they have about 15 on the menu to choose from as well   The food is excellent and tasty   Its not the cheapest lunch in town (around $812 for a meal)  but the quality makes it worth the extra few bucks   The food is freshly prepared and the restaurant has a fast casual feel   Their whole menu is customizable so come here and keep trying new things ,?
1996668,I definitely wasnt expecting to eat such great authentic Thai food in Vegas since everytime I come here  I eat at the strip and asian food there is very americanized and overpriced Komol restaurant is off the strip but not too far from the strip   If you are willing to venture out or craving good thai food  definitely try out Komol My favorite there was the Tom Ka soup along with the Tofu curry and the papaya salad   I am usually not a huge fan of Pad Thai since many places make it a little too sweet  but the Pad Thai here was very peanutty and not too sweet!  Probably the best Pad Thai I ever had for my taste :DThe Tom Ka soup and the Tofu curry is pretty spicy but very ver delicious and they go very well with rice   Papaya salad is perfect for cooling down your palette since the food here can get pretty spicy Service wasnt the best  but wasnt too bad as well   Prices are very reasonable :)  I will definitely come back here again!,?
1996690,I definitely wish I wouldve read the reviews before I came here  My check engine light is on  I brought them the codes for what was wrong yet still got charged $110 for labor to figure out the problem  In typical mechanic shop fashion they call over to tell me itll cost over $1700 to fix my problem of faulty oxygen sensors and a leak in the EVAC system  I tell them thats definitely not getting fixed today and they try to get me to sign up for their credit card  Im definitely feeling ripped off right now  I hope that this helps keep someone else from making the same mistake I did ,?
1997851,I did have high expectations because of Tom Collichios name and the fact that I LOVE Craftsteak  but this place was disappointing  The sandwich I had was okay but nothing special  Ive had better sandwiches in Portland ,?
1998394,I did not enjoy this place  all you can eat sushi is NOT worth 27 almost 28 dollars   Our server was nice  but it took so long for the food to come out   We had to tell them several times that we were missing things   I actually dont mind waiting for food as long as it is good  the menu was small  Dessert wasnt even included  Someone on here recommended the fried rice  It tasted old and I waited for over 30 minutes to try it  The food was just ok  Not very fresh  This place isnt horrible  but there are so many other great ayce  in las vegas and this place doesnt stand a chance  I will not be going back ,?
1998947,I did not know what to expect from this place and I was pleasantly surprised with the entire experience  The atmosphere is great  The staff is great  The food is great  I got a barbacoa bowl which I thought was delicious and well seasoned  I also added their signature Hot Head sauce which was great too  As far as fast casual restaurants go  this place is a hit!,?
1999397,I did not think that the food was going to be good  Its in the Epicenter and it was PACKED! I was not going for the partying  I was going for the partaking of good food! I ordered a special and the food came out super quick  Usually thats a bad sign because that means they just plopped something on the plate that was premade and usually stale  It was pretty tasty though  My waiter was nice and patient  The menu was reasonably priced  The drink specials were decent as well  Overall  no complaints ,?
1999708,I did the Grand Canyon West Rim Helicopter Tour  Above and Below the Rim Extended Air Tour  70 Minutes  Absolutely amazing  Hotel pickup to the Boulder air port  easy and convenient  Our pilot Travis who resides locally was awesome  mixing the serious business of flying a helicopter with his own touch of amusing commentary as we flew over his favourite hiking grounds and the astounding geological formations both man made and natural  Travis even threw in some helicopter flying pointers  he was clearly passionate about the area and flying  The Grand Canyon and surrounding area is mind blowing but this flight put it on another level ,?
2000191,I didnt believe the five star at first so I had to go and try it out myself  Its not a big bakery but more on size of a kiosk sized little shop  They dont have much of a variety in desserts except macarons  lattes   other drinks and cream puffs but if those are what you are looking for then this is a great small shop to stop by at  Macaroons are flavourful and rich  I love how the sizes are a tad larger than the typical macaron and the texture is fresh and chewy! Did I mention the owner is quite friendly and she uses fine matcha powder all the way from Uji (place in Japan) :) Oh last but not least  their cream puffs  specifically the matcha cream puffs are to die for! I normally dont like or eat cream puffs but I absolutely love this one and I know when Im craving macaron or cream puffs Ill definitely return here!,?
2000695,I didnt even get to try the food here  The restaurant was completely empty and we were told  needed to wake up our disabled baby to remove her from her stroller because strollers arent allowed  I suggested just pushing her into the corner next to our table  Our waitress with a straight face said someone might get seated at the table next to us IN AN EMPTY RESTAURANT! DISGUSTING,?
2000810,I didnt even know this place existed until my friend held her sons 100 day dinner celebration here  The restaurant is quite big  even with 4 tables of 10 reserved they were still able to accommodate other diners while we were there She had the traditional 10 dish dinner  and all the food came out at a good pace and were really tasty  I took a take out menu with me  along with some suggestions from my girlfriend on dishes shes tried  Ill definitely keep this place in mind the next time Im craving Chinese food ,?
2001563,I didnt go here until October  though Ive walked past here for years  but much to my surprise  its the best Burger king Ive ever been to  You know what youre getting into menuwise for Burger King  but the art work is lighthearted  and the place is open and quiet  which makes a great dining experience for fast food  The food is surprisingly fresh  and nice quality  They even have an electronic menu behind the counter which is entertaining in its own right ,?
2001880,I didnt have high expectations for such an unusual type of fusion food  but I thought SumoMaya was great   We mostly had Mexican cuisine (ceviche  tacos) all of which was excellent I deducted a star for our somewhat pretentious server  who didnt write down our order and then forgot two of our dishes   I reminded him  and then he only brought one of them  then had our table cleared and asked if we wanted dessert We said no  and as he was walking away  a waiter walked towards our table with our salad (the missing dish)   Our server whispered in his ear and sent him away   Did he really think we didnt notice/forgot?  The right thing to do would have been to apologize and ask if we still wanted the dish   Some maturity and grace  rather than trying to save face  would have gone much farther ,?
2002559,I didnt know what to expect as we decided to eat here after seeing the lineup of the the place we wanted to go best decision ever! Its freaking $7 99 for unlimited noodlessoup and 11 free toppings  If you want to add premium toppings its $1 99 extra for a fair amount  I tried two of the soup bases  spicy and sour  spicy pickled pepper  I recommend the spicy and sources the pickled pepper didnt have much flavour  just spice  The servers explained the menu and answered all of our questions  and at the end of our meal they took the effort to thank and greet us in Vietnamese (they were Chinese or Korean),?
2002622,I didnt know what to expect going here  The sandwiches are great  I would eat here all the time if I lived around here  The meatball sandwich and the sausage were outstanding  I think I will eat there again while staying in Phoenix ,?
2002887,I didnt like the burritos  they dont even come with beans and rice! Its just meat!!! I asked if they can put beans and rice he said yes they can which they charged me extra for it  I got home and none of the burritos I bought have beans or rice!! Never going back there again!,?
2003817,I didnt stay at this hotel but my brother  his wife and kids did  The suite they stayed in was pretty nice  Pretty spacious  clean and comfy with a nice view of the pool area  The pool area was also another nice thing about this hotel  they have four big ones  one was even heated and a couple of hot tubs  My brother and I tried out their new Zipline  it was fun but not intense and I guess a little expensive for a minute ride but it did give you a nice view This is a pretty nice hotel  fair price and I would considering staying here next time ,?
2004817,I dig Jersey Mikes  I just always seem to get stuck behind the person ordering 35 sandwiches for their entire office  Why not call a big order like that in ahead of time or order it on line so I do t have to stand in line for 25 minutes listening to you yay or nay every ingredient for all 200 sandwiches  It puts all the employees in the weeds and causes a line out the door behind you ,?
2005027,I dig this place   Youd think it would be louder on the patio since it is so close to the road but the trees and walls make it feel more peaceful   I walked in the door and the staff was very engaging and friendly   Grabbed a coffee and went out on the patio to work for an hour or so on solid wifi   I think this will be getting into my regular rotation  so I plan to update more as I try pastries / espresso etc ,?
2006936,I dislike Pauls Club quite a bit   The service staff is beyond rude   Their drinks are fairly cheap  but the service staff is working with their nose stuck up in the air   A friend was there chilling with another friend just having some drinks  and then the bartender starts threatening to kick them out for looking at the crowd   They were TOLD to face forward at the bar   If Im going to go to a bar to have a few drinks and people watch  whats it to the bartender?  Ive also heard numerous stories about them screwing up the checks with overcharging and what not   Its a pretty shoddy business ,?
2007753,I do like the facility here   Its very big with a large staff and very easy to get an appointment   Theyve even been accommodating to me as a walkin when I first got my concussion   I was seen within a half hour and I didnt have an appointment   I definitely cant complain about that   Youre able to make an appointment online (or at least make the request for the appointment)  which is convenient   Theres a pharmacy on premises  which is always helpful when you dont want to make a second trip   The only reason this is not a 5star is because before I moved  my PCP was a oneman practice   Its hard to get used to being one of hundreds of patients and not really getting a connection to a single doctor the way you can with a small practice   Ive been trying to see the same doctor (Kimberly Brabentz) and she is really good ,?
2007775,I do like the food here  Some servers are very nice  some are clueless  The lunch buffet is strange  You have to order your wings anyhow they arent on the buffet  Kinda makes that pointless   Strange procedure for gift cards at Christmas time  If you are seating and eating  they wont just put the cards on your bill  They make you get in line like the people who walk in just to buy cards that are not even dining in  That is kinda rude  I am your dining guest  I should be getting service  Aside from oddities like that the food is good  I do like the warm wet wipes!!,?
2008172,I do love their rotisserie chicken the most   I am not a huge fan of all of the sides   I also do a lot of catering here for work lunches and they do a really great job at that   Good option for fast  non fast food  just watch out for the sides   ,?
2008464,I do not drink a lot of coffee any more   My friend Arlin B recommended this place and it is next door to the post office where I drop my Netflix rentals   No matter when you go in the staff is very friendly and the place just smells good   While I have had Kona coffees I prefer (notably of late at Hulas) I have chosen the Molokai blend here as my favorite ,?
2008539,I do not even want to give them one star  I lived there for two years and recommended my friends to them  However  when I moved out  they took all the deposit away ($1650) and asked us to pay $200 more only because there was a little fixable damage on the carpet  They asked to replace all the carpet  That is RIDICULOUS! The manager did not reply the email for the concern about the carpet replace and through a bill to me directly  DO NOT MOVE IN! OTHERWISE YOU WILL GOT YOUR MONEY LOST!,?
2008817,I do not know how this place isnt booming with business  First off: the staff is so friendly  I swear we were greated by everyone who was working  They were happy and pleasent  Great with my friends kids as well  Second off: their food is CHEAP  We paid about 9 dollars for a 4 course meal  Soup and salad bar  Dessert and an entree! Most importantly though: the food  One of the best meals I have eaten in a LONG time  I seriously cannot get over how good the food was  You cannot beat this quality of food at the price  The soup is homemade everyday  I couldve eaten just soup and left happy  The salad bar doesnt have as many toppings as most other places  but everything was fresh! I will recommend this place to everyone that I meet  It was fantastic!,?
2009349,I do not reccommend   There were multiple good reviews online for the Kenmore products   When I recieved mone there was water leaking on the floor and I was told a repair person would come out in a week and that they would call me thw night before    As an employed adult I cant take a second day off work to wait for aomeone who should have hooked up the fridge correctly the first time     When I then called the Ros Park Store where I bought it I was told there is nothing that they can do   All I want is a service tech to fix my refridgerator without me taking off another day of work  and it ruining my new wood floors ,?
2009467,I do not recommend that place  they are very unpunctual  they do not let you enter with your minor child  there is no kindness with the patients  there they treat us as if we were numbers  and not patients  and they look like robots   they all have faces of embittered  and they act as if they are the last coke in the party  The only kind one is to the latin lady in reception  the others are people talk without any kindness  on arrival it smelled like pure marijuana  horrible place  They look at us in a very cold way  its a place that I do not recommend at all The made an error on an appointment with my daughters  I took them to there appointment and there was only an appointment for one  although they knew they made an error  they didnt give me the absent note for the school  because the main doctor just didnt want to  They dont deserve even ONE point ,?
2009671,I do not recommend this place   I previously went to another place across the street  Would cost me 38 00 for a fill gel polish  This place opened at cost 43 00  The people were great   Worth the extra 5 00   i have had the same thing done  same polish  same fade  everytime i went   For some reason today it was 55 00   again   i did nothing different  Actually today I didnt have the added glitter    They do a good job  but so does the place across the street   nothing makes them worth 20 00 more   I wont go back    Sad cause they have great people  minus the one girl thats normally up front ,?
2011134,I dont care that this place is in the Excalibur and you have to find your way through the smoke filled casino to get there  once youre inside you have no idea what is going on outside the red walls of this place   Food is always consistent  good and hot!  Huge portions made for sharing  and be careful ordering anything LARGE there  they mean it   On a business trip so could not take home the left over pasta  too bad it was good   Service was good  never waited for anything   Im glad I finally found people to go with to this place  its no a place one person could eat alone without exploding!  Love it for the great food and service!  Wish it wasnt inside the Excalibur but its fun to see the old place every so often ,?
2012158,I dont eat red meat  so I had to go with chicken which was cooked to perfection and the size was very generous  The atmosphere is awesome  little cute family owned place  worth to try ,?
2013081,I dont even like pancakes and theirs were so good  The waffle was mmmmm   The biscuits and gravy are pretty good  The eggs Benedict were really good   No I did not eat all in one sitting I have been there multiple times and will be going back in the future ,?
2015174,I dont give 5 starts often but this place def deserves it  I would come here again tomorrow if I could We had brunch here  highly recommended  Lots of unique cocktails and the menu has lots to choose from  They are know for their fried chicken  its brined for like 27 days and a taste amazing Food: we had the deviled eggs as they were recommended by the waiter  best I have ever had  We then split the chicken and waffle meal  best fried chicken we have ever had and even the waffle was amazing  Banana puddling also really good Great atmosphere  waiter very friendly and gave great recommendations Highly recommended place  We will come back next time we are in Vegas ,?
2015230,I dont give five stars often  This one deserves it not necessarily for the taste of the food  which was excellent  but for the creativeness! Cow fish? Exactly  beef and sushi  not just on the place  but combined in the sushi! I only wish this was in my area  If I am ever back in Charlotte  I WILL return  Dont let the descriptions scare you off  Try it  youll LOVE it!,?
2016195,I dont have health insurance so I had to pay for my dental services  I thought the prices was okay after comparing it with other dental centers in the area  And plus they had an internet coupon for $100 off  So thats why I went with them instead of another dental center  Plus there were a number of good reviews on google for Biltmore Commons Dental Care  That gave me more confidence to use their services   I called at 8am and I was able to get an appointment at 9am  Maybe I was lucky or maybe theres vacant spots because of the bad economy and no one is going the dentist  Who knows  Dr  Balestrino did my fillings  He took his time to explain to me what needed to be done and addressed the questions I had  I am overall pleased with this dentist visit  I would go back for my follow up in six months to get my teeth cleaned ,?
2016386,I dont have much to say  I love their food! It is a pricey place  but like the saying goes  You get what you pay  I definitely suggest everyone who likes steak  must try their food at least once ,?
2016639,I dont know a lot places that dedicate their entire menu to different types of desserts so I cant really compare this place with any other  I have to say that if you are just aching for something sweet  this is the place to fill the void There really is no way you can wrong with cakeice cream or cakecoffee or waffleschocolate or any other sweet combination you can think of  That being said  I wouldnt necessarily say that this place has the best cake  or the best coffee  or the best ice cream  they just have a place that puts all these things together into one complete dessert shop ,?
2016800,I dont know about the other reviews  But my transaction went pretty smooth  The lady in there explained everything pretty well  As for the price  Yeah  a little on the expensive side but the quality is higher than avg  And I like high quality for the things worth framing ,?
2017215,I dont know how Ive missed out on this place for so long  Friends of mine have been going for years  and I dont eat hot dogs usually  but decided I would go and try their veggie dogs  which are measly in size to the real hot dogs  but whatever  I got two veggie dogs fully loaded polish style  and they were so  good  Also  their onion rings make me so happy  Not overly greasy  just plain good  Get yourself a lingonberry shake! It tastes like the best strawberry shake youve never made ,?
2017534,I dont know how people eat this food  It is worst than Panda Express and over priced  They need to make some changes ,?
2019216,I dont know that alot of folks are aware that they have a pool area with cabanas that can be rented that offer a nice view of the golf bays  but Im glad that I researched online and found out   The cabana reservation we had  for a group of 10  only cost a $250 spend minimum on food and beverage  which we were able to meet that very easily   The pool itself it about 36 deep throughout  so dont worry if you can swim  you can walk around with no problem   The wait staff were very friendly and accommodating  we ordered a bunch of different foods and everything was great: Chicken Nachos  Steak Nachos  Steak on a Stick  BBQ Wings  Hot Wings  and more   My drink of choice was the Patron Margaritashort and it was very nice on the tequila to filler ratio   We didnt play the golf bays on this visit  but my friends and I agreed we would definitely visit here again ,?
2019796,I dont know what happened to this location because it used to be great  but my last few orders have been a lot less flavorful than they used to be  My friends have noticed this as well  Feels like theyre skimping on their sauce :( used to go all the time but probably wont be back,?
2021491,I dont know where to start  This has to be the WORST BBQ place I have EVER eaten at in my life  The mac and cheese was horrible  The green beans had no taste and the meat was   there isnt even a word to describe how bad it was  I usually read reviews before I go to places  but I figured how bad could it be  Let me tell you I wont ever make that mistake again  No wonder this place is always empty  Whoever is cooking that food needs to be fired ASAP! This place needs new management and new employees quick    fast and in a hurry  If they dont make some serious changes this place will close down  Lord I cant believe I just wasted my money ,?
2021597,I dont know who Honey Bun is but I love their buns and boba! They now accept credit cards with purchases $10 or over  I highly recommend the Spicy Kimchi Bun and any boba milk tea or smoothie ,?
2022733,I dont know why people love this place so much  The waits are always long  The food is average (bruschetta is so soggy! Ugh!)  The location is premier so I can see the appeal of that  I did have a great holiday party there one year with good service (still bad food!)  But other times service has been slow  Overall  low rating from me  Two stars is because they do have a decent happy hour ,?
2023103,I dont know why this location gets inconsistent reviews  I love this Panda store  I have been a regular customer for over two years  3 times a week  I am always greeted when I walk in and they dont hesitate to cook fresh food if I dont like what I see The managers have all been great  I just wish one would stay a little longer  Diana is super nice and so is Rae  I think its a hidden gem  its rarely crowded like the others and I get extras from time to time ,?
2024432,I dont like this Starbucks at all  I only come here because of the distance and often leave wishing Id just gone a little further instead  Baristas have little knowledge about their specials or deals and are very huffy when remaking drinks that the cashier didnt mark correctly on the cup  Now  Im not someone who asks for a million modifications to a menu item  In fact  I get a simple coffee with syrup or light/no ice if I know Im going to be in the car a while   For whatever reason  my order is completely baffling and I usually need my drink remade every other time I come in  However  the baristas have always seemed to be in a decent mood overall and handle having a line to the door and their drive thru very well  That deserves a star  however  thats pretty much a mandatory quality   If you can  make your coffee at home or swing around the corner to Peets  or simply choose another Starbucks ,?
2025294,I dont mind paying a lot of money for good food  However  I do mind overpriced bad food  If I have to pay over $16 for a hamburger n fries it should be more than lukewarm n the meat should b mediumwell (as I ordered) not charred ,?
2025649,I dont normally go into this store because their style hasnt immediately gripped me on the occasions I have been in there  However I decided to just check it out and see what they have today  Unfortunately I decided to ask the saleslady about the content of a pillow whether it was cotton or linen  Her answer to me was to avoid answering the question and to reply to my other question about whether this was for the winter season by telling me  I know you want to know because you want to know whether it is on sale  I dont know when this sort of customer service has become normal  But I dont think Ill be coming back to this store to shop anytime soon ,?
2025828,I dont normally post reviews on Yelp   In fact  this is my first one   But I had to come on here and say how great of an experience my wife and I had for my 40th birthday   My wife surprised me by having Presidential Limo pick us up at the airport   Anthony Ray was our driver and I cant say enough how awesome he was   Professional  courteous  funny   top notch!  He took us around town  stopped off at a liquor store on the way to our hotel  even came in and shopped with/for us   It was incredible   Had a bottle of champagne waiting for us in the car   His customer service is unbeatable   Were going back to Vegas in February for my sister in laws 21st birthday and you best believe we will be requesting Anthony to be our driver again   A lot of drivers just merely do their job;  Anthony goes above and beyond and I appreciate that   Cant go wrong with Anthony at Presidential Limo   Great service all around ,?
2026246,I dont often eat at Triple 7 because Im partial to the other restaurants within the Boyd properties  but every now and then a bit of sushi or some greasy bar food does the trick On this last visit  I opted for the former and consumed some oysters  a large mixed sashimi plate and a giant hamachi kama   Truth be told  the fish isnt the finest quality Ive ever eaten  but its pretty darn good for an offering at a brew pub   Finesse is lacking  but I cant complain about the portions or the service ,?
2027946,I dont remember the name of the guy who cut my hair but I spoke to who I think was the owner and he told be for my type of hair the person he set me up with was the best  It costed me 40$ for the combo pack which was a hair cut and to fix up my beard I had an option to complete remove but I felt like keeping it   I found he did a great job my friends and family saw it and I was told it was the best I ever gotten   I would defiantly come back just wish it was just a little cheaper but hey I was satisfied with the end result   If I took the time to review a barber place then I think its worth a try  One more thing to keep in mind is to call or go online to see if they are booked if you just walk in from what Ive seen you wont be getting an appointment the same day ,?
2028261,I dont see what all the good reviews are about  No taste pizza  high cost small soda $2 50  self order  You have to go up to the bar to order what you want  No one tells you though  We sat at the table 20 minutes  menu in hand the server walked by menu times and never said a word  The music was so loud  There was a table of very loud obnoxious people at the table next to us  it really made the visit excruciating  The tables are very close to each other  Guy Fieri got this one wrong ,?
2028309,I dont see what the big deal is  When I went the soda machine was broken  and the food was bland  Didnt really think the fries were anything to care about  Very subpar  and more over  just because they give you all you can eat  free peanuts  doesnt mean you should pay so much for a burger or hot dog  Not worth the money  not worth the trip in my opinion  Wouldnt return  wouldnt recommend ,?
2028380,I dont see why people bash this place  Theyve got to be some of the friendliest and most eager lounge staff Ive ever met  The front desk lady remembered my name on a subsequent visit! They have a beautiful corner location in the terminal  great for plane spotting  The food offerings arent the most exciting for a lounge  but theyre adequate  Yes  the restroom is public and its outside the lounge but its on the 2nd floor of the airport so only people using the lounge or the conference room next would use it  The Club is open 8am3:30pm for Priority Pass  and after 3:30pm its exclusively a British Airways lounge (the food offerings noticeably improve after then with a nice spread of sandwiches  fresh veggies and soups)  although if you check in before 3:30pm theyll let you stay until the British Airways flight boards (~7pm)  My only complaint is that you cant check in after 3:30pm!,?
2029995,I dont think we need another review of this wonderful little eatery  All thats been said is all that needed to be said about how good the pizza is and how the price may need adjustment  So heres some tips while eating there Mondays are half off pizza for dinein all day  For dinner: go early or bring patience  The wait can get pretty long  Lunch was not as packed but you never know on Mondays said our waitress If you are up for an appetizer  their Bosco CheeseFilled Breadsticks is a must have! Yep  gooey cheese encased by nice tasting bread with savory marinara dipping sauce Oh yeah  if you are lactose intolerant like me  you need to medicated before dining  ,?
2030568,I dont understand how anyone could leave a bad review  This is going to be our new breakfast hangout  Rachel our server was very friendly  We had the waffle dog   French toast  and the Wolfpack  All three were delish  we will definitely be back  If your a piece picky eater like me this is your place ,?
2030940,I dont understand the bad reviews   This place is awesome   My wife and I had dinner and drinks this past Saturday on the patio  Staff was attentive and very friendly   The food was excellent  we ordered from the tapas menu   My wife ordered a creamscicle mixed drink and I had a glass of Black Stallion Cabernet   Her drink was made perfectly and the wine is NOT marked up horribly here  like at most restaurants   The food prices were also outstanding  I highly recommend this place   Great food  drinks  prices and scenery   You cant ask for more ,?
2031297,I dont understand the point of making an appointment when you have to wait more than 30 minutes past your appointment time to simply drop of the phone for a cracked screen repair   I dont need a complex consultation  Very frustrated,?
2031704,I dont understand why people wait for this lousy pizza   Ordered half mushoom/pepperoni   I swear the mushrooms were from a can and hardly any pepperoni   I personally have eaten better pizza from a box   It used to be better   but not anymore   I have banned this restaurant ,?
2031961,I dont understand why this place is over rate  The is just OK nothing special! People is not friendly here ,?
2032057,I dont use beads in the traditional way  I use then in my knitting and crochet projects  This has never been an issue here  First of all  if you need beads they have them! Big  small  all different shapes and beautiful colors! It can be a bit overwhelming if you dont know what you are looking for  but the staff here is great at helping you find just what you need  Ive purchased my beads from Crystal Bead Bazaar three time now and I plan to be back many more times ,?
2033354,I dont want a vulture  but Id like to at least be acknowledged! I was here for around twenty minutes and no one approached me I walked the lot and even went on the show room floor  its like I was given the cold shoulder  There were salespeople everywhere not one seemed to want to sell me anything ,?
2033734,I dont where to start with this  I wish there was more of these in L A  The Ultimate Feast  is the best  I love the cheesy biscuits  The food was always on point and it just was the best seafood Ive had in awhile  Not to mention it was always so fresh!  I was never able to get a picture of my food before devouring it but it was good  and for the amount of food you get the Ultimate Feasts price was well worth it!,?
2033991,I dont write reviews much  although I should  because this place deserves a great review  Weve been in the valley a few years  tried many places  NONE of them as good as this one  Great food  great service  fast delivery  some of the best crab rangoon youll ever try  Good NYC style Chinese ,?
2035159,I doubt all the 5 star reviews are genuine    I think those might be written by their own employees     its absolutely correct they scratch the car and God knows what kind of cheap and harsh chemical they use it chipped paint off of 2 places on my Mercedes besides numerous clear coat scratches     ,?
2036607,I dropped a shitton of dough at this place and am glad that I did! Everything Ive purchased from here has been of great quality  the place is huge  offering just about everything they possibly can  and the sales people are abundantly available and adequately knowledgeable  One of the best Home Depot locations Ive been to ,?
2037303,I dropped my work IPad and shattered the screen  I needed it fixed fast and luckily had seen this place  The staff was awesome and super friendly  They had my IPad fixed first thing the next day! (I didnt drop it off until almost closing)  It looks brand new and it was $50 cheaper than the Apple Store! I will definitely be using them from now on and sending all my contacts there! Great place!!,?
2038820,I eat all all of the IQ locations all the time before/during/after work and its really expensive but I enjoy pretty much everything Ive tried  fresh ingredients in inventive combinations with frequently delicious sauces  Dont get too creative in your bowl customizations or your lunch is going to set you back approximately 8 billion dollars  Try ordering advance on Ritual  speeds things up and makes the ingredient replacement game less confusing  The crack cups/squares (healthy fats peanut butter cup type things) are reallll good ,?
2040353,I eat here weekly if not once every 2 weeks  The photos on yelp was not flattering but I decided to give it a try and this has become one of my favorite restaurants  The orange and sesame chicken is the best dishes by far  Dont rely on the reviews with this one  Try it out  Only negative no online menu so you will have to make a trip and order and grab a few menus to take home  The wait time has always been less than 1520mins ,?
2040733,I echo the comments of George G   Tokyo Japanese is a real gem   Dont let the strip mall in which this place is located turn you way   The atmosphere is quiet  but not dead; the service is very good; the food is very good; and Stacy is alot of fun   The food is an excellent deal even before you consider the free edamame  miso soup  ice cream  corn and cheese dish  and grilled mushrooms!My fiance and I were looking for a good sushi restaurant without alot of pomp  glitter  and noise  and thats exactly what we got   along with a very good deal   Well definitely eat at Tokyo Japanese again!,?
2041205,I ended up calling  Nail zone for an appt due to my usual nail place lady being  out sick   They got me in same day and even though I ended up being late  they were still very nice and accomodating!! Sorry guys wont happen again  Lol anyway  I love this place  Joey did my pink and whites & he knows what I like without me telling him   that comes from a lot of experience  The guy that did my toes  didnt ask what his name was but he looked young like still in high school  he did an awesome job though! Everything is just right here   glad I found this place!! Joey and everyone at Nail Zone you guys are the best thank you!!!,?
2042964,I enjoy the Movies  I go ALL the time and when I say they have nice comfy seats  I mean it  Nice comfy seats with the armrest that move out of the way if need be ,?
2043205,I enjoy the movies shown at Park Terrace   In addition  I have never experienced any issues with the audience members (cell phones  etc )   Some of the auditoriums are small  which is occasionally appropriate for some of the movies   Great job to the theater and its staff!,?
2043237,I enjoy the relaxing mani/pedi I receive here Gina is very attentive and thorough   Thank you for always making me feel like a million bucks ! See you in two weeks!,?
2043384,I enjoy their thin crust pizza  The sauce has a spicy taste  Not the best pizza  but I havent found any great pizza in Las Vegas  I hope they find a new garlic knot recipe   yuck  I did enjoy the new dining area  plenty of TVs  They are close to where I live   so for now Rosatis will do ,?
2043653,I enjoy this place  Ive been twice on a Groupon deal  The service is a little slow  but the food is good and thats what will keep me coming back  Nice atmosphere  Clean bathrooms  Excellent place to meet up with friends or date night ,?
2044176,I enjoyed checking out Brunos Taco Bar  I ordered the chicken taco and the pineapple salsa on it was amazing  Service was great  Plenty of tables and chair  Would definitely come here again  A,?
2044348,I enjoyed getting my hair done with Felisha at Whitehouse salon  I went in for cut and color  She did the color very well I love the look  She also said I could go without a cut and come back so appreciate that honest feedback  I will be going back to her!,?
2044501,I enjoyed my 2 nights in this lovely hotel  The room is cute and clean  the bed is good  and the washroom is newly renovated ,?
2044835,I enjoyed my ice cream experience at Sweet Jesus! Even if the notoriety is overrated!!! The toppings are good but the ice cream itself is pretty regular  Must taste once ,?
2044926,I enjoyed my meal here  but none of the dishes we had were mind blowing WE ATE: artic char ceviche (4/5): While seriously fresh and unique  the flavors were overpowering the fish duck lamb dumplings (2/5): While the meat was cooked well  the dumpling was greasy and flavourless Banana leaf steamed mackerel (2/5): Nothing that I couldnt have made at home! Taro friends (5/5): YUMMY  GIVE ME MORE  Sticky pork ribs (3/5): My friend seemed to love them  I had a small bite and found them ok I loved the atmosphere at this place so I am willing to give it another try!,?
2045022,I enjoyed my second visit to this place  Their ramen in broth is filled with meat and plenty of flavor ,?
2045220,I enjoyed my time sipping a cold glass of chardonnay on their patio  And  I was able to bring my dog on the patio  which was an added bonus  Happy hour prices should make this a goto place if you live in the area I wasnt as enthused by the food  We ordered a turkey sandwich and everything about it was so  so Phoenix: as in dry  Dry bread  dry turkey  Not enough cream cheese to give it any flavor One sandwich is probably not enough data to draw any conclusions about their full food offering  If you invite me back  Ill gladly go and try something else! I think the laidback vibe here with the amazinglypleasant servers is also a huge draw to the Main Ingredient  So much so that Ill be back for another happy hour on the patio!,?
2045499,I enjoyed staying here  The rooms are nice and modern  There are plenty of great restaurants and bars in the hotel  They even have their own club here too  The downside is this place is so huge it can take a while to get from your room to anywhere you want to be  Its on the south end of the strip so the location isnt the best but the amenities and room quality here make up for it ,?
2046581,I enjoyed this place  but wasnt completely wowed   I was told that its Portuguese  but Im not seeing whats so Portuguese about it   Certainly a good Continental restaurant  by any means   I liked the atmosphere  and the service was good   And the food was good too   But for the price  I didnt think the food was THAT great   Ill come again  but it wont be because Im the one suggesting it ,?
2046584,I enjoyed this place  it was a little overpriced at $16 for the Longhorn BurgerBurger  Beef Brisket  Whiskey BBQ Sauce  Pickle) but its Vegas strip prices  The brisket was an interesting addition to the burger and Id recommend this  I had it with the steak fries and enjoyed the crispy and seasoned fries  They serve you an interesting vinegar and butter popcorn while you wait for your food  One thing Id recommend they do is allow you to create your own burger using more of their toppings from various unique burgers  Id come back again and would also try one of their shakes next time ,?
2046891,I entered a sweepstakes to win Anderson windows  This is what my call log looks like now  I do need two new windows and a French dooryou can bet that after all this harassment Ill be buying them from Pella ,?
2047091,I expect more from a $21 sandwich   Dry bun over cooked pork    Marginal at best    Name aint worth it ,?
2047641,I expected this place to be super fancy and taste like diet food  I was surprised that the atmosphere was very relaxed  (our server had Lavender hair and jeans) I ordered a White Pizza  but with red sauce since I HATE ricotta  I also eat a delicious salad with pomegranate dressing  Nothing blew me away flavorwise  but because I was meeting a friend and we usually talk for hours upon hours  its important that we find a place where we can be left alone to catch up and not be rushed  We dined on a Monday so there was a small lunch rush  but after that it was very quiet  This is a place to just chill and eat healthy without feeling like you are ,?
2047949,I fin love monicals   Perhaps because I was indoctrinated into loving this pizza as a small child   However  when I come home to visit I often find myself wanting to come here and stuff my face   Cheese pizza  topped with their red dressing   so wrong  but oh so right ,?
2048285,I feel as righteous about my Cheesesteaks as I do about Bagels  Forefathers has the most awesome Cheesesteaks this side of the Mississippi  The bread was perfect  The steak flavorful and cooked to perfection (read: not dry)  I use to tell everyone that Uncle Sams had the best Cheesesteaks around  Sorry Uncle Sams  this place has you beat hands down  the most genuine you can find outside of South Street in Philadelphia  The regular is a perfect size unless you are really really really really really (you get the picture) hungry  Youve got to stop in and try this place out! I hope they open a few more locations! (South Phoenix would be great  hint  hint) ,?
2048790,I feel compelled to write them a wonderful review As a woman I hate Any car issues and dealing with car problems I had my oil change done faster than a manicure (its true I went to get a mani and they were done before I painted my nails)not only that they added pressure to my tires without me asking Wonderful service & I would not go anywhere else,?
2049933,I feel like if I come back for food and a latte sometime I will be able to come back and give a more accurate  updated review  But the great atmosphere and service gave me enough to review for now! First off  the barista was incredibly nice and friendly  Also super down to earth  didnt seem fake like people working in those type of positions sometimes seem  She gave us some recommendations and stuff The best part was most definitely the atmosphere! Was cool to be able to see the little lake outside of the window  Good music was playing  I could see puppies outside  all positives! I also liked the succulents and lights and stuff outside  It was very neat I absolutely love tea  so when I saw pomegranate green tea on the menu  I was super excited  Unfortunately the tea did not have even a hint of pomegranate flavor  Ill have to come back for a latte instead  since they roast their own coffee and everything!,?
2050354,I feel like this is Vegasbest kept secret as far as hotels go  Im local and sometimes Ill book a night or two here to relax  On an off night Ive gotten rooms as low as $50 and its a full apartment suite with a jetted soaking tub and full kitchen  Its also quiet since its a little of the beaten path and free casket is nice too  The only downer is the long walk from the fun at Palms ,?
2050537,I feel like this review might hurt my chances of getting conveniently booked  but the guy deserves it Scot is the friendliest  most helpful bike mechanic Ive met so far   Hell answer all your moto questions  then explain what he needs to do with your bike and even how its done   When he pulled up in his big red truck  his copilot surveyed the scene  and Scot wasted no time getting to work  The end result was as good as  if not better  than what Ive spent almost double for at a good (read: busy) shop that takes a week or more for the same work  and he was done in less than 4 hours!,?
2050539,I feel like this ruined all other ice cream for me! It was sooo good  Very creamy  You have 4 options for milk type  which is nice  Then you pick your flavor of ice cream and any toppings  I loved it  The only drawback is it does take awhile so be prepared for that ,?
2053656,I finally did it  I asked my girlfriend to marry me  Right before that  I went to Jareds  haha  Eric was great  calmed me down and though I didnt tell him what I was looking at on the Internet  I told him my price range and   no kidding   the first ring he pulled out was the one i was checking out online  He was very helpful and patient and didnt push a sale ,?
2054503,I finally got to come in for flight night last Friday  It was $15 for 3 glasses of wine! At first I thought it was just going to be smaller pours but nope  these were the real deal FULL pours of wine! We also ordered the scotch egg which was AMAZING  I think this is the best scotch egg Ive ever had and definitely the best one in town! We also ordered a cheese board  I meant to get the meat and cheese board but the girl asked me if I wanted the half size which I went with  turns out the half size is just cheese  Really great cheese though! Lots of crazy things that I cant identify   one had fruit in it  another one was all black and marbled    Great place to chill and hang out  We also stopped in last Thursday for free wine tasting which they do from time to time and Metropolis was playing on tv    so cool!,?
2054609,I finally got to try Charcut in a sitdown setting  We went Monday night for a mommaandsonny dinner out  Apparently it was not a busy night but there were still groups of people dining when we strolled in I had the thanksgiving special which consisted of sausage and arugula as a starter  a roast turkey and stuffing with gravy  and pumpkin cheesecake for dessert  My mom had the fish and tried the bone marrow/escargot appetizer  The meal was great and despite having heard about the serving sizes  I was pretty full Connie was nice enough to come by and say hello  Glad to know how dedicated she is to the restauranthaving to wake up early everyday to pick the ingredients and drafting a unique menu for the day!also does anyone know if theres a Bollywood film being shot in Calgary? Because there was a hot shot crew sitting beside us talking about hair and makeup in the morning  I could have sworn Frida Pinto was having dinner beside us  at least her close look alike!,?
2056705,I find it weird that I would review a gas station since its only gas  but this station has the Oil & Lube  Car Wash and Smog Services  I usually come here every year to get my smog checks done  they are fast :) Its usually 19 95 for your smog test if you pass  and I believe its like 13 95 if you fail  Thankfully ive never failed a smog check  I usually go in the mornings  since the smog service opens at 7:30a  and it usually only takes five minutes!!!,?
2056799,I find myself craving this pizza about 3 to 4 times a week  Its become a staple in my household  My one year old son even loves it! Really you need to try it to become a Novanta believer! Hands down the best pizza place Im Madison  A true Napoli style pizza parlor ,?
2057105,I find the food to be tasty  but have noticed a significant decline in service and speed over the last several weeks   Too bad  will need to go elsewhere ,?
2057377,I find this place to be extremely overpriced when compared to other places (Sescolite  Union Lighting  etc) Ive dropped in on numerous occasions and looked around and have only purchased one item   I usually get the same thing elsewhere at a much cheaper price The showroom is well laid out and it showcases their wares     but when working within a budget  there are better places to shop ,?
2057578,I first became aware of Lees Sandwiches about a year ago in San Jose  California  This one is a little different then the one in San Jose  And cant put my finger on it but it may be that Las Vegas is more culturally designed for tourist  Therefore it may carry over to the culture of the store  Not sure  From what I see there are plenty of Asian patrons though coming into the store  Lees offers free wifi and is open 24hrs  There are also miscellaneous snack products on the floor shelves  The items are those specific Asian type snacks  (You the Americanized Asian sweats ) As for purchase today  wonderful  The Pate Chaud was fresh and the iced coffee consistent as to the San Jose store  Nice and strong ,?
2057685,I first came here after another nail salon completely butchered my nails the day before my wedding!  I came in practically in tears  they took care of my disaster and saved my wedding nails  and didnt even charge me!  They were so wonderful and understanding and I appreciated what they did for me beyond words  I promised to return after that experience  and Im so glad that I did  I saw Tom for a fill with SNS  he was actually able to remove my fake tips and strengthen my nails enough for me to be able to just have natural nails!!  Something I havent been able to do in almost 5 years  He was so friendly and did an amazing job  my nails look better than ever  I provided photos of the before and after of my wedding nails they fixed as well as my recent fill  I wont be going anywhere else from now on!,?
2058700,I first knew this place as furama years and years ago  To this day  my family still calls it that even though it has changed names 2/3x  I assumed they changed owners when the names changed but they must have kept the same workersat least in the kitchen because the food has always tasted the same to us and has been consistently good Its right next to our church and was our goto for special occasions esp when that particular celebration was on a Sunday I dont live in Toronto anymore but I try to make it here every time Im in town ,?
2059170,I first started going to Dr  Hall about a year ago  I must say he is a very talented man  I tried filler and botox both for the first time with him and absolutely love it! It looks so natural and no one would ever even guess Ive had anything done  I also recently did a lipo consulation and he made the whole process a piece of cake  Now  i just need to find the time  Im looking forward to the surgery in the near future!,?
2060201,I flew in from Denver today to see some old friends that live in Scottsdale  They told me to meet them at their fave spot  The Herb Box  and while I was hesitant to oblige (I am on vacation and wanted some comfort food)  Im so glad I did!! The ambiance was fantastic  it was the perfect amount of cool for this Colorado mountain girl on a ridiculously hot Arizona day  I went with a chilled avocado chopped salad that blew my mind  Topped it off with a cool vegan chocolate coconut pudding  Holy cow  Im only here for the weekend  but you bet Ill be back for more! So many things I want to try! The service was excellent to boot!,?
2060890,I followed some amazing Yelp reviews here in need of a bouquet the same day on a students budget  Ken was so fantastic he built a gorgeous bouquet taking into account my budget and flower preferences and made excellent suggestions  It came together really beautifully  I will be coming back!,?
2060911,I followed the owner here from his last salon  His new staff is all very nice and welcoming  The new location looks even better than the last! Very clean and modern  Jimmy always does a great job on my nails and I will definitely be back every few weeks!,?
2061169,I forgot my lunch at home on a school day  so my boyfriend was sweet enough to order me lunch from Makers and Finders  He had come to this cafe once prior and recommended that I try it myself since it was located in close proximity to my school  He ordered me a beef melt sandwich and Nutella latte  The beef melt came with shredded beef  caramelized onions  and peppers on top of a toasted baguette topped with mozzarella cheese and plantain chips on the side  The melt was loaded with flavor and so delicious to eat  I only wish there was more of it  For $9 50  the portion was pretty small  The Nutella latte was very bland  I wish there was more of the Nutella flavor  It tasted more like chocolate milk than anything  My boyfriend thoroughly enjoyed his latte when he dined in  so Im going to blame it on the togo order  I definitely want to come back and dine here one day!,?
2062018,I found Dr Askari to be arrogant and demeaning    I have never felt so uncomfortable with an Obgyn before    I will be looking for another Dr    ,?
2063527,I found Vanessa on Yelp  I intentionally wanted a Brazilian Blow Out  Keratin Specialist is what caught my eye  Vanessa was able to get me in with a requested weeks notice  She was very friendly and such a good conversationalist  which made me feel comfortable and made it go by fast! She was very knowledgeable and was open to questions  You could tell she loves what she does and takes pride in her profession  My hair turned out perfect as expected  I definitely recommend her to anyone looking for long lasting frizz free hair  Thank you Vanessa! Ill be back for my next treatment!,?
2063633,I found a EUC Escada jumpsuit for $3!! My total (including a $ 25 donation) was $5 for 3 pair of new looking wool walking shorts  a vintage summer short sleeved sweater  the jumpsuit & a vtg pair of WW2 green lensed nonprescription sunglasses! I know  right?!? They take donations & are enthusiastically faith based  but genuinely grateful for your business or donations  This tiny shop is nestled amidst nearly a dozen (extremely price inflated) other thrift/resale/vintage shops  and is by far the best/friendliest on the block  Enjoy it!!,?
2063902,I found a hotel near the airport so I could get out easily on an early flight the next morning  Let me say the Holiday Inn had seen better days  But  I had the good fortune to find SushiYa Japan across the street for a fabulous dinner  Not sure if the staff was all family  but they acted like it and clearly took pride in their restaurant  Great service  authentic and talented sushi chefs  homey environment  and a delcious meal  So glad I found it  All thumbs up!,?
2065297,I found out my baby was breech around 34 weeks pregnant and had heard of the Webster technique to turn breech babies so figured I would give it a try  A quick Google search led me to Ryno Chiropractic (not all chiropractors are certified in the Webster technique) and Im so glad I found this practice! Not only did my breech baby turn but Dr  Ryan is so great! You can tell he truly cares about his patients and their well being ,?
2065411,I found something I had to have  We agreed on a price and I said I wanted to think it over for the night  When I returned the price was raised $1000 00  Still wanting it I put down a deposit  However  every time I returned to their store they were not there  They have never returned my calls  texts and emails  So they have my deposit and the piece of furniture  Its been more than a year and no word from them at all!!!,?
2066682,I found this florist using Yelp  I live in Los Angeles and was getting married in Las Vegas  I did my entire order over the phone and email  I worked with kimberly and she was amazing  I sent her pictures of the bouquet I wanted and told her what my budget was and she was able to do exactly what I wanted within my budget   My first wedding was ruined by a florist you forgot to do my bride bouquet so I was extremely nervous however can barely put me at ease and the end result was amazing and exactly what I wanted ,?
2067125,I found this place a few months ago and kick myself for not finding it sooner  I live very close  I had a Carnita burrito and it was sooooo good!! The best I have had so far  I ordered rice and beans also and they wrapped up my burrito in tinfoil so that everything didnt get slopped together when i took it home  Their Margaritas are awesome!!! They are pricy after happy hour is over  I dont care for their guacamole  it really doesnt have any flavor ,?
2067669,I found this place last year  I have a family with many allergies and picky about great taste too   The gelato is the best Ive ever found  Made on site by hand  allergen lists up and all marked which really helped  Wonderful taste  The little grocery side had beautiful cheeses and meats and real Italian pastas   Even a great selection of gluten free pasta  The gnocchi is to die for ,?
2068448,I found this place the same way I found Slymans  a Cleveland Teamster took me here and Im glad he did  This review is only based on breakfast and if I come back it will be for breakfast  The other menu items didnt peak my interest The breakfasts here are awesome! Its strictly old school Americana so dont expect fancy but do expect a huge breakfast  most dishes come with three eggs   You can get steak and eggs or pork chops and eggs for under $10 here  I had the steak and eggs and was surprised how good it was for the price  Even for double the price  I would have been happy  Its a great place for working folks to grab a bite before getting back to work  I would recommend Shays for an breakfast experience that will take you back in time while satisfying your hunger ,?
2069813,I freaking love this place  I love coming to Vegas for Aloha Specialties because there arent many Hawaiian food places in Cali  But we decided to try it and I never knew how well Island flavor could be done with a Korean taste  Came here the next day as well I wish I could give this place more stars ,?
2070169,I frequent often especially with out of town guests since the outside seating is excellent for people watching as well as the Bellagio watershow  Food is fairly priced (in the 20s for steak  salmon  etc)  I really enjoyed the escargot and my friend loved the baked goat cheese appetizer  Good place over all ,?
2070618,I frequent this place fairly often for a foot massage  and the odd time add on 15 minutes of back massage  I come with my parents  my sister  and my friends  I typically enjoy the massages  and if I dont like something  I speak up  Every person is different  so it has taken some time to find my person of preference  The location is clean  and the prices are good  I recommend to anyone who is looking for a relaxing self indulgence at a decent price ,?
2071166,I from ca here visiting  my son in Henderson and they wanted pizza so we found this place and the pizza was great we had the Daviola and it was very good the only draw back was it could of used more cheese but it was enjoyable   I would recommend to friends ,?
2072748,I gave this joint another shot  Since I work close by and was working Sunday night I did  I tried a sandwich the first time there a couple of weeks ago     WHERES THE MEAT!!!  Tonight  I got a 1/4 Chicken  fried yuca  & rice  The 1/4 Chicken was good  but the portions got me AGAIN    WTH????  (Check out the uploaded pics)  The wing was so done with I couldnt tell the meat from the bone  And HEY    thats suppose to be one of my two pieces!!! Both the breast & wing were small  Nearly Cornish hen small  No fork  no napkins  Luckily I found a small fork in a desh drawer      Oh well     Once  shame on me    Twice shame on VC     there wont be a third time!!! ASTA LA VISTA     VIVA!!,?
2074753,I get it    Its a cool concept and hipsterish place that is trending  The food is good if you are able to stomach an entire sandwich I think you should get an award  the sandwiches are huge! People rave about this place  I just does not send me over the top  I am not into huge portioned meals I give it a 3 because it works for everyone  They really do need to consider a bigger location though  apparaently the wait is always long at this place  Wish I had more details to share   try it out is all I have to say  be prepared to wait for a table!,?
2075032,I get my hair cut here  and now I get my nails done here too :) Really cool  comfortable room  very laid back and nails look great!,?
2075169,I get my nails done here sometimes  and Ive referred family members  Everyone has nothing but good things to say about their services  Good customer service too ,?
2075230,I get my waxing services done here every month! Ina is awesome! I HIGHLY recommended seeing her especially if you are new to getting waxed like me! She takes her time  gets all the hairs and even gets out my ingrown hairs too ,?
2075530,I get that they only have 1 fire pit for the pizza but a place like this that their most popular thing on the menu is pizzza  it should have another one to make the process go a lot faster   But they were all friendly and the pizza was amazing and cooked perfectly!,?
2076061,I give 1 review because the cashier was totally rude  It looked like she hated her job and when I asked her about a few items behind her counter she seemed so inpatient  When I was paying with my card I was about to slide it through the card machine and said wait! I waited and held my card out and she kept repeating herself even when I wasnt even doing anything but waiting  She started talking under her breathe and I thought she was just overall rude  Please tell associate: 10344 to smile a little also ,?
2076146,I give 3 stars to this location but 2 stars to Enterprise as a company  I do like the dedicated line at this location for corporate account holders and the free bottled water  But it really necessary to escort every customer out to the car and go through the spiel that every other rental car company handles at the counter? This is something that every Enterprise location does and probably results in more successful up selling of the optional insurance  But it shows a blatant disregard for the value of their customers time ,?
2076902,I give it 5 stars  because I  Loved My Dr    Dr Murty and Melissa       But while i sat in the waiting roon  i noticed a few things that i thought should be taken care of #1  the CARPET is FILTHY REAL FILTHY   #2 the seating is FILTHY Should be cleaned  alot more than im sure they are #3 the door  when its closing  sounds like a giant lizard from Jurrassic Park   I though the staff was  good at the desk  need a bigger clock for people i heard one Lady say  I dont have a Phone and i cant find a clock any where she asked to people for the time       Thank You,?
2076936,I give it 5  linen table clothes & napkins; excellent homemade pasta & sauces  family owned & operated     Excellent food at fair price  Full bar & good wine selection   Its always worth the drive!Lisa Fazio always remember us     weve had some great imported Italian wines here     best to ask the hostess to get the best for your palate ,?
2077326,I give one star for the servers being kind   We both hated our dinner   Never going back!  Only a few customer there   Food was cold and not high quality    Our expensive  dishes came out Cold?! After like 5 minutes   What do they just attempt to heat your food   Place is not cheap at all! Many choices to pick in Vegas for Asian food  go try one of those ,?
2077371,I give royal tree service a five star rating  because they were very prompt  actually arriving earlier than they were supposed to  Very reasonable and affordable  And did a fantastic job on my pine trees  everywhere else wanted a ridiculous amount for the job  they were great and friendly too! Would definetly recommend them to anyone  ,?
2077815,I give them four stars on a curve as airport Chinese food is usually not very good  The best dishes here are the entrees  not sushi or banh mi sandwiches  really this is a stir fry kind of place I had the Kung pao chicken which was very flavorful and lots of white meat  Also had a good amount of freshly cooked veggies (carrots and snap peas) which can be tough to find in an airport  It was fairly salty but I have to admit I like salty  Brown rice is great to make things a little healthier ,?
2078500,I give this place 3 5 stars  Came after work with my coworker for a much needed treat after our exhausting day and it sure hit the spot  I got the dole float which has pineapple juice added to it but it wasnt anything spectacular  I think Ill stick to just the dole whip next time  Its delicious as is  I ordered the medium and it was a nice big portion but I still think it was a bit on the pricier end  Employees were nice and explained all the drinks we had questions about  I would come again when Im having a dole whip craving until I find another place closer to me thats less pricey ,?
2078744,I give this place a 1 star brought the family here for Fathers Day  we had heard of a special they were running on the news $8per person for two hours of bowling and laser tag only to find out that special doesnt start until 8pm     we decided to stay anyways we sat at our lane for 30minutes with no service I had to walk up to the bar to order after being cut and ignored I finally got two drinks and asked how to get food he said to place the order through him and that he would find us our server to notify them we would be ordering drinks   etc after asking 3 other people who our server was a young lady came up to tell us the bar tender was our server but he had to run the bar too     we waited about 35 minutes for our $25 appetizer sampler when it finally arrived with no utensils or plates I noticed there was no cheese on our nachos which took up half of the sampler so we did not eat the nachos     we live right next door to this place and probably will never be back!,?
2079196,I give this restaurant 3 stars because the location was nice  and love how the restaurant seating is set   The lady who was our server was extremely friendly and make sure our needs were accommodated  The sushi (sunset sushi) was absolutely amazing and will definitely order that again if I visit again  What made me give the restaurant 3 starts is the how the veggies were cooked    very bland and no seasoning   the pistachio halibut was a hit and miss  wouldnt purchase it again   the plate would have been much better if the food was seasoned much better ,?
2079794,I go here a lot I love the taro tea smoothie with  Boba there are days I crave it the donuts are always fresh and tasty I gave 4 stars as they are short staffed on the weekends and sometimes I order smoothie and I get iced I tried to explain to her but the language barrier as well as her being the only one there gets in the way either way its a great place,?
2080112,I go here allot like allot     (inserts ashamed face) lol  One word    amazing! Amazing service amazing food amazing location!! I love how simple it is yet soooo delicious! I usually get the katsu chicken curry with a 24 spice level and its just so good the sauce is always boiling hot so it stays hot threwout the whole time it takes you to finish your food  This dish gets me full they offer different types of currys and high spice levels  If you love spice then go high but even a 2 will have your nose running! Lol So yes I do recommend coming here if youre from here or visiting its not too far off the strip in a little location  Parking can suck around there if youre going around dinner time so Uber it if anything  But I always am lucky enough to come when parking spaces are available  Prices vary for Currys around $8 and up!,?
2080816,I go here frequently for lunch   Great little place and I love the lunch special   Italian sandwich please   Nice folks   love the mom and pop feel where the owner works behind the counter ,?
2081792,I go so often that they now recognize me  There is another frozen yogurt place closer to my house but this place is worth the little extra walk  Its yummy  not too expensive and it had a great selection the changes often  I love this place and go biweekly  The jumba juice is also nice  The place down the street feels small  crowded and is nearly always filled with children  I like not having to sit next to a family of 5 kids while eating  This place has more seating area so I can normally find a quiet place ,?
2082115,I go to ASU right across the street and have been taking my car here regularly for oil changes for over a year now  The staff are extremely friendly and are always providing me the latest discounts  With every oil change a full inspection is done and they have even have taken me into the garage to show me concerns on the car  Never have they hassled me to do any work on my car just purely informational  I would recommend them to friends and family and in fact already have  my brother also is a regular here  Highly satisfied,?
2082715,I go to PostalMax everyday  to take the mail from my work  and i always get good service! quick and friendly! The stores dogs just make it that much better! When sending a package to a friend in the army  they gave me several different options and helped me make the best choise for time  and my budget!Wouldnt go to anyone else  (and as i go there everyday  you can trust my review!),?
2082726,I go to Rashin Beuaty for my haircuts    Best place Ive tried in Las Vegas   I typically go to Allen though I have used Ben as well   They remodeled the place last year and it looks great ,?
2082949,I go to Vegas a couple times of year and I love the whole limo experience  Doesnt everyone love to be pampered?? I took my son for his birthday and our driver was the best  He was professional and polite and not pushy  He knows about making you happy which in this day you dont always get what you pay for sometimes  He delivered us to our hotels and picked us up on time to the airport  5 stars! Good job!,?
2083248,I go to get a burger at their take out counter  I wait and wait and after waiting 10 minutes  finally the hostess comes over and I ask her if Ill be able to get my food within 67 minutes and she laughs and says no  So I ask for the manager he tells me some excuse that they are slammed and there should be 2 people there  One person there would have been enough! Its Saturday night and especially after a fight just happened at MGM  Staff your restaurant properly for the day of the week and time of day  Alas  I cannot properly tell you if their food is any good  This was my first visit to I didnt get a Steak N Shake  It will be my last ,?
2083969,I go to this location and the one on rainbow whenever Im in the mood for Mexican  Hands down the best carne asada fries in Las Vegas ,?
2085056,I got a Gold wash and they did a very good job and were very detailed  All the employees were very courteous  highly recommended!,?
2085470,I got a call this morning to come in to try this new place  Im glad I did the food is amazing! Well presented and delicious  Breakfast burrito is on point! The party tots are very unique and good as well  I made a custom drink lime sparkling water with cherry vanilla dr pepper  They were also passing out fresh baked cookies! Best morning ever :),?
2085531,I got a chance to dine in Mama Santas and the the wait was nearly an hour   if the weather is nice its worth the wait and the stroll around Little Italy to check out the ethnic village   if not your stuck in the rain or in a crammed hall way  The pizza is high quality with generous portions  I also enjoyed the manicotti and homemade meatballs   This is a great family spot with an old school dining experience  Try and ask for a booth as the tables are similar to school desks  Great food  3rd or 4th generation Italian spot for every walk of life ,?
2085875,I got a deluxe pedicure here and the lady who did my pedicure was gentle and friendly  I love that they  give you a hot stone massage  I have not had that at other salons without paying an extra markup  The service you get for the price is above and beyond other salons I have been to  They have a huge assortment of colors to choose from and offer gel as well  I also like that I got to choose from 3 scents for my lotions and water bath  The inside is very clean and upscale  I cant wait to be back,?
2086552,I got a groupon for a state inspection here  I made an appointment and was in and out in less than thirty minutes  They were very friendly!,?
2086826,I got a letter in the mail from PNC  They demanded I get Homeowners Insurance of their choosing  $1700 00 a year  Now mind you I all ready have homeowners insurance at $600 00 a year  Now that $1700 00 sure sounds great  haha  but Ill stick with the one I have  I emailed my Insurance cover with all of my discounts and payments  Paid in full  I dont do escrow  If not mistaken Wells Fargo just in trouble for doing the same thing I have a Mortgage and auto loans from PNC  plus a few checking and savings accounts  My PNC is in Raeford nc  It has that small town flavor and great people  But corporate PNC is the worst to work with  Example  simple ReFi took from June 2017 until September 2017  They made it so hard to refi that I was going to go to another back but we final closed  Check please  Local bank is great  corporate sucks ,?
2088264,I got an excellent mattress during their king for queen event  Reasonable price  free sameday delivery  and theyll haul your old mattress away  The stuff was knowledgeable  helpful  and not too pushy (which I was worried about)  My next mattress will likely come for Best Mattress as well ,?
2088549,I got charged 186 29 $ for a regular tune up and 2 tires changed  I think it is way overpriced   Also my bike is not properly adjusted  When im on my first gear my chain touch a metal part which is something i never experienced from previous tune up from other places    ,?
2089325,I got in and I got out   I tried the Black and White  which is the vanilla latte with cinnamon   Not a typical coffee shop that I would lounge around though   not my type of environment   I think it is a great spot for students I like the yelp check in for a free coffee  though I didnt use it ,?
2090121,I got my car washed here two days ago and everything was good they offered me a receipt with a rain check policy for 3 days and the guy even said it was going to rain that night so I was happy that I had a rain check so today I went to use the rain check and they have suddenly changed their policy on how they do it and now all you get is the self serve car wash where you would pay $3 somewhere else and have to dry and do all the detail yourself  Kind of a lousy rain check policy if you ask me  Was planning on buying a drink and a snack in the lobby but since I didnt even get out of my vehicle they lost the profit on that I wont be getting my car washed here again,?
2090598,I got my goto drink  grass jelly roasted milk tea  30% sugar  and this is the first location that disappointed me with this drink  There wasnt enough milk in it  It wasnt creamy enough  Sad  On the upside  this is the location I got my first 10 points for vicinity at! Huzzah  Free drink next time ,?
2091134,I got my nails done here a year ago  diamond French  and I looooooved them  They did a great job and were super friendly and the space was beautiful  I highly recommend ,?
2091206,I got my nails here a few times and never had been treated horribly wrong and the service is great my nails are pretty good and bright colored also the massage on the feet and legs are great Ive been to many places in Las Vegas but this place is amazing!!!! My grandma loved it she love the staff  massages  EVERYTHING!!!!,?
2092238,I got some cupcakes here last year and I might as well have stopped off at metro or sobeys and got a box of cake mix and a can of icing  Gross  Maybe they make good cakes or bars but not good cupcakes  I also think that vanilla cupcakes should have white vanilla icing on them  Unless I am ordering a hundred for a party and want them to match a decor  I just dont get it  Call me crazy  To top it off  staff was aloof I think they were in the middle of some gossip that I interrupted  Sorry folks ,?
2092991,I got the Catfish platter with Mac & Cheese and Potato Salad  It was some of the best catfish Ive ever had  and I am pretty picky about catfish and Lowcountry food in general  The batter was awesome and so was the tartar sauce  The Mac & cheese was smooth  creamy  and cheesy  The potato salad has a kick to it  Our waitress was the sweet and knowledgeable Miss Emerald  Her expertise with the menu helped us pick the perfect meals  She knew how to engage in just the right amount of conversation to make us feel welcome and appreciated  Overall great experience  Ill be back  for sure ,?
2094394,I got the daily drip and it was so good   Having been used to too much of Starbucks  Cartels slightly sweet light bodied coffee was a good change of taste  The place has a hippy ambience which reminded me of cafes in Austin  TX  It was amazing to see all the inhouse roasting machinery  Good ambience  good coffee  Will definitely visit next time  armored with my computer to get some work done ,?
2095418,I got the romantic bangkok with Thai tea ice cream  wafer roll and condensed milk  For $6 50 I was pleasantly surprised  The girl who rolled our ice cream had such good technique it was fun to watch!,?
2095717,I got the sugar cookie and the coco lime and both were to die for! I dont find myself craving specific cookies too often but I will think of this place in the future!,?
2096753,I got to the airport super early for my flight and I was dreading the wait  But the free wifi at McCarran was so great and the wait passed quickly  Security was relatively fast and the little tram that you take to the D Gates is really fun  And if you havent lost enough money in Vegas already  you can always play some slots while youre waiting to board ,?
2097635,I gotten sick with the stomach infection also known as the BUBBLE GUTS the last two times Ive eaten there and my husband did too  Called to talk to someone in charge & they thought it was funny  Ill never eat there again  What are they doing to the chicken? Are they not washing it Off before cooking it or maybe their hands ,?
2098091,I grew up eating fish in Seattle  where most seafood chains dont survive   Im an admitted seafood snob  and Ive been suffering fish withdrawal ever since I moved to Phoenix   That said  Mandys is GOOD fried fish I had cornmeal breaded cod  hush puppies and cole slaw   The fish and pups were served right from the fryer  piping hot and perfectly done   Breading on the fish was thin and crisp  just as it should be  and the fish was flaky and flavorful   The hush puppies were crispy outside  had no hint of mushiness inside  and were delicious   Mandys tartar sauce appears to be homemade and is excellent   One star off for the cole slaw  which was fresh and not soupy  but lacked flavor Finally  good fish in Phoenix!  Ill definitely be back ,?
2098989,I grew up near the original location  so I had to try this place out! Had bean burro and tostadas to share with children   My child  who is a picky eater  loved them! Best bean burro in town! The family is the ones cooking and helping you  so they take make the effort to make your experience a good one  Try it and you wont be sorry!!!,?
2099649,I guess I havent been here in a while  but they didnt let 2 of our guys in  out of a 8person group  5 of us were girls  We were dressed up as greasers coming back from zappos holiday party  so I guess they didnt like the attire? Lame ,?
2099759,I guess I should have gotten the pizza  but we had just had pizza the night before  The lasagna that another in my party and I ordered was not very good  I am a big guy and usually dont leave much food behind  but I did not finish this meal   partly because they do give you big portions  but partly because it just wasnt that pleasant to eat  Another in our party felt the same way about an Alfredo dish  In fairness  my wife did enjoy her manicotti ,?
2099907,I guess I was spoiled with the real deal at Mama Es in Oklahoma city   The service was super slow  food quality was poor   Wont go back ,?
2100346,I guess einsteins has gone down because of the minimum wage hike  I was in there today and my bagel had half of the egg and cream cheese they use to give  I had one bagel with egg and cheese and one bagel with cream cheese and a large OJ which was suppose to be fresh which it wasnt and the cost was $13 63  It was like what? Seems very expsensive for what you get ,?
2100374,I guess first impressions are done and over with  and Jamies Italian has settled into their routine  The second time around  everything seems a little less   shiny  The food was about the same  but the service has certainly suffered  It took a long time to get water  much less anything else  Our server had a knack for disappearing for long periods of time  Our food arrived before our drinks  and when it came time to pay  she was nowhere to be found  This time  food wise  got the prosciutto & pear salad which  to be honest  should be called prosciutto and arugula salad as there was hardly any pear in the salad at all  And though I was told it was large  it wasnt entirely filling as an entree    I would have maybe ordered an app had I known  Its a good size to share for 2  however  and actually really good  Just a LITTLE more pear would be an improvement  Also had the brownie dessert  good  but nothing to write home about  Perhaps will try the tiramisu next time ,?
2100740,I guess living in Colorado spoils me  Wayyyy too many people on a Tuesday morning  Ugh  It really ruined the experience  And no trees made the heat unbearable for this mountain girl ,?
2101937,I had 2 separate orders of shirts that were misprinted  by Galloree  There were multiple shirts where the designs were either missing or placed wrong  shirts were the wrong size  and some designs were already cracking upon arrival  One shirt even had a yellow stain on it like from a marker  After emailing them multiple times with pictures of the errors and also calling them multiple times (with no answer) I now believe that they are just going to avoid me entirely  Their printing quality and customer service are equally terrible  Buyer beware!,?
2101956,I had 2 vacs that needed repair diagnosis  Working with Nate was incredible! He was extremely friendly  professional and knowledgeable  He helped me get both vacs working in a short time frame  It was a very positive experience  I plan to go back & purchase a new fan & current vac model in the near future  Im sold on the product & great service from Nate Bruce B,?
2102547,I had Cut Rate Glass replace 2 broken window panes and the seal around a third window today  They provided great service  The service technicians were very thorough and polite  Service schedule was great with one day between getting the quote and having the work done with a great price! Highly recommend using this company  Great job!,?
2103001,I had John as my piercer  He was excellent! Very comforting and knowledgable! The staff in general was very friendly and helpful  The studio was very clean as well! I would highly recommend HTC for anyone seeking a piercing!,?
2103039,I had Karen do my root touch up and she went above and beyond with my hair! Not only did she fix my horrible grays  but she also spent time giving my hair a gloss and showing me how to blow dry my hair to give me far more volume! They really spent a great deal of time discussing my hair  what I wanted now and what I might want to do in the future! :) I definitely recommend the salon  and Karen Landgraff in particular!! :),?
2103918,I had VERY high expectations for this place  simply because of the GR name attached to it  and I am a huge food network fan  But maybe because of those high expectations  this place didnt quite deliver for me ):I split the farm burger & truffle fries with a friend  And the burger was good  yes  but not amazing  Admittedly  everything was well cooked  nicely made  and beautifully presented  but the burger just seemed to be missing something  I think maybe I wouldve liked some lettuce or tomatoes in my burger? Some kind of veggies to balance out the patty and the egg? The fries were good  but not noteworthy either  Their house ketchup was different  and I probably wouldve preferred just plainol heinz Anywho  overall  the burgers were good  just not as good as I wouldve expected from GR  Maybe if the bar hadnt been set so high  this place wouldve gotten 4 stars instead of 3  But solid burgers  decently priced for being on the strip  just dont expect amazing ,?
2104178,I had a 1967 Ford pickup truck with more dents in the body than you could count  One of the mechanics accidently put one more in my drivers side door (a little tiny ding like you would get from a shopping cart)  The reason they get five stars is because if your employees feel comfortable enough to tell their bosses when they do something like that  than that is a pattern and ethic set by management/ownership  They obviously value honesty and integrity over profit  If my blind  wheelchair bound Grandma was still alive  this is where I would send her to get her car fixed  because that is how much I trust these guys  :^/       Just kidding about my grandma  Wheel chair bound women cant drive!,?
2104808,I had a Groupon that said for lunch   Their website has no info about lunch hours   Some other site stated 11 am  2 pm  I have a few friends in & we go on a Saturday   The place is locked up   Theres some sign that says they open at 5 pm   I email Groupon & they say the owners will call in the next two days   They dont   I get a refund I think livingsocial or similar had a deal afterwards & they at least listed the hours   I think they are closed on weekends      so make sure you call ahead with their odd days & hours of operation And then these businesses wonder why they are eventually closed 7 days a week ,?
2105373,I had a bad experience here for it it being the best nail salon in las vegas as their sign says  I got seated quickly which was good   but i just got my nails done 3 days ago and i got the gel manicure   which the polish shouldnt chip off   bench why some places call it no chip manicure  but what do you know   they chipped  the woman filed my nails in an ugly shape   which i tried to fix when i got home  2 of my nails have broke in the past two days from how flimsy they left them and im very disappointed since recently ive been growing my nails out  The workers that my step mother & i had were giving us rude looks and being very annoying & disrespectful  5/10 fingers nail polish has chipped in the corners & i do not do a lot with my hands  dont recommend!,?
2106487,I had a car antenna when I went into the lane tickets are written up  the person writing the ticket verified I had a car antenna  took off the car antennae and said it would be in the car   The antenna was not in the car when the car wash was done  and Metro car wash said there was never an antenna  oh well  live and learn  I will not go back to Metro Car Wash ,?
2106526,I had a carpet repair done by Robert   He is anal about arrival time  not a minute late    His sense of humor was wonderful   The repair was perfect   Could not have been better!,?
2108578,I had a fantastic experience here! Wonderful service everybody was on top of their game  Awesome wine selection and our steaks were cooked very well  I will be back ,?
2108869,I had a few issues with the services provided  however they have made steps to fixing my worries  Dr  Magri is very good at what he does  however they need to be clearer in what they are doing/charging for ,?
2108894,I had a few problems with my stay    I was supposed to be there for a week but after one night we had to check out  The first problem was the airconditioning in my room would not work  only heat  the second problem is we had no hot water  In the morning when I woke up the airconditioning was still not working in the water was the best lukewarm  I did not contact the staff that night because I didnt check in to the hotel until very late  At 6:30 the next morning we were checking out and was told they were going to charge us $75 fee to check out early   They sent an engineer up to the room and determined everything was working perfectly?  Nicole R   the front desk manger  was called and waived the fee to allow me to check out of this aging hotel that needs an upgrade and better customer service    This Hilton Honors member wont be back ,?
2109224,I had a friend in town on a Monday evening   We walked around Mill Avenue and decided to go in there   Bad idea   This place was disgusting and it smells horrible  I ordered a drink and almost threw it up   It tasted spoiled   The place is super dark and Im guessing this is because the place is in such poor condition that they dont want you to see how bad the place is I would stay away from this place!,?
2109270,I had a friend staying at the Hilton and we went to Tundra for drinks on a Saturday night around midnight  The place was almost empty  Not a hoppin night spot  but it is a nice place to talk  The server was professional and courteous  When we first sat down  he said you guys look a little young  do I need to check your ID?  to which we burst into laughter  and he seemed a bit embarrassed and didnt actually make us show ID  They do a very nice martini  I hadnt seen this friend for a long time and we had a lot to catch up on  so our waiter allowed us to stay as long as we wanted after closing (we just had to settle the bill first)  It was sorta nice to have the entire bar to ourselves!,?
2109301,I had a friend visiting me and she wanted to eat Thai  pad Thai in particular  I looked up a good Thai place and this one was the first one on the list  There is street parking easy to find in the neighborhood  The ambiance is very good  Actually I liked it very much  Light was enough  They were playing some nice Thai music  Waiter was very nice and courteous to us  The restrooms are clean  I ordered Thai iced tea  which was a disaster because I dint like milk or sugar in my iced tea and I forgot to mention it  It was very sweet with a good amount of milk in it  The spring rolls were small but very tasty  It is served with a nice sauce  For main course  I ordered yellow curry with Tofu and brown rice  The quality and taste of brown rice is amazing  it is unique to this place and worth trying out  Curry was very good  My friend liked her Pad Thai too  It is one of the very nice Thai restaurants in Cleveland ,?
2109324,I had a friend who worked at one in the Carolinas and decided a group of us would go since weve heard such good stuff     I wasnt impressed  Nachos were good & drinks were nice and big but burgers & chicken sandwiches were not tasty  As far as the waitress being mean experience:  our waitress made no jokes  and turned and said she was pregnant and wasnt in the mood to act the way theyre known for  Buzz kill  Kind of a one time visit restaurant ,?
2109440,I had a fun time the other day playing some of the games they had offered  They took over a old comic place but have redone it so its more suited to playing tabletop games  I spent less than an hour there but will update my review once I have some more time,?
2109554,I had a gift card to Applebees so I went for lunch   Except for being incredibly calorie laden the food was good and prepared in a timely manner  Service staff was nice and took good care of me Given the choice I would chose something else but free food is never bad ,?
2110555,I had a great experience at Fin & Fino   The restaurant itself is beautiful!  The drinks and food were also very good and pretty reasonably priced considering its a seafood restaurant in uptown Charlotte   The bartender was very helpful and informative ,?
2110828,I had a great experience at the 32nd Ave  location   Staff were extremely knowledgeable and friendly   I got additional RAM installed for about 60 00 including the 4 GB RAM   Ill be back ,?
2111050,I had a great experience at this store  I found the staff informative and helpful and the products are pretty good quality and reasonably priced  Although the staff told me to contact them if I had any issues  I havent had to return or make adjustments to anything I purchased ,?
2111415,I had a great experience here! Friendly staff  very accommodating and nice to talk to  I really enjoyed my huge frozen Margarita and they gave us chips and salsa to go with it  I will definitely be going back again ,?
2112658,I had a great experience with this company! Hired them to do a cleanup on yard  I had gotten behind  weedeater had broken  so it had quickly become a mess  and more than I wanted to tackle personally  Thought prices were very reasonable  and they did SUCH a good job  Hired them after that to come weekly for maintenance   first time Ive done that  just too much on my plate to keep doing it myself  They are very professional  nice and yard looks amazing  They are very detail oriented  They even really blow off the patio  Saves me from sweeping and looks so clean after they are here  Sounds little  but the people they hire at my work  lawn debris always is scattered on the porch requiring me to vacuum each time they leave  Just plain extra work that a blower could do in a few seconds  Anyways  I appreciate the job they do  its been a really great experience so far  and highly recommend them!,?
2112665,I had a great experience with this company very fast  reliable  and professional  I plan to have repeat business with Valle Verde Lawn Care  Thank you for the service ,?
2112999,I had a great first experience at Nailsense   I had two technicians to complete my minimanimakeover   Ngan did the dirty work: cleanedup my cuticles and gave my nails a uniform shape that I always seem to have a tough time doing on my own  Kim then came in and did a meticulous shellac job on my nails  I was hoping for a mint green finish (which wasnt available) so I opted for purple    It turned out just grape  I mean great  Anyway  yes    The service was pleasant  but very quiet and the background music they played was comparable to elevator music (piano versions of 80s AM radio hits)  Ew Anyway  I found the manicure and shellac pricey ($39 55 taxin  a welldeserved $8 tip) but Ill definitely be back to let them tackle my feet!,?
2113643,I had a great time at this location! Although the mall itself is a little sketchy  the store is clean and well organized  Recently I was assisted by Danielle Lou who was super helpful  She sized me for the correct size and even helped me find the exact color  style  size  i wanted!,?
2114050,I had a great time! We didnt have passes  but didnt have to wait in line or pay a cover (though we were 5 girls on a thursday night  which is definitely less busy than weekends)  Sure  there was a circle of some pretty shady guys around us the entire time  but hey  where in vegas arent there shady guys??,?
2114407,I had a half salad/half brown rice bowl with salmon  tuna luau  and octopus  There are a number of other toppings to choose from  pickled radish ads a nice crunch  as do fried onions  Places like this as starting to pop up all over and I for one welcome the trend ,?
2114963,I had a horrible odor coming from a guest bathroom sink and then I thought the odor traveled to other sinks   I finally decided to get a plumber to my house to fix whatever the problem was   I found GNC Plumbing through Yelp and gave them a call   He was able to come the next morning which was fantastic!  He suggested we clean out all eight ptraps and bleach them out since that was most likely the issue and why there was the odor   He and his son took care of this quickly (within 40 minutes)  and left no mess behind   They are both very professional and very nice and that is a difficult combination to find these days   The cost was more than reasonable and I will call upon Gary / GNC Plumbing again when I have a plumbing repair need  Thank you for such a pleasant experience!,?
2115002,I had a hot fudge sundae here   The only problem is they dont inform you of special deserts   It was ok   I love the decor of the place   Great place to stop and beat the Vegas heat ,?
2115774,I had a lot of trouble deciding what to order off of the perfect diner menu at Cozy Corner  but finally settled on the Eggs Benedict  Then the helpful server asked: How would you like your eggs? Soft  medium  or hard cooked? I went middleoftheroad and ordered medium  Five minutes later two PERFECTLY cooked eggs arrived on top of smoky Canadian bacon  with goey centers that drizzled out in a photoworthy way when I pierced them with my fork  And the home fries were sizzling crisp on the side  An awesome meal  My only complaint: the restaurant doesnt seem to be on the corner of anything  Cozy  yes indeed; corner  no  But who cares when they deal amazing meals from their straightarrow location?,?
2116684,I had a new talent Denise cut and color my hair  She was awesome! She listened to me about the lenght of my hair  She checked my coloring and eye color to make sure the dyes would look good  She did an awesome job at cutting my hair  I never felt so beautiful leaving a salon! I also had a facial by Faye  She was so out of this world awesome! My skin was radient for days! She is so relaxing and enjoyable  My husband was pleased with my hair and skin  Worth every penny!I have recommended this salon to my family and friends ,?
2116766,I had a nice lunch on Memorial Day at Chipotle   I got the salad with steak  but no rice and beans and grilled veggies   It was wonderfully seasoned and I loved it   I will definitely come back for this same dish   I loved that they provide you a menu with the nutrition information on it and you can estimate what your calorie and fat counts are   That does a lot to help you make better food choices  I also love the fun decor in the restaurant   Its modern with a hint to an Aztec or Mayan  culture and it is well lit One thing I would like to see is that the seating area needed to be cleaned   The only available table I had was not cleaned  so I had to sit at a table like that  yuk   That made me begin looking around at the over all condition and the floors needed to be swept  too   Other than the cleaning the experience was nice and so I will be back   I look forward to clean tables next time!,?
2117377,I had a plumbing stoppage   the main line needed to be snaked  I used my home warranty  who contracted this company Technician wanted to charge me before work was completed  he also tried to upsell me to get the service done rightThats not how home warranty services work  and these are scam tactics,?
2117545,I had a pretty crappy experience at another car wash that i reviewed last week   This one gets 4 stars for being totally opposite  First  it has a quarter machine (!!!) Second  it has a working vacuum   4 to be exact  The vacuum is $1 (i believe)  i had enough time to vacuum the front & back of my car  the floor mats & i did not rush  This car wash has one automatic/notouch wash  5 hand wash spots  I am not sure of the prices since I only came for a vacuum  The lot is easy to get in and out of even if its busy  Thankful to have found this and its only 5 minutes from my house in south side ,?
2117612,I had a pretty good first experience with South Side  but not wowworthy quite yet!I definitely enjoyed myself on the patio on a warm summer evening  I got the portobello gyro  which had portobello  mozzarella  and a creamy slightly spicy sauce  I had a very plentiful side of chips  The vegetarian dishes look to be aok Ill have to come back to try the lobster bisque that I keep hearing about! I had a taste of my bfs grouper sandwich  and I think Id like to go back and try more As for the service  I had a pretty good experience with it  From the reviews  this seems to be hit or miss!,?
2117750,I had a problem on a return trip from Sky Harbor Airport to my home but Super Shuttle rectified the situation to my satisfaction ,?
2118166,I had a really bad experience there  I really dont like doing reviews but you should really know that your going to be treated poorly there  The Manager was extremely rude and when I asked for her name she wouldnt give it to me  I was going to tell her Corporate Manager how she treated me but have decide to just Never go there again  Try and pay your rent with no customers I say and see where that gets you  Ungrateful and Very Unprofessional!,?
2118575,I had a really great experience with this bakery  I am not a huge cake fan so for my wedding I did a large order of cake pops  Great customer service  fair prices and the cake pops were amazing!!!!! I had cookies and cream  pink champaign  vanilla  and chocolate all my guest loved them! I will be going back again very soon!,?
2119150,I had a rush job for notary service right before they closed and I had a wrong date   Dawn the store rep was so incredibly helpful   She suggested that I contact someone at home to email to the store and she not only stayed later but she fixed the document and emailed the correction back to me   You dont find customer service like that   Will be back for any shipping needs ,?
2119232,I had a satisfactory appointment with Dr  Wilson today  I have nothing but complimentary comments to say I found Dr  Wilson after some research for some less invasive surgery options  I will admit I was feeling a little reprehension after reading some  negative reviews  I liked the following things:1) The office  bathrooms  and rooms were clean2) Dr  Wilson met with me in her office before my exam3) Dr  Wilson patiently listened to my health concerns 4) Dr  Wilson gave me a frank and direct treatment plan5) Dr  Wilson was thorough and gentle during examsI will be scheduling my procedure with Dr  Wilson  I am confident she is a professional and skilled physician ,?
2119266,I had a scoop of the Peanut Butter Brownie  it was delicious  Cute little place  Id definitely go back ,?
2120104,I had a surprise birthday for my girlfriend at Kickstand last Saturday and was very delighted with how well everything was taken care of from providing a private room to great food and drinks  The manager Justin really looked after each of my guests and made sure everyone was enjoying themselves  If you get a chance to stop by I would highly recommend one of their mouthwatering burgers!,?
2120222,I had a tattoo done by robert silva in hollister  I get a lot of compliments on my tattoo  Now he is in vegas and I am planning a trip to vegas just to get some work done  If you want a nice clean detail work done on you then hit up robert he will not disappoint  he is good  the best artist dont waste your time getting work done anywhere else Great job Robert see you soon ,?
2120490,I had a terrible experience with Express Flooring   The crew arrived on a Saturday late and without enough supplies to complete my job in one day as planned which caused me to have to take time off work   I was trying trying to avoid this by having a Saturday installation    On top of that  it has been two weeks and they did not have my baseboards to install as planned and they have yet to process my refund for what I paid for them   I called the office several times to work the issue out and I was given the run around   This companys customer service is none existent!  Beware!,?
2121033,I had a very bad experience at this gas station  The attendant was a snotty little teenager who was not helpful at all  My receipt didnt print at the pump and when I asked her for help  she told me that it was probably ok ,?
2121223,I had a very efficient experience working with Monique to get my phone up and running  Clifton was also helpful and polite and had the store well organized and laid out  I was very grateful they stayed a bit after closing at 8pm to service the remaining customers with our phones  My phone is so important and Im grateful to have a polite  efficient   courteous staff as my go to store ,?
2121468,I had a very good lunch with a sea bass and cauliflower puree  Francisco was our waiter and he was very professional and friendly  Great place for lunch while at the Venitian ,?
2121469,I had a very good massage from Lee   Very strong and worked at my pressure points as well   He gave me a full body massage from head to toe after soaking my feet in hot water   He ended the massage with hot stones   I havent had a really good massage like this in a very long time   I cant vouch for all the massage therapist at this location  but I can tell Lee is very experienced and knows what hes doing   Thank you  Lee! I will be requesting you by name from now on:),?
2121505,I had a very hard time finding someone to just call me back  however  Jacob not only called me back  but was able to come out and fix my broken valve within 24 hours   He was very knowledgeable and I never felt like I was being told I needed more work than was necessary   For the quality of work  he was very  very reasonably priced   I will defiantly be using Jacob again ,?
2122751,I had a wonderful experience here while in Vegas  As other reviews note  the service is excellent  We had a table right outside over looking the fountain  It was 80 degrees that night and so lovely to be outside and watch the fountains dance to the music  We opted for the prix fixe menu  Started with the oysters then had langostines and finally tai snapper and dessert  The cheesecake on the dessert menu is phenomenal  What I loved about this whole experience is that it wasnt stuffy  It was relaxed and extremely professional ,?
2124028,I had an absolute blast with Danielle at Paige and Elliot finding my dream dress   She was so helpful and made it so carefree   She did a great job navigating the opinions of my entourage (ha!) that was with me (mom  maid of honor  and friend) and what they wanted to see me wear  and really listened to what I wanted   The selection is perfect  wide variety without being overwhelming   The experience was fun and genuine   I found my dream gown and cannot wait for it to arrive! I would highly recommend checking out Paige and Elliot for your wedding dress!,?
2124296,I had an amazing dinner here and next time Im in Vegas I will eat here again! We got there a bit early to grab a seat at the bar and try the Margaritas  The bartender David was super cool and very knowledgeable  We tried a couple different tequilas  as they have a good selection  He gave us a few recommendations on the menu and he was right on  Very cool guy!We had the squash blossoms for an app and they are very tasty  The sauce had amazing flavor  I had the huge NY steak and it was perfect  The homemade steak sauce was so good  It also came with a twice baked potato  tasty  Bfriend  had the pork tenderloin and it was the best ever  Huge cuts and it also was served with two great sauces  Food had so much flavor!Service was very good and the decor is nice  Seating is a bit tight and you do need a reservation  You can eat at the bar  but there are only like 8 seats  I could not have been any happier!Very nice wine list too!!,?
2124417,I had an amazing experience at this spa  It was relaxing  She made me feel comfortable and I enjoyed my experience doing a body massage there  I would definitely come back here again ,?
2124813,I had an amazing time here on a weekday night  The servers were very attentive  and very friendly  I came with a party of 4 and we all had a great time  We chose the $23 95 option that came with more seafood  The meat here is fresh  but the seafood was very subpar  I am not a seafood person  so it was not a big deal for me  The soups and stews here were also meh  but again  not a big deal for me  They have this oil and salt mixture that I cannot find at other KBBQ places  Its amazing  and complements the meats so well  Honestly  it might be the reason why this review is getting fivestars  The KBBQ place down the street cannot compare in meat quality with KG BBQ  Definitely coming again during my next visit to LV!! Cant wait ,?
2125329,I had an appointment with Dr  Rodriguez today   it was a wonderful experience!!!   His office staff was very nice and very professional    I went in for a health issue Ive been dealing with since Spring  which he helped me with and also had a consult for some cosmetic surgery    I felt very comfortable with him   He has a great bedside matter and was not trying to rush me out the door   Just a nice guy who appears very down to earth!!  He took his time and explained everything in detail about what I wanted and my concerns   Hes very seasoned in his profession and I would feel comfortable with having him perform surgery on me   Thank you for the great experience!,?
2126167,I had an excellent experience at HAIR   To begin the staff was very friendly and attentive   Kelli is amazing  she did a great job listening to what I was looking for in a cut and highlight   I was very happy with my blonde balayage and will definitely be going back!,?
2126289,I had an excellent experience today at Ashley furniture! Paula was the sales associate I had worked with today    She was very knowledgeable  and never made me feel pressured to purchase  Choosing an item was very easy  and so was the check out process   While browsing here  be sure to ask about specials and sales  The prices listed are not the prices with these included  I got a great deal on a loveseat for 50% off! The furniture is highquality  heavy duty and well worth the price   Definitely check this place out for some great hidden deals!,?
2126802,I had an incredible positive car purchase experience with this dealership  I am very happy with my new 2017 Chevy Sonic LT  They are organized wonderfully allowing most of the deal to be structured over the phone  They also held to what they committed  a unique experience for me with Phoenix area car dealerships  Special shout outs to my sales team Doug Harris and Derek Miller  my finance team Steve Jachners  Lisa Kuchtal and Nick Pitts and the GM Jay Schedtke who all played a role in getting a great result!,?
2127778,I had bbq ribs just ok mac n cheese not tasty not served warm my wife had pulled porkNot served hot very dry service was just okServer could care less attitude ,?
2128355,I had been feeling sick recently cough/cold       I called and asked about coming in   I didnt really expect much but I figured hey it cant hurt can it The workers greeted me right away and were very nice to me asked me what I would like and explained the options locals also get a discount which is totally awesome who doesnt love a discount right :) They take your temp and blood pressure and hook you right up they have a few rooms you can pick from one with Netflix reg tv massage chairs it didnt take long actually felt like I was just in there 30 min I cant say I noticed a huge result but ImAlso not sure what is totally wrong with me      I didnt expect to go to straight 100 percent but I would do it again maybe for a hangover or something else it was worth it and the price you cant beat it,?
2129129,I had been looking for a new stylist since moving to Charlotte and did a ton of research before making an appointment with Danielle  I am so happy that I did  Danielle is easy to discuss different color and cut ideas  My balayage turned out just like the pictures that I brought in   Highly recommend!,?
2129619,I had been routinely browsing the website for adoptable dogs when I came across one that I wanted to meet in person  I headed down to the shelter  When I arrived I learned that the dog I wanted to meet had been adopted  I was glad that he had gotten a forever home  The staff was very helpful and friendly  They asked me what I was looking for in a dog  size  age  etc  I was able to find another dog that I wanted to meet  They brought Perry our to meet me  We went out back and spent some time getting to know each other  In a matter of 30 minutes I knew that I wanted Perry to be part of my family  I completed the paperwork and paid the adoption fee  This part was super quick and easy  So glad that I visited the SPCA ,?
2130146,I had been to the Mojo on Mill  however  Id never tired this one It had far less flavor options than on Mill  but they had not one  not two  but THREE flavors of mochi and a whole ton a great fresh fruit  I was quite satisfied by the topping selection; if anything  there were too many options!However  what bumps this three star review up to four was the beanie wearing guy at the counter  He was interesting  friendly  and he actually seemed to care about my responses   Not only that  but Ive been to Mojo a ton of times  and no one ever offered me a punch card  He did  and even gave me an extra punch  Service here definitely made the visit!,?
2130651,I had been wanting to go to this place forever! I had never heard of it until it popped up in my sponsored feed on instagram  Drove from Centennial Hills and it was worth the drive  If it was closer Im sure I would frequent more often  I love the burger  Stayed formed and didnt fall a part like most vegan burgers  Highly recommended   ,?
2131885,I had called Ron about a stopped up toilet and shower   I called at 10:30 at night  and scheduled him for the next AM   I randomly flushed an upstairs toilet (mostly to make sure it wasnt draining into my tub) and suddenly all my drains emptied   Im guessing thats a fluke  but I called Ron the next day and he gave me advice and said it sounded like he didnt need to come  but hed be happy to if I wanted   He told me to check the sewer drain lines and how to check if they were clear   I would rather pay a fair price for an honest plumber  then a lower price for one who will add on things  or not be honest with me   If youre like me  call Ron! :),?
2132112,I had checked previous Yelpers stating how wonderful the food was here  And they were most definitely right The service was top notch  we got seated almost right away even though the place was packed  Great portions for being French cuisine  The ah loved streak was divine  The peppercorn sauce complemented the steak  The fries were amazing due to the extra crisp texture  Best breakfast I had hands down Will recommend and will come back soon ,?
2132881,I had dinner here last night First impression  Chips and salsa made inhouse   The salsa was wellbalanced with tomatoes  onion  and chilies   It was a good mediumspicy variety    It could be improved with a little fresh cilantro The menu includes a huge number of items   I was going to do my usual testdrive with cheese and beef enchiladas  but then I saw the Chorizo & Egg burrito  The burrito was massive  It was finished with a light bath of red sauce and covered in meted cheese   There was a good ratio of Chorizo to egg (are you listening Taco Cabana?) The rice was surprisingly good   Only Taco Diner has served me better rice   The beans were adequately seasoned but not salty   They were smooth and covered in melted cheese Solid meal and I will be back to try some of the house specialties My only gripe is that the carpeted floor really needed vacuuming ,?
2133084,I had dinner here with family and we all left feeling very satisfied! We tried most vegetarian items on the menu and everything was delicious  I especially enjoyed a halloumi and beet salad and we were all raving about the hummus  The service was great too  very friendly and attentive  As a group of 4 relatively picky and all vegetarian adults  its not often that were all left raving about a new restaurant pick but Little Sito is somewhere well all be going back to!,?
2133207,I had dinner once and breakfast 3 times while my truck was in shop  Dinner was good in the bar  Breakfast was great  Had the same thing each day  Two scrambled eggs  3 strips of bacon  grits  and toast  all prepared well  Service was almost fast food quick and not much more cost ,?
2133371,I had dinner with my girls on a Monday for the $20 bruschetta and wine  The ambiance speaks for itself  the food is absolutely delicious  But  Let me just say this  Michael Rhodes is amazing! The two times Ive been to this location  Ive been blessed to get this awesome spirit both times to wait on me  He was well versed in his wines  recommended great selections from the menu  and wore a smile like no other  Thank you for your great service and food!,?
2133444,I had done yoga a few times before visiting Yoga on the Rocks  The instructor did not explain how to do the positions  he just named the positions and assumed we all knew how to do the poses  He stood at the back of the room  making it difficult to follow him  I had to keep turning around or watch the other students ,?
2134042,I had fondue sliders  They were pretty good  Id like to have tried some of the other items on the menu  but I just wasnt that hungry  Crazy good selection of beer ,?
2134152,I had found this restaurant on yelp before heading up to Montreal for a weeklong trip  It was the first breakfast we had  and definitely the best (even though the other food was great too)! We went on a week day and there was still a wait  but not too long which was appreciated (the best restaurants are worth waiting for)!I liked the serving of fruit first  and my eggs with mushrooms over toast was phenomenal  and enough to take home for seconds! There was a huge variety on the menu  Would definitely recommend going to this establishment! Id definitely go back if in Montreal again!,?
2134690,I had gotten in an accident and AAA had set up a reservation for me to pick up a car at this location at 4 pm  So I called the hertz 800 number and they sent me the information and location to get the car and I decided to call this store ahead of time to know if it was ok to pick up the car cause I had gotten a confirmation email and the pickup date was that same day and i cant remember who answered the phone but it was a guy and I told him my insurance had told me they were having a rental set up through them and all this guy got quiet for a few seconds and said    ok? And then I asked if it was ok to get the car and he told me there are none available and that he doesnt know when hell have any rentals very rudely  HELLO ISNT IT YOUR JOB TO KNOW WHEN CARS ARE GOING TO BE GOING IN AND OUT OF THERE you guys should have times when a car will be returned or you just too lazy to look it up on the computer thats in front of you! Ridiculous ,?
2134844,I had great mushrooms and octopus  The service was also excellent  I appreciated the staffs menu experience as Id never been here before  The salt tray is to be respected!,?
2135102,I had heard a lot about the Avalon Exchange so when I found myself in Squirrel Hill  I had to take a peek  They have a pretty good selection of clothing and accessories for the teens  20s  30s crowd  including designer and name brands  I saw quite a few pairs of cute shorts I wish I had the time to try on  The prices are more than good will  but this store is more of a specialty thrift shop than good will and has a better selection  so i expected to see higher prices  They also had a great selection of sunglasses which I could appreciate because I always seem to lose  scratch  or break mine so its nice to know I can get stylish ones here on the cheap ,?
2135344,I had heard about the steak here being great for a while so finally decided to go  Definitely worth it! I had the Spencer steak and we shared a few different small plates to start with  Everything had a great taste and the meat seemed to be excellent quality  The staff were very friendly and attentive and I would definitely recommend this place ,?
2136505,I had high expectations and Mac king did not deliver  I thought maybe its because its a family show and there were no adult jokes that I wasnt entertained but I went to the Nathan burton show (also a family show) and was highly entertained  It just seemed like the mac king show were cheap tricks that little kids would be amused by  The only good parts were the bear and the beer acts  You can tell they put a lot more effort in the Nathan burton show AND the admission costs less  Sure I paid $16 with a coupon for mac king (tix drink and taxes) and that was admission with a well drink but the drink was so watered down they might as well just given me cranberry juice  I paid $10 for just the admission for the Nathan burton show but I was so happy with insane magic tricks mr burton performed that I wouldve paid $20 (if I had to) ,?
2136617,I had high expectations for Tex Tubbs based on the reviews I read and the menu I reviewed prior to my visit  but unfortunately it didnt deliver more than your average taco joint  There were a few moments where I questioned other reviews: 1  Upon ordering the Mexican corn which read that it would come in 4 small cobbs  the server placed a bowl on our table with 4 spoons (we were a group of 4 men)  I took it upon myself to find 3 additional bowls to split it up  2  Our taco dinners were supposed to included our choice of two sides  but we were never prompted to choose and when the plates came out they only included the tacos  3  And the most amazing thing of all  they charge 4 99 for chips and salsa! 4 99! The food was OK  I recommend the fish tacos  but the whole experience left me not interested to return ,?
2137352,I had high hopes for this noodle place from reviews of its authentic tasting noodles  We ordered the house beef noodle and hot and sour noodle  Hot and sour noodle stock was lacking in flavor  not at all spicy   The beef stew was delicious  but not spicy either   Service was mediocre at best with non smiling waiters meandering around   Not really worth the trip off the Strip ,?
2138358,I had just a few requests while visiting Montreal and bagels was at the top of the list  On Sunday morning I dragged my gluten free traveling companion Crystal H to Fairmount  so I could get a bagel before leaving this lovely city Crystal was a good sport and stood in line with me even though she couldnt indulge in a bagel herself  Fortunately the line moved pretty fast and minutes later I was sitting outside on a bench enjoying not 1  but 2 warm sesame bagels  Mmmm  I enjoyed them the good old fashioned Montreal way dipping them in a tiny tub of Philadelphia cream cheese  They were so good that I contemplated bringing some home for the family  but realized Id probably just eat the entire bag on the plane   Ill just have to take the fam back to Montreal with me soon we can enjoy some more good bagels ,?
2139127,I had lunch at Twin Peaks in Scottsdale  The waitress (Nichole) helped me decide from the menu  Great Food and Nichole provided great Service  I will definately go back to enjoy  And by the way  the scenery isnt bad either ,?
2140043,I had mabo ramen and it didnt taste well to be honest  Ive had better ramen elsewhere ,?
2140646,I had my Lasik done on Saturday  So far  so good  with minimal issues  I had some dryness and blurriness for the first three days  which is normal and to be expected  After that  things cleared up and now Im very happy with my vision  I would recommend Lasik of Nevada ,?
2140857,I had my belly button pierced for a few years and then I went to bmt for the air force and it closed up  I asked corn to repierce it through the same hole and he failed to do so  I noticed when I got home called him and he said he chose not to do it because it would be painful  I said I didnt care about the pain you should have done what I asked so he said I could come back in and hed do it through my old pericing would be more painful but hed do it  I went in two days ago he pierced it then I got home and once again it wasnt in the right spot  I called and he denied it and was no help  Never trust corn if he says hell do something the way you want it ,?
2141872,I had my first brazilian wax in years at Julias  She was friendly and kind and took me in early even though i mixed up my appointment time  The best partshe was fast and as painless as it could possibly be! I will definitely go back ,?
2142457,I had my first visit with Dr  Dameron last week and I really enjoyed my visit  The office is clean and the staff is very professional  I had my teeth cleaned by a hygienist who was very attentive to my sensitive teeth and Im thankful to her for not sending me through the ceiling  I accidentally left my insurance card at the office and was called by the office to let me know and they sent it back to me in the mail  They followed up with me to ensure I had a good visit and they havent bothered me since  All in all  it was a very enjoyable dentist visit  I would encourage anyone to go there ,?
2143579,I had my sons birthday here in January! I had the best time and my son had an amazing experience  (Sorry its late but idk if my phone was acting up or what it barely let me write this review now lol)Anyways  the owner is freaking amazing! He kept checking on us to make sure everything was good! Him and my dad talked for awhile also  it was like we were all family celebrating  I was so nervous for this because other places I had a bad experience  but not here! My son still talks about his birthday to this day and how he wants to go back just to play! Thank you for an amazing time,?
2144212,I had never been here before and the barista helped me pick an Amazing iced caramel soy latte  It was delicious and he was super friendly  The atmosphere carries good tunes and a cool casual atmosphere  :) ,?
2144326,I had never been there so wasnt really sure how to order or what to do  I felt rushed by the people working there and they were pretty rude  But the bagels and the homemade matzo were good!,?
2144827,I had never experienced belly dancing or a belly dancing workout in my life so I no idea what to expect  I contracted Gaby sight unseen for a womens group exercise class  I had 25 women of all ages and abilities that were expecting      well  something other than belly dancing  What we got was a wonderful mix of belly dancing  Bollywood and most of all an exhaustive full body workout  What a pleasant surprise  I highly recommend Gaby  her energy  expertise  professionalism and most of all  fun!,?
2145366,I had never stayed here before and I must say for the money its a great deal   We went for a weekend in March and had a great stay   The entry of the hotel is very nice  the individual oil lamp lookalikes at each guest check in desk were a nice touch   Personally I liked on each level how theres a center lobby right off the elevator with 4 different hallways to go down for your room   its nothing spectacular but for some reason I really liked it The rooms are pretty nice  definitely nicer than a lot of the hotels in a similar price range    Im thinking that we got a good price because we went 2 months after the fire that occurred there    no concern to me Everytime I venture to Vegas I never really get to enjoy the pools and other commodities at the hotel  of course this trip was no different though Im sure they were great The service at the hotel was exquisite  I definitely recommend it  ,?
2147241,I had only gotten dim sum one time before this one  and sadly  it was not the business   When my friends called me up to meet up here  I was hesitant  but figured  why the hell not? :]  It ended up being a very good passive decision The place was packed  but service moved very quickly   Everyone was picking and choosing and pulling things off of carts    it was great   I got to try a lot of things for the first time  including something with shrimp and rice paper  (yeah  lots of foreign names that I have no idea how to say  nor spell)   Everything was also very reasonably priced   I think that the most expensive thing was 3 75  but there were so many of us that we all got our full for under $10 each  :] Overall  it was a really good experience  the customer service was super and the food was really good!,?
2147264,I had only one sandwich there  the fanatic or something: an abomination of food  and is so good  Just dont plan on doing much afterwards :),?
2147885,I had pretty much every burger in almost every restaurant  this one of the one of the best Sunnyside burger and truffle fries I ever had and the service felt like a five star restaurantand    I applaud the management for training  their staff  very very well hats off to a server Carlos great experience thank you,?
2148768,I had really bad stains on my carpet and they did a great job at getting them out ,?
2150693,I had somewhat high hopes  and I like their logo  the building and the restaurant design  The service was a bit odd  the server seemed confused  and they were out of some drinks and food  We pushed on and each had a bowl of ramen  mine was pork based with garlic and kimchi  similar to what Ive had on Honshu near Korea  It was OK  and certainly nothing like authentic  The edamame was above average  Worried about their survival as Arizona needs ramen shops of every quality ,?
2150716,I had spaghetti my husband had chicken & mashed potatoes  Very good waitress  Friendly staff & timely  Family style resturant ,?
2150830,I had stopped at another location that was not open  after being disappointed I tossed in the health towel and decided to go get some Donuts   I searched my Yelp app for the next spot  I was excited to see a Jamba Juice in the parking lot and made the choice to be healthy Service was great and friendly  Products as expected Quality yum face was applied after first tasting Thank you keep up the good work,?
2150992,I had such a fun time when I visited Drais  The cocktail staff was amazing and so beautiful  The whole club was absolutely beautiful as well  They had a really good vibe going on and the whole experience was very enjoyable   my new hot spot in town for sure!,?
2151596,I had such an amazing experience at brazwells! The drinks were on point  food was amazing  but better than all else was the superior service  Darienne was an amazing bartender and so attentive  The front of house manager  Megan  was such a pleasure and so helpful  Amazing staff all around  Will be back!,?
2152861,I had the BEST time at Pure! First of all  if you want to get into any club make sure you look classy  Sencond  only get V I P passes from club promoters near the vicinity of the club  DONT PAY FOR A PASS Third  if you dont get in with the pass its probably because you got a fake one  you are dressed terrible  or you are gross My friend and I werent even inside the Ceasers palace for more than 10 seconds and we were offered a V I P pass from one of the club promoters  We got into Pure with no wait and no problem  When we got in it turned out to be a special event and the club was promoting the new Hennessey Black  We got free drinks the whole night and we got seriously CRUNK  The atmosphere was awesome  the drinks were great  and music was bumpin! I had a blast! The people inside were all beautiful and I had the best time! If you are a girl and you want to be in a classy club Pure is the place to be!,?
2153056,I had the BurgerFi burger  fries and onion rings  The burgers are not huge but they are big enough  Burger was very good  Lots of choices on the menu  especially for fries  Onion rings are HUGE and the best I have had in a long time  You get a massive quantity of fries  beware when ordering! They have two freestyle machines  which I appreciate  since just one can be annoying in a busy place like this  Service was great on a Sunday  They have draft beers and wine  Overall  pricey but I felt it is worth a treat on occasion  I shall return!,?
2153518,I had the French Dip and vegetable soup  It was very good  Service was fast and friendly   Will have to come back and try desert ,?
2153941,I had the Lan Zhou noodle soup that everyone is talking about  and it was memorable  The hand pulled noodles were perfect and had a great bite  the beef was a good addition  and the broth was amazing  unlike anything Ive ever had  The broth is really what makes this dish  its somewhat similar to Pho but with a deeper spice and star anise flavor  An hour after you eat this soup youll still be thinking about it  And if you catch the luch special its only $6 95! Cant beat that deal for a great bowl of soup  Looking forward to coming back and trying some dumplings in chilli oil ,?
2154229,I had the PH dog and must have used 100 napkins  It was good but very difficult to eat and messy  I thought the onion rings were average but good  Nothing to really write home about  I think next time I will go with a basic dog so I can eat it with my hands like you are suppose to eat a hot dog ,?
2154329,I had the Pho here and for the pricetaste ratio for the Pho  Its terrible  If it was cheaper  it would be better  Then again  its the Venetian  Everything is expensive  I would stay away from this place unless you love spending money for overpriced food ,?
2154675,I had the St  Louis Spareribs that were dry rubbed with their secret blend and they were perfect  I didnt have to add any bbq sauce  The cornbread was delicious and the beans were delicious  My husband had the B E  Sammie which is brisket burnt ends on a toasted roll and he loved it  I cant wait to go back to Tuckys  If they deliver to Lake Mead  I will definitely have them cater my parties on my houseboat  My only regret was not knowing about them prior  We drive from California on the weekends  Thanks to the kind and friendly staff; they know their bbq ,?
2154824,I had the Tonkonsu Ramen Mild Spicy  added egg  flying fish roe and black garlic oil  The Ramen and the soup taste really good  Its my first time there and I love it  Service is great  Will definitely go back next time ,?
2155059,I had the absolute worse experience at this office  Dr Kian was so rude and condescending  I had to leave in the middle of my appointment in tears  I cant believe a doctor would be that awful to a patient!,?
2156169,I had the best pedicure here  They had a lot of colors to choose from and the salon was super clean  The staff was very friendly and really took their time ,?
2156763,I had the butter coffee from Hula Girl at the CNE  Disgusting taste  Way overpriced  I still havent gotten over the price  $6 for a medium coffee  The worst combination  Just because they add a bunch of fancy sounding organic this and local that doesnt mean it tastes good  And it was $6 for a regular  terrible  oily  plain coffee ,?
2156880,I had the carrot salad  it was different for me  The oysters were already seasoned and ready to eat  perfect! I also had the blackened bass  it was just perfect  topped it off with a Grace 2007  Sommelier was professional as was our waiter  asked if we had time constraints right off the bat! They also have a professional photographer! We took advantage of her services  it was a nice touch  Live music in the bar area to continue your night  Romantic ambiance ,?
2157157,I had the chicken and waffles  It was only $5 or so which was nice  A side of mac and cheese was like $3 or something  The chicken and waffles were pretty good for the price  If I lived around here  I would eat here more often ,?
2157537,I had the chocolate peanut butter & German chocolate cupcakes  They were the best I have ever tasted  The cake was moist & soft  The frostings on the cupcakes were perfectly delicious  Best in town!!!! Im going back for the other flavors  I also had the Nutella macaron it was a bit small but full of satisfaction ,?
2157724,I had the country fried steak while hubby got a gigantic omelette of some sort  Yeah the servings were huge  Service was pretty great  Food was ok ,?
2158256,I had the fish and chips and for the $30 it wasnt any better than a Red Robin version at $14  Those werent chips they were sad American steak fries  Waiter was pretty rude and dismissive about our stroller  Im from the UK and feel like I should have just gone to Gordons fish and chips where it was 12 bucks for what I paid 30 for ,?
2158423,I had the fried chicken with yams and Mac and cheese  The Mac and cheese was watery and tasted like pepper  the yams had no taste and the fried chicken was ok  I went there around the time they opened and the owner was there and the food was great but the woman was there that time and the food was so not good  Not real soul food    KFC is better ,?
2158509,I had the giant philly sub and it was hot and tasty  I was hungry and it filled me up  Plenty of help and only a fiveminute wait  A little pricy at $14 02 including tax ,?
2159283,I had the lobster poutine for poutine week  I know this is a special dish I expected it to be specially good  It was the most inedible poutine Ive ever had  The lobster bits were tiny and most definitely frozen  They had a disgusting watery taste to them  The gravy was barely warm and lumpy  Probably from a can  Because the fries were so thin  they got soggy from the crappy gravy and watery lobster  It was like I was eating potato spaghetti  It also really doesnt help when the waiter is trying to rush you out when there was barely anyone in the restaurant  Never coming back ,?
2159430,I had the macadamia nut milk latte and it was fantastic! Pour Cleveland is a cute small coffee shop  with high quality coffee and no frills  The decor is minimalist and would make a great place to bring your laptop or a good book and relax for an afternoon  They also serve bagels and doughnuts from local bakeries  In addition to serving coffee  they have a nice assortment of items for sale  including coffee mugs  tshirts and pour overs ,?
2159778,I had the most amazing experience with this dealership  Jack Serena worked really hard to get me a lower finance rate than we originally had discussed and I was very pleased! Sandy Mitchell was very friendly and sweet  She made the experience very easy and stress free  No one was pushy at all  and I got exactly what I wanted without anxiety or anything ,?
2159846,I had the most awful experience in this store today I walked in with my boyfriend with a piece of art that I needed framed and was greeted by one woman who just started at us (she clearly had absolutely no idea what was going on)  We said that we needed to have something framed  and she looked to another woman working in the store who proceeded to look at us and say I wont be able to help you for at least 15 minutes  That was all  We stood there  a little shocked and said  Ok     I guess well go and she just turned back to what she was doing I still cant believe how poorly we were treated  I would definitely not recommend this framer  How stores can think that they can treat customers in that manner and get away with it is completely beyond me I ended up going to Soho Art Custom Framing (about 5 mins away) and they were fantastic!,?
2160577,I had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas! They were honestly the best pizzas Ive ever had!! Highly recommend the baked potato you wont be disappointed!,?
2160798,I had the philly steak sandwich and it sucks big time  tried to get chili cheese fries and at noon time they were out of chili  If you want a very good philly cheese sandwich go down the street to Decatur and Alta because POPS philly steaks are a 1000 times better then this place any day of the week ,?
2160852,I had the pizza and I had the meatball sandwich  One of the most amazing meatball sandwiches Ive had  Pizza was really good too  From the cheese to the sauce  it was good  Kids had chicken strips  I tried one piece  also really good  I recommend for anyone looking for some good Italian food!,?
2160962,I had the pleasure of being served by Jon Chazen  He was extremely Knowledgeable about his in store merchandise and Giorgio Armani Lines in general  He took great care of me  eventhough I didnt need another Armani suit  Jon was great at making me feel special and welcome  I ended up purchasing a beautiful navy blue suit   Jon keep up the great work  and keep up the great customer service  because that make or break the deal  You are a Class Act ,?
2161259,I had the pleasure of finding this place due to the location  (its down the street from my job ) I LOVE the environment and how sweet the employees are  I always get the #2 street noodle and its just the right portion for the price  Please be aware of the spice levels  they dont kid with it ,?
2162166,I had the privilege of working with Danny throughout the process  Danny came out and conducted the initial consultation as well as getting the measurements for the sunscreens  Once we decided to move forward with All Pro Shade Concepts  the process was very smooth and I was always kept in touch with about what was going on  Brian came out on the day of installation and was completed within an hour with the sunscreens looking great on the house  Thanks Danny and Brian for your excellent customer experience throughout the process!!!!,?
2162410,I had the ribs which may be a poor choice for an Italian restaurant and my wife had shrimp also probably a bad choice    The service was good and the place is nice   Unfortunately I was starving and I left that way   The food on that night was not very tasty   I couldnt make it past the second rib it had some thick nasty sauce and a sliver of meat   My wife offered me her shrimp and that was worse she couldnt eat it and neither could I   We ordered a desert to try and get full and wow was that tasteless   Maybe they got a new cook who cant   I wish we had went to Olive Garden or even McDonalds instead because I felt robbed   I went home and ate a sandwich and chips to fill up   Sorry for the review but it was just that bad ,?
2162922,I had the shrimp tacos  my niece had the El GreenGo Burrito  They charge for chips and salsa    and for me anyone who charges for chips and salsa is lame  Im from houston and we have the best mexican/texmex food around  so as far as the food goes its just 2 stars for me The shrimp tacos were good  but just ok  same with the rice and beans  Ive had better  Too many other great food places in vegas to spend money here  My niece said her food was good  but also mediocre  probably wouldnt be a repeat for me  The staff was very nice  that was probably the best part of the experience  That is all  :),?
2162953,I had the simple breakfasts with bacon the potatoes were old and dry  the bacon a little over cooked for my liking  the biscuit and gravy were ok overall I give it a below ok meal  I should mention that the portions are huge & Great Customer service!! soo you decide!,?
2163080,I had the southwest crispy chicken sandwich and my husband had the bacon cheeseburger  Both were SO good! My husband claims that the burger is one of the best burgers he has eaten in Las Vegas  The chicken sandwich was delicious and had great flavor  The buns were so fresh and really made the sandwich  Both meals came with Parmesan fries delish!  overall  a great food truck!,?
2163328,I had the strange experience of spending two successive nights in the ER here  first with my son and then for myself   Both times  the staff were efficient  knowledgeable and almost exclusively personable (the one nurse who sped away  expecting me to follow on an injured leg was the exception)  I am confident that we both received excellent care  waits were not excessive  I could not have wished for a better ER experience ,?
2164414,I had the worst experience here  I was at self checkout and realized a lipstick I wanted didnt have a bar code  The rude older Mexican lady working took it from me instead of having a runner get a new one  (Thats what they do in the south ) Anyways she started off rude and told me to hurry up because she had other customers  I told her that I had just got there to go tell everyone else at self checkout to be faster  She was so rude the security guy came and asked me if she was harrassing me   I have not been back there  People like that shouldnt get away with that shit  I spoke with a manager but doubt anything was done ,?
2167502,I had to make time out of my busy schedule to write a review well deserved for Raul aka Dr  Blonde  I feel blessed to have met him as a person and as my new hairstylist  This guy is a good person inside and out  In addition this guy has been blessed with a true calling for converting brunette hair into stunning blonde hair  His skill and talent speaks volumes on his technique on transforming hair  He made me feel beautiful inside and out during a difficult time in my life of a breakup with a boyfriend  I will never want to lose this amazing person as a friend and now my new hairstylist  Thank You Raul for enhancing my beauty during a sad time in my life ,?
2168775,I had to wait way too long to order a sandwich  I waited at the bar for at least 5 minutes before being recognized by a person at the bar to place my order   After placing the order I waited 20 plus minutes for a sandwich  cmon a sandwich please ,?
2169596,I had very good experience with Tanya who was so friendly and personable  She took the time to do research for my unusual situation and found the answer  She was able to help me get the refund I didnt know I have!! Awesome service!,?
2170482,I hadnt been here in a very long time  but was eager to swing by the last time I was in town   The burger and cheese curds were good  but not as good as I had remembered   The food probably sat out for a bit  because it wasnt very warm   As expected  they were slammed  so I just ate it without making a fuss   Definitely worth trying!,?
2170525,I hadnt been here in so long  had totally forgotten about this place until just a few weeks ago when my fatherinlaw suggested it for dinner for the four of us  It had been awhile since I had been here  but it was fantastic We enjoyed our few hours on the patio  in no rush  I had a great white wine and the boys enjoyed their beers  I actually ordered just the chips with blue cheese for my meal since I was in the mood for something to munch on and it was perfect  And I ate every last chip  Awesome Hopefully Ill be back again soon and not wait a few years for my next meal here  Its a great place!,?
2170836,I hadnt been to a Chilis in a while and the service was amazing (even though we had a large party) and the food was very good  The appetizers we ordered were all good  the chips and drinks were refilled quickly  and our main courses were very good  too! Id definitely go back ,?
2171168,I hadnt gone here in years  I remembered when it first opened and I thought this place was amazing  Then the last time I went here it felt average at best  But not this time  it reminded me of when it first opened  Yummy steam buns  delicious sandwich  and some yummy meat pastries  They added shrimp/pork veggie rolls  I recommend going close to when they open  the food seems the freshest then ,?
2171662,I happened to be at The Arizona Center shopping for clothes and decided it would be more convenient to stop in for a gel fill and pedicure rather than drive out of my way to my normal salon  Unfortunately  I regret this decision  At first they had me sit down at a table for my fill  but they began speaking to each other in Chinese then had me move to get a pedicure with the same person (not sure what the confusion was)? The massage was just ok  nothing special  but I did enjoy the vast amount of color choices  I was most disappointed that my 2nd toe had nail polish that wiped off after 3 days and now I have a chip in my middle finger that keeps snagging on everything  If I pay to have my nails done  I expect they stay on for 1 1/2 2 weeks  I definitely wont be going back ,?
2171707,I happened to be in Scottsdale on business and I was really happy when I found out there was a Four Peaks in the area   I frequented the Tempe location when I lived in the area so this was a real pleasant surprise   In any case  we landed at 10:30 and made a bline to the bar before retiring for the night   We arrived an instantly things got even better    late night happy hour    awesome   We grabbed some pretzels to soak up the beer   They might be the best pretzels Ive ever had   Throw in the great beer and service and you have someplace with a little soul in the midst of the urban sprawl Im glad to see the Four Peaks folks doing well enough to expand ,?
2172570,I hate Mill Ave because its trendy and often overpriced for the college scene  but we happened to be down town and stopped for a quick beer or two and bite to eat The view upstairs on the patio is to die for Our server was SO WONDERFUL and friendly  If the staff reads these reviews  please give kudos to the tall southern boy who knows his beers! I wish I could remember his name  So sweet and on top of refills and he really knows how to read a table He pointed out so many things on the menus about the food  beer  specials  etc  hes what made us decide to order some appetizers and everything was hot and delicious We will be back because of his service first  but the great beers and appetizers also  We want to try happy hour next ,?
2173450,I hate having to go to the post office  I appreciate that this office had one person talking to people in line and assisting in deciding which services are best  She wrote it down on a slip to make it easy for the register to just punch in  Im used to lines  lines  lines and it made it efficient enough that I wasnt ready! I was still writing labels  I rarely go  but I like that I dont spend an hour at this location so Ill be back again ,?
2174471,I hate this place so much  Because I live in L A   and their burgers are so great I never want to have another burger from anywhere else  ever again! I ate dinner there Sunday night before heading home  took two burgers togo  had one for lunch today at work and the other four dinner tonight! Yeah  that good! Fantastic burgers  and the shakes are out of this world!! Guaranteed this will be the best burger youve ever had in your life  Yeah  Im THAT sure!Good value  exquisite cuisine  and excellent service!,?
2174765,I hate to be a broken record  but like the other Reviews this is beyond a delightful experience in more ways then one  From the interaction  to the food  the taste  the atmosphere  Truly an enjoyable dinning experience that exceeded all expectations  I highly recommend this place to anyone with good taste   8/18/2016,?
2175463,I hate to give five stars so easily but this is the best gyros and falafel sandwiches in the city  Very good food  comes fast at a good price and the owner smaller husky man is very nice guy  All around good location if you want food from Middle East/Medditarannean  I would recommend to anyone interested,?
2177333,I have A LOT of hair  Most people Ive gone to are shocked and/or overwhelmed with the amount of hair I have  It takes someone with talent and patience to handle my hair and Lyndsay was all that and more! She knew what she was doing and I was amazed with how my hair ended up  I will never go anywhere else  Lyndsay for life ,?
2178700,I have a confession to make        the thing I like most about Maxs is their bread!!! They are free    they are fresh made    hot and soft   different kinds    and so so delicious!Im not a big fan of German food  but its just my personal taste  The portions are large and atmosphere is very relaxing and casual  I like it ,?
2179007,I have a feeling some of the initial poor reviews that were released  were due to growing pains  as it happens with lots of new restaurants  I think theres even been some shift in management and staff  I had a wonderful experience at Bin 86 The ambiance was relaxed and comfortable  The staff was very friendly and accommodating  The food was tasty and served promptly and they had a nice selection of quality wines  My guest and I ordered a selection of meats and cheeses  which were presented very delicately  followed by some Bruscetta and beef skewers  None of the food disappointed  I also got to have a really great conversation with one of the managers  Matt  about his history in the wine business while we sampled some delicious Reds and dessert wine If youve been here before and had a bad experience  Id recommend giving it a second try  and if you havent been  you should check it out!,?
2179460,I have a hard time giving somebody less than three stars  and realistically I would have liked to give them like two and a half  They gave me the equipment that I ordered  told me how to set it up  and pushed me out the door  Really unfriendly strange feeling that I got from the staff there  Seems like they really hate their job ,?
2180722,I have a pizza problem  I like pizza and i like it lots of ways  this is the only place the gets it the New York way  That fold is so perfect  Ive tried so many things here to list em all  If its pizza you can get it  I dont go to a pizza place for anything else  The wings are good had the pasta once but the pizza has my love ,?
2180737,I have a poster that is extremely oversized that I wanted to be laminated so that I could hang it  Bill and Brenda did everything that they could to make it work  and my print is the most awesome work that I could have imagined  The customer service provided was top notch and truly as good as it gets  I had a very pleasant experience working with SpeedPro  I would not hesitate to do business with them again or refer anyone needing printing services ,?
2182366,I have always been a fan of these cakes  especially the red velvet (which I dont generally like) and the white chocolate raspberry  The week of Thanksgiving I sampled the pumpkin spice and liked it  So I picked one up a few days before the holiday and was assured it would be fresh for Thanksgiving  On Thanksgiving  it was a little dry and mostly went uneaten  When I went by the store to mention it a few weeks later  the owner  Rocky  came out to talk to me  He was polite and friendly and was genuinely concerned that the cake was less than I expected  He assured me that on my next trip in to the store  he would make things right  and made sure that my information was in the cash register/computer  Im looking forward to the next occasion when one of their cakes will be called for ,?
2185356,I have attended at least 3 trips with Short Trips and have thoroughly enjoyed each one  Sash is very friendly and the most organized organizer  No detail is overlooked on any trip  I have also attended 2 trips with Anna Maria as our host/director  she is friendly and engaging and so enthusiastic! I will admit that I have attended bus trips offered by other companies but none can compare to Short Trips in terms of venues/locations  pricing and organization  I wish I could attend more of these trips but the small matter of work gets in the way  lol  I will definitely check out their calendar of upcoming events and encourage you to do the same  there is something for everyone!,?
2186888,I have been a customer for years   They have some of the most classy and professional staff EVER :)  I deal with Maria who  even on the phone when I order that way is the BEST ! I have to say this is one company that actually CARES about their customers   The quality of their boots is the best as well  They are made well as they last   Selection  style and color is absolutely exceptional   Frankly I do not even bother going into any shoe stores except for this one  I trust the workmanship and the quality   I was first turned onto this store by my highschool teacher in 1982 !!  She raved about how good Arnold Churgin is and always told us that they are high quality   They have excellent sales and again the service is 200 PERCENT !!  Cant wait to check out their spring and summer stuff :),?
2187597,I have been a fan of Lisas Rum Cake for a very long time and have tried a few different flavors including the rumfetti  original rum cake  and a fresh fruit customized cake I requested about 6 years ago  They were all delicious! The last time I came the staff working there were very polite and helped me carry the cake to my car since it was large and heavy  They are always beautifully decorated and fresh tasting  Also  you can tell they use quality rum  They are pricey and it will likely cost you over $75 for a decent sized cake  but it is worth it for the right occasion ,?
2188176,I have been a long time patient to Dr Kennedy and would never consider another chiropractor for my needs  He and his staff are always flexible and accommodate me when I  NEED  to get in  and the whole office genuinely cares  He treats my entire family and I wouldnt have it any other way  The best part is  he has two offices that are near me so no matter what day I need to get in  its not a problem  Even Saturday  I couldnt ask for a better or more caring doctor ,?
2189455,I have been a patient here for over 10 years   I changed from a prominent optometrist because of having to wait for over an hour for my scheduled appointment for EVERY appointment   I found Dr Tammy Hawks when her office was near me on Park Road  and have followed her to her current Monroe Road location   First of all  NO waiting for appointment   Friendly and welcoming staff   Great office hours for working people   Dr Tammy has all modern equipment and I feel that I get a very thorough exam   She alerts me to any problems to watch for as I age   I have referred many friends and family here and everyone is happy   I highly recommend this practice and Dr Hawks ,?
2189523,I have been a patient of Cornerstone Womens Care since I moved to AZ in 1999  Dr  Lance Holeman is fantastic  The NPs are wonderful and caring  especially Gretchen  And when Dr  Holeman stopped taking new pregnancy patients  I absolutely loved Dr  Castro  She was actually pregnant the same time I was  She also filled in for my first babys delivery because Dr   Holeman was out of town  For anyone who complains about seeing an NP  please realize that they just as qualified to see you and the doctors oversee all patient documents to make sure things are going right  And the gal at the front desk is so pleasant to people who come in the door or call on the phone  even when it seems things are running behind (which does happen in a doctors practice ),?
2189842,I have been a patient of Dr  Stuckey for almost 19 years   He is a wonderful   thorough dentist   Hes caring and takes the time to explain any questions I may have   Sonja has been my primary hygienist and shes amazing   as is every other hygienist I have interacted with   If you want the best dental care in Charlotte  I highly recommend Dr  Stuckey and his team!,?
2189899,I have been a patient of JoEllen Embry for many years!! I can not say enough wonderful things about her    she really cares and shows it by spending time with her patients really getting to know who they are!! I have never been to another healthcare provider that has done that    most are in and out and make you feel like just another body She is so REAL she has become a friend    she also sees my sister and we both love her!!!!!,?
2190728,I have been a very frequent visitor to this library with my kids for 7 years   The staff is great here  My kids love all the things there are to do here   computers  games  puzzles  coloring  magazines  looking at books  movie days and great summer activities  Its nice to have a free activity to do with the kids that they enjoy and I can get a little quiet reading time in as well!,?
2191187,I have been at this place 3 times and every time they do not disappoint me  my favorites from the menu are the shit  monkey brains  towering poke chips and wet dreams ,?
2191347,I have been away from Southern AZ for many years and in my heart it is still home  I live in New England now and the selection of quality Mexican restaurants is slim  While traveling to Phoenix this week for business  I had the pleasure of dining at Serranos Mexican Food  It brought me back home  Its rustic homestyle Sonoran Mexican food and decor was what my spirit needed  I enjoyed the mini sample platter  a Carne Asada chimichanga with a nice Negra Modela to wash it down  The server  Cathy  was friendly and helpful in making my selection (20% tip)  The food was served hot and the portions more than satisfying  Their house salsa had just the right amount of heat was the perfect condiment for this huge bowl of fresh made tortilla chips  Definitely worth a revisit while I am here and is one of my favorites when I return ,?
2191420,I have been back here multiple times since my previous review  not by choice   Each experience has been well below average   Everything from the service to the food at this place makes me wonder how they are still open at this point  My most recent trip was for a lunch   The place was not crowded   We asked for a minute to decide on our order   The server really took this to heart because he did not come back to check on our table for about 15 minutes   I ordered the fat cat burger and fries   The burger was overcooked and barely even warm by the time it got to me   The flavor was below average and you could not taste much other than the special sauce they use   I have never had a burger here that was juicy or came out anywhere close to hot   On top of that  the french fries they use are incredibly generic looking   They are the equivalent of McDonalds fries With so many good burger places in the downtown Pittsburgh area  do not waste a meal on this place ,?
2191464,I have been back to Angels Trumpet quite a few times since my original visit and they continue to improve!! The waitstaff has been very helpful and friendly  and although they (understandly) cant speak with authority about all of their beers  they were always willing to get me one of the owners  who are beer gurus  to answer my questions   I finally got to try a sour/wild beer on tap!! The weather is so nice this time of year  and I love it when they have their big garage door open  which also helps the sound level quite a bit  The homemade poptart is a fantastic  fluffly  baked puffed pastry with delicious filling and cream cheese frosting  think a gormet toaster strudle   The ketchup is very interesting since it is made inhouse and its nice to actually taste that tomato flavor   I NEED to try their fluffernutter (peanut butter  marshmall fluff) next ,?
2192181,I have been coming and ordering from here for 2 years and I have to say it is one of the best Pizza places in the valley  The cheese  sauce  and crust is always fresh  We love the service and they are always nice over the phone and in person  It is very tasteful and not salty like Dominos or Pizza Hunt in some occasions  This place had very good wings bone and boneless  The antipasto is always fresh and very tasty along with their amazing canolis!,?
2192308,I have been coming here every single time I am in Vegas  I once waited by myself for around one hour just to eat here  I always order the miso ramen soup   The other day I ordered fried rice to go and both the soup and the rice were both delicious! While I havent really tried the other broths  the miso one they have which I guess is as close to tonkotsu as it can be is 10/10   My only suggestion would be to improve their eggs  While I had never had any problems before  the last time I was there  the egg was slightly overcooked If you are in a hurry  you can call ahead and order food for pick up  They are super efficient btw ,?
2192434,I have been coming here for 5 years and they are the BEST! Ben  Justin  Zach  Jason  and Brian all take great care of me  I purchased my Trek Madone 6 series there a couple of years ago and they were very helpful and gave me great advice when I was ordering my new bike  They were patient with me while I figured out my paint scheme  They dont over sell on the bike or service side  They provide great value for your dollar  No matter how much money you spend  you are treated great! They are not there just to sell expensive bikes  They are very much in the community and of the community ,?
2192780,I have been coming here for about 13 years and I am a huge fan  Though the actual restaurant/ decor might throw some people off  the food is fantastic and the portions are large for the money you are paying  The main waitress always recognizes us and is extremely friendly ,?
2192877,I have been coming here for about a year now  and windy is my absolute favorite person  She is a straight up nail magician  Not only is she super creative and willing to do anything I ask  shes also incredible at her job  My nails are always flawless  and she is such a lovely person  If she ever moves  I am likely going to cut my nails off and wear gloves until I die because no one will ever compare to her  If shes not your nail lady  what are you doing with your life?,?
2193463,I have been coming here for the last 3 years  ever since I moved to this area  All of the nail techs are amazing  James and Stephanie are my top two go to people  The owner Sam and his wife do a great job running the place and making sure everything is perfect  Everyone is so friendly  and the price is what you would expect for a nail shop of this caliber  If you want a $20 full set from a chop shop  this is not the place for you ,?
2193738,I have been coming here for years and this has been my favorite place in lv   Wheels came off last night  bad food  poor service  so dissapointing   Ordered bone in filet  medium   Cut into it and it was purple  np big deal sent it back   Steak came out later  now red  waiter sort of argued with me about it which was unusual as mastros usually has great service  sent it back again   Now of course it comes out well done   Manager comes by  listens to me takes it off bill and comps dessert   Nice but still poor dinner at a place i have always considered bullet proof   People i ate with liked their food  but it was not a good experience for me ,?
2193861,I have been coming here for years! They always can book me when I am desperate for an appointment  Than and Henry are miracle workers!,?
2194278,I have been coming here since I can remember  They have absolutely the best hot dogs in the world and their quality has never changed  Yes  its a bit pricey for hot dogs and fries  but its so worth it in my opinion! The dogs are cooked till their skin is crispy and charred and their complimented with whatever topping suits your fancy  The service is quick  but still madetoorder and they staff is great  The ONLY thing that bugs me is when there are customers who have never been there and they do not know how to order  It gets on my nerves ,?
2194585,I have been coming here since this place opened and I know they have been sold but they still do a great all around job  Great Happy Hour and good consistent food served for lunch and dinners  Happy Hour has great food and drinks specials and gets pretty busy on Thurs and Friday A good spot to come if you are at the Fashion Square ,?
2194948,I have been coming to Dicks for the best weekend brunches since 1998!!! Yes folks  its true  My go to is their Enchiladas and Eggs combo  Simply the best New Mexican enchiladas ever in the state of Arizona  Aside from their food  their bloody marys are top notch  My favorite part about this is that they are super spicy with a beer chaser of your choice  Ive taken many friends here that have not had brunch at this place and everyone loves it ,?
2195291,I have been coming to Mars Uptown for many years now  and they have THE BEST corned beef hash I have ever had  No potatoes or filler  just delicious  seasoned beef  with great home fry potatoes  I was just there today with a friend  and introduced her to the corned beef hash  with eggs over easy  The eggs were cooked perfectly  Over the years  the food has always been very consistent  and great service too  A great  classic diner  love it here!,?
2195706,I have been coming to Yan Woo Soya ever since elementary school  I often wonder how this store is able to maintain the same price and quality for over ten years  $1 99 for original silken tofu pudding (tofufa in Chinese)  $2 45 for more unconventional flavours (such as sesame paste  walnut paste or almond paste with tofu pudding)  My favorite is coconut sango with tofu pudding  Smooth tofu sweetened by rich coconut milk with chewy tapioca pearls to enhance the overall texture of the dessert Perhaps it is nostalgia  perhaps it is my love for all things soy; Yan Woo Soya Bean has the best silken tofu dessert in Toronto  There is something comforting about smooth lightly sweetened silken tofu that not only warms your belly  but also you heart!,?
2196218,I have been coming to this gas station for years   One day I walk in and to make a long story short  the store manager basically showed me no respect   She had a bad attitude and a very nasty tone   So I emailed corporate and not only did they handle the situation but they offered me a gift card   I know its hard to find good people so I dont blame the company   Like I said  they took care of the problem so I will keep coming here with my business ,?
2196274,I have been coming to this location ever since it opened  Today was the last time  Not only have their prices gone way up; at the same time they are decreasing their services  For $20  I got a vacuum  wash  and tire polish; NOTHING on the interior  You used to at least have someone clean the interior windows and wipe down the dash  For $3  I could have vacuumed myself and driven my car through their wash  You would think with so many of these $3 car washes popping up all over  they would want to actually provide a quality service for the money they are charging  I had to tell them there was still bird poop on the roof  Guess its time to check out those $3 car washes!,?
2196426,I have been coming to this location quite a bit and never had an issue  I went today and they refused to take my Discover card because they dont accept it even though I have never had a problem in the past  AVOID THIS LOCATION IF YOU USE DISCOVER!,?
2196945,I have been coming to this shop for a few years now and absolutely love everything about it  I used to drive across town for their selection of freshwater fish and live plants  fortunately we moved and are right up the street now  I have a small reef tank and a new tortoise  the staff are very knowledgable across the board and have helped with educating me along the way Over the years I have had a few mishaps with purchases from the store (an opened chemiclean container and a bad batch of salt water) but the owners stepped up each time and made it right no questions asked  Price point is good staff and ownership are excellent and honest  livestock has always been healthy   what more could you ask for  Oh and there is a bonus  if you go on the weekends you will prob run into three of the cutest and sweetest golden retrievers around!,?
2197572,I have been dining here since this place opened  Recently returned after a long absence for Sunday Brunch and was extremely disappointed   Food was between cold and tepid  after I notified the waitress she went into the back and told me she told the head cook about the problem  At least a half hour later someone came out and checked the temp  Unfortunately he only checked 3 different items and seemed to care less  The foods that I found to be cold were from several areas  I heard several people asking to have their food heated  I expected better from Station Casinos  Cant justify returning  Too bad  used to be a good place to eat ,?
2197891,I have been driving past this gem on my way to the Waterfront for years  and Im so happy I finally made it inside  I had no idea that there was such a great place sitting there  and I was truly impressed The food is fantastic and the selection is pretty healthy and all natural  I also loved the beer selection  and the prices were great  The service at the bar was wonderful  and Im definitely going to make this a future grub stop at the Waterfront in the future!,?
2198012,I have been dying to try one of these escape room places  When we were in Scottsdale for my sisters bachelorette  we were able to find some time to try out Escape The Room AZ  We had originally signed up for a certain room on a particular night  but had to cancel last minute due to one of our friends not feeling well  Escape the Room AZ was very accommodating and we were able to reschedule for another day  We had five girls in our group and  thankfully  no one else signed up for our room  so we were able to escape the room on our own  We chose to do the apartment and were able to successfully escape  We definitely needed assistance though  so it was very helpful that we were given clues along the way! It was a lot of fun and Im looking forward to doing another escape room soon!,?
2198057,I have been dying to visit this place for awhile  Like since I turned 21  but the whole avoiding the strip thing kinda got in the way Anywho   I went on Saturday around lunch time and we had about a 15 minute wait  Not bad for the strip  We waited a good 10 minutes after we were seated for our server to come by  She recommended the Bahama Mama  which was awesome! It almost tasted like a 50/50 bar  but it had an interesting kick to it  We settled on the nachos for our entree  It looks huge  but I will say that 70% of the nachos is chips  They were still really tasty  and we had leftovers  We indulged and ordered dessert  the brownie  Its chocolate and ice cream  no point in reviewing that  Of course it was delicious!Overall  I really liked this place  I hope that I can convince one of my buds to join me soon ,?
2198659,I have been eating here for years  The employees are always nice and while the dining area can be hot (it is small and there is a GIANT pizza oven 10 ft away) it is a pretty relaxed environment  If youre a regular  they do recognize youwhich is rare  I havent been to their other location but this one is great ,?
2198877,I have been enjoying this restaurant for eight years  I love it that their food gets right to the point of being delicious! This spot is a cute little quaint restaurant that generates outstanding Italian food  My favorite is the vodka penne with sausage ,?
2198882,I have been enrolled in CSN for two years now  They really do offer a lot here with affordable classes too  As far as professors go  you can always review them before hand on ratemyprofessor com (this has helped me a lot!) Although  I have had a lousy one before  and even with decent reviews  I suppose it just happens sometimes  The only issue I can find here is that all the locations are a little old and run down  from the bathrooms to the chairs and tables in the cafe area  At the end of the day  I go here for the sake of the price  not to sit down and eat on campus in between classes  It doesnt really have that cool  modern  and inspirational college feel like how you see in movies  instead its almost like being at high school again ,?
2198963,I have been extremely pleased with Solar City and their customer service every step of the way  My sales person  Braden Ankeny  answered every question and explained everything very clearly  Everyone I have worked with during this process has been nothing but professional and courteous  Today my solar panels were installed and everything looks great! Thanks for everything!,?
2198994,I have been eyeing this place for awhile and decided to finally give in and try it! Not to mention I saw the deal of the day and that brought me in  Funny enough  I didnt get the special once inside I ordered the make your own Jetsun burger and got the crispy chicken burger  Just a heads up: the chicken burger is more of a two crispy chicken strips burger  That was a little bit of a let down  The topping station is stocked alright the garlic mayo and bbq sauce is yummy  I ordered the Chili cheese fries as my side and It was ok  I wouldnt order what I got again if I do come back The atmosphere has a diner feel to it and the service is what you would expect from a burger joint ,?
2199164,I have been forced to come here many times as I am part of a networking group that meets here  I have been to a LOT of establishments in the valley  In regards to how the food tastes    this among the worst tasting food in Chandler  Awful awful awful food!,?
2199382,I have been getting Sals pizzas and salads to go for many years  They are simply the best in the area and we have an abundance of pizza places  This is an excellent product every time  years on end  The dining in experience is great also  The menu items and service are great  Keep up the good work  We are fortunate to have you in the area ,?
2200280,I have been going here a few months and it is an amazing gym where you can not only get a great cardio workout but you will actually learn how to box  I enjoy the options of going to class or coming in and doing your own thing  The trainers who teach classes are great and all the employees are really nice and get to know you  Weather you are a beginner or someone who is in shape and knows how to box  this gym will cater to you and make you feel like a valued member ,?
2201081,I have been going here for several years  and unfortunately  the place has gone downhill  It has become filthy! The lights they use to dry your acrylic nails are caked with old wax and polish; the little fans to dry your polish spew old nail dust; used  gross tools were brought out to do my last fill; when having a brow wax  I was asked to lie down with my head on a piece of parchment paper that had obviously been laid upon by someone previously! In November  I developed an infection in my big toe after a pedi and I had told the girl she cut me  Sure enough  a trip to urgent care and a round of antibiotics later  I was cured  but it hurt badly and I will never get another pedi there again  Its sad because I like the people and the acrylic nails stay on well and look lovely  but its not worth risking my health!,?
2201239,I have been going here for years and love Dr  Kinsley! Unfortunately  I will never go back because of the rude old Hispanic receptionist  She talked to me like I was stupid then basically accused my daughter and I of lying! I refuse to patronize this business again  solely because of the receptionist  Dr  Knisley needs to retrain her on how to communicate and greet your patients  otherwise Im sure I wont be the only one ending services with her ,?
2201611,I have been going here since I was a kid  best donuts ever! Crumb donut is amazing  but all of their donuts are good  they have donut holes  thai tea and coffee drinks  The same people have been working here for as long as I can remember ,?
2202699,I have been going to Cherry Lash Lounge for almost 3 years and I absolutely will not let anyone else touch my lashes  Sherria and Syretta are the best!!!!!,?
2203050,I have been going to Dr Brodkin for over seven years!  She delivered my first child and is about to deliver my second child   She is a very honest and respectable doctor   She treats her patients as friends more so than patients and we have developed such a wonderful rapport   I travel the extra distance just to go to her and could not imagine going to anyone else   The office is beautiful   The office staff is incredibly nice and friendly   Ana and Wendy the two nurse practitioners are very knowledgable!  highly recommended!!!,?
2203141,I have been going to Dr  Anna for many years and every time I am there I have received the ultimate healthcare and concern  Dr  Anna is diligent  thorough and honest  She is extremely knowledgeable  professional and compassionate  Dr  Anna really goes above and beyond to manage my care and expectations  In talking with other patients and another friend that goes there  they have always expressed the highest ratings and their experiences have been top notch like mine  The office is very clean and the office has a friendly atmosphere  My interactions are always positive and I have always been given the correct information  The office team always follows up with prescriptions or referrals right awayit is great to count on them  I would definitely recommend Dr  Anna especially after all these years of continued great healthcare ,?
2203228,I have been going to Dr  Glassman for 6 years  I think?This office  staff and doctor are very down to earth and friendly   Everyone makes you feel so welcome Appointments are always on time and efficient   The fact that they have a lab in the office is also a huge plus!,?
2203245,I have been going to Dr  Hansen since 2006 & I will continue to see him for all my foot and ankle needs (I even drive all the way from Central Phoenix now to see him)   He is simply amazing!  He listens  he talks WITH you about options instead of talking AT you   Hes compassionate & comforts you if you have a little panic attack or a breakdown like yours truly!  I honestly cannot say enough about him ,?
2203376,I have been going to Dr  Shawn for about sixteen years now  I absolutely love everyone in the office  I have sent everyone from my grandfather down to my youngest family members there and frequently recommend them to clients when massage therapy isnt enough  I wouldnt send anyone I know anywhere else  Gilbertsons is quality chiropractic care from people I truly trust ,?
2203826,I have been going to Goldies for years  Best wings in town   I have pretty much had everything on their menu and its all good! I dont know where they find their waitresses or who hires them but they are all so cute and friendly  Lots of TVs with sports going all the time  So good food  friendly  good looking staff and sports   what more could you want?  Can be a bit long sometimes getting food from the kitchen so a lunch hour isnt enough ,?
2204296,I have been going to Kayla for several years and just love her  She gives me exactly what I am looking for and does a FANTASTIC job ,?
2204995,I have been going to Norterra Animal Hospital ever since I moved up here in the summer of 2014   This place is as good as it gets   My girls (dog & cat) and I  get treated like family the second we walk through the door   With senior animals vet visits can be frequent  No matter what vet they see Dr  Horvath Dr Simonson or Dr Gold they get perfect care   The Drs communicate with each other and are all aware of my girls needs The Vet techs there are excellent   Alexyss and Alyx  take pride in the clinic and making sureall of the animals feel comfortable and cared for during the whole process  even the dreadedtemperature part I highly recommend this place!,?
2207494,I have been going to this car wash weekly for over a year now  Every time  this place is great  The owner Harry really knows what car guys want  clear coat foam and even a doityourself driver  Also great that I can use my credit card instead of cash  Im able to get a perfect shine every time I visit!,?
2208588,I have been going to this restaurant for more than 10 years  never a bad experience  always delicious and inexpensive! Highly recommended,?
2209095,I have been happy with the food but I  no longer am going back  I was with 8 other women and we go to this restaurant at least once a month  My friend asked for a little extra sauce on her meal and was charged an extra amount  After years of going to this restaurant they have decided to charge everyone an extra $1 for using a debit or credit card  I just find this outrageous in a world where almost everyone uses plastic The parking situation is dangerous if you need to park in the back  I must compliment the servers and the chef but the management/owners obviously are not interested in return customers ,?
2209807,I have been here 4 times in the past month and havent had a bad meal yet  All the banchan side dishes are fresh and change with each visit because they only serve fresh items  The basics the kalbi  the naeng myun  the ddeok bokki  are pitch perfect  They feature sushi which we havent tried yet but got a tasting of as an amuse bouche and it was fresh  beautiful  and tasty  My wife has tried the hwedupbap the raw fish on rice with red pepper paste  and declared it excellent  The soondooboo jjigae (silken tofu soup  spicy  with seafood) is the best in town  The only downside is the ongoing construction on Superior  the abandoned looking store front shared with Superior Pho  and the hole in the wall aesthete  But the food  oh the food! Cleveland beautiful  This is the place for Korean food in Cleveland and I hope with continued patronage  they will get the venue they deserve ,?
2210263,I have been here a couple times  and both times I had a different masseuse  Both were very professional and sweet! They genuinely love what they do  and it showed in their professionalism and technique   Shayna did my facial both times  and Im extremely impressed with her services   She pays attention to my skin and listens to my concerns  Shayna truly loves what she does and will do everything she can to give the best facial experience   She adds small but memorable touches such as aroma therapy and a peppermint oil scalp massage (seriously if you for whatever strange reason you dont want a facial at least have her do a peppermint oil scalp massage) The price is worth it people  You will love any service you choose here!!!!!,?
2210498,I have been here a few times and food has always been consistent   Usually indian restaurants are good and then after few months they lose the quality   This has been consistent and has been one of the best indian restaurants in the gta  The dishes are flavourful and not watered down   Everything is made fresh to order and they have some decent lunch specials as well  Highly recommended and will frequent the place myself  We have tried the butter chicken  lamb karahi  naan  paneer peas  naan  chicken tikka and samosas  The seating is comfortable and not too crowded  washrooms could be cleaner ,?
2210526,I have been here a few times and have always liked both the food and service   The food is so good that it is difficult to avoid ordering more than I know I can eat in one sitting; I always have to try different dishes ,?
2211544,I have been here a lot  They are cheap and on my way home  They have great lunch specials  Its not the nicest of places but its more of one of those places you go to get food and take home  In a old taco bell location this place is very small inside  It is family run and the owners are always there working and cooking  I like supporting local family businesses and I will continue to eat here  The Chow fun noodles are my favorite and you cant go wrong with beef with broccoli ,?
2211638,I have been here a small handful of times now  Each time I come here is because I am in the area  I see the good Yelp reviews  and each time I leave disappointed  For a diner  they have ok food but definitely not worth the price  We ordered the Mac and cheese and it was way too salty and swimming in a cheese sauce that was way too watery  Also  this whole fad of putting bacon on Mac and cheese is getting old but good if executed properly  This place does not  I ordered the meatloaf  which came with 1 small slice and your choice of side for $14  Lastly  as previously mention  this place doesnt take credit cards which means they should probably move to a more remote location if they feel like scamming taxes ,?
2211697,I have been here about 4 times and each time was relaxing and loved my nails! My husband has never been to a nail salon and he cant wait to come back for a pedicure!You can BYOB or they serve red or white wine They are nice and efficient Give them a try!,?
2212035,I have been here before and this time I got carry out  I got a pepperoni roll and some Verso chips which are homemade seasoned potato chips with a side of ranch dressing  The pepperoni roll was okay but not amazing  I couldnt taste a lot of pepperoni  The dough was very soft and the mozzarella cheese was good but I wish there wouldve been more pepperoni in it  The Verso chips were okay but definitely dont get them if theyre just for you  they give you a huge order  Half of the chips were not completely fried so they looked a bit sketchy  Id be a bit more understanding about the chips if the place was packed but it wasnt Ill definitely go back but try other stuff  Theyre food is good but I havent had anything yet thats great ,?
2212145,I have been here countless of times but always forget to write a review! I have to say that its delish! We tend to sit at the bar and mingle with the mixologist who are amazingly friendly!The meatballs are amazing (Im vegan the family say they are) The pizzas are amazing! The crust! Is even better in the morning HH is from 47 so come down and try everything you wont be disappointed; grab a glass or bottle of wine and there signature cocktails ,?
2212329,I have been here for both brunch and dinner  Let me tell you  it was amazing! My friends and I ordered a few things on the brunch menu to share (it all looked so good) and it was delicious! The brunch burger  chicken and waffles  French toast  Belgian waffles with berries  and the big Bloody Mary! Try the St  Chelsea on the drink menu and thank me later  When I went for dinner I had the signature Twelve whiskey BBQ burger and a side of Kansas City cheesy corn  The burger was melt in your mouth good and the cheesy corn is addicting Great atmosphere  polite staff  great food  Its my new stop when I go to Southside!,?
2212650,I have been here many times   I got both my tragus pierced here on 2 separate occasions  I got 2 dermal anchors done here and I then had some piercings removed because of rejection  The customer service is top notch and all the piercers actually have experience and know what they are doing  I came in here today to get one of my dermal anchors under my belly button removed because the other one rejected  and I was literally in and out in less than 10 minutes  Jacob did the removal  he was fast and knew what he was doing  They didnt charge me to remove it but I still tipped him  And a lot of piercing places charge you to get them removed  Just an FYI   If you have a healed dermal  it hurts like a b*^%# to get it removed LOL  But honestly this is the only place I will recommend for piercings !,?
2213541,I have been here on numerous occasions with a variety of people and the one thing I must say about this place is inconsistency   You can go there one night and have great food and service  whereas you could go there on a totally different night and experience the complete opposite   The same goes for the food   Some dishes are awesome (shrimp and grits  stuffed chicken) while others I would definitely shy away from (pizza)   If you are a beer lover  they have some good brews which are actually crafted on site   The beer can be better than the food more times than not and I would recommend people to go here for that more than the food   The Southern Flyer is great for pale ale folks like myself   If you give this place a shot  prepare to roll the dice because you dont know who you will get  or what the food will be like when it comes out   The one thing you will be guaranteed to have if you are so inclined is a nice brew made onsite   Cant beat that sometimes   ,?
2213761,I have been here plenty of times through the years   This is a good joint to go when you want something other than your typical Dennys or IHOP   After breakfast  youll find decent deli sandwiches and platters as well as really good desserts   The food and service wont knock your socks off  but its a step above the other options   Unless youre at least 70  youll feel like a youngster here as well   So  if you need handicap parking  get here early ,?
2213865,I have been here quite a few times  mainly for the location   It is located right in the middle of East 4th street and conveniently close to the casino  Quicken Loans Area and Progressive Field   The food here ok  but by no means some of the best mexican food I have had   They have selections that include quesadillas  tacos and some house specialties   They chips and salsa with guacamole is pretty good here  so i always like to get an order of guacamole   I usually get the quesadilla with black beans and its pretty good! Over all if you are downtown and want a good meal for a decent price this is a good place to go   If you plan on going a Friday or Saturday night especially with a large group  I highly suggest you make a reservation ,?
2213886,I have been here regularly  I only order their soups coming with rice  Never tried other dishes because soup is their specialty  and I have this impression that other dishes are not so genuine Korean dishes  My favourites are spicy tofu soup and bolgogi  All the soup comes with rice  They are so hearty and filling in a cold time  Tofu soup has a very soft and creamy tofu inside  The bolgogi is two big sets of pork bone with potato cooked for a long time  There are plastic gloves for you to hold the bone and devour  The kimchi soup is also recommended  They offer complimentary appetizers which you can ask for refill  Also hot tea for free  All the dishes are inexpensive  so student friendly  I used to hangout here regularly with my friends  If you like spicy food  their soups are must try ,?
2214142,I have been here several times and the donuts are good   They have a nice selection  like most places do    Everything appears to be made on site since there is a kitchen in the back They also offer a variety of sandwiches for breakfast and lunch   Starting at $3 99 for a combo ,?
2214409,I have been here several times over the course of a year   The food is really good  great service   One of the best hamburgers I have ever had    The macaroni and cheese is to die for  so leave the diet behind ,?
2215434,I have been here twice and was pleased both times  They of course try to sell you more things than whats needed but they all do this  Im happy overall  Will go back ,?
2215848,I have been here twice now  the food is great & the atmosphere is charming  Remember your bottle of wine and treat yourself to an enjoyable evening @ Cafe Du Jour ,?
2216129,I have been here twice  and while the food is good and the service is excellent  I have to agree with the first reviewer that for the money I could have been more impressed ,?
2218541,I have been loyal to this restaurant for years up until now  I came in and ordered my usual  however this time the (chubby girl at the register) messed it up  She put in Terry chicken instead of garlic  She then comes to my table with the wrong order  and I correct her  Not an apology  no ownership  no care for her mistake  She runs and tells the cook to drop a garlic chx  Both of my friends eat their entire meal and the garlic chx still isnt ready  I walk up to the register and tell her Ill just take it to go  She says to me You guys came in drunk     No name tag girl then said listen haole (white person) get your order straight next time ahh Discrimination  lack of training  and no chame ,?
2218826,I have been meaning to try this place based on the reviews and the fact that I am at Frys or Costco all of the time and it is right around the corner  We stopped in today for a quick snack  The fish tacos are amazing  They hand battered them in front of us and the steak burrito was great too  I love the condiment bar because you can put whatever you want on your food! The prices are also very reasonable for the amount of food you get!,?
2219280,I have been on the hunt for a wax salon and I finally found the ONE! The staff was amazing! They squeezed me in and were very quick to respond via email  Friendly upon arrival and short wait time  My esthetician did an amazing job! She was quick  thorough  made me feel comfortable  and gave me a few helpful tips for at home care which I really appreciated! Plus their body scrub is wonderful!,?
2219288,I have been on the hunt for good sushi places since I moved to Charlotte from AZ / SoCal  This is my all time favorite place  As close to west coast sushi as you can get and some of the rolls are better then what I get in San Diego  The servers are always nice and I sit at the sushi bar to bs with the sushi chefs  If I could give them more stars I would ,?
2219335,I have been on this side of town for 3 years now and just found them  A friend referred them to me and this is definitely my new place  Only my 2nd time here and they remembered my name as soon as I walked in  They fit me in with my busy schedule  Everyone should go here,?
2219394,I have been ordering food from here using Uber Eats for a while now and had the pleasure of eating there in person last night   What a nice  cozy little place!  The owner Lee is an absolute sweetheart and gives the best customer service   The food is was all delicious (which we already knew from ordering there before)   We ordered the spicy basil chicken  pineapple fried rice  papaya salad  and calamari   Nothing disappointed   I would love to see the restaurant so well and stay so please go bring your friends and family and enjoy!!,?
2219510,I have been ordering parts for my 84 Mercedes 300SD from these guys for   8 years  now  maybe?  I would never  NEVER   order parts from anywhere   Literally  these guys are amazing  period   Free shipping on ANY order over $50   You cant beat that!,?
2219516,I have been ordering pizza here for years and theres a reason why  There pizzas are well cooked and the crust is the way I like it  a little crispy and a little chewy  You can also ask them to cook it more or less depending on your preference On a Saturday night this place gets filled really fast  its great for family parties  The only down side is this place is a little bit small and the last time I had my pizza I felt the cheese was a tad too salty  I would have gave it a 5 star rating  Anyway if you go take the Mercedes pizza    Absolutely delicious,?
2219702,I have been planning to have another tattoo done months and months away so when I knew we were coming to vegas for a quick break  I did my research and decided to have it done at this studio First impression of this place that it was hip and really clean  The decors and bright paint created an ambiance appropriate for the kind of service they provide My tattoo was $ 180 excluding tip Everyone knows what they are doing and are very experienced in their chosen artistic field I am very happy with the outcome of my ink  Would recommend to people who are interested in having their first tattoo done or would like to add more tattoos Keep up the good job! WOuld recommend this to all my friends!!!!,?
2220242,I have been running a nonprofit Dog Rescue in Phoenix for several years   I have worked with many local vets as well   Every interaction I have had with Diamondback has been exceptional   Their staff is always eager to help in any way and they never keep any of my dogs in need waiting   Ive also had to treat 2 of my personal dogs  one with Hemolytic Anemia and the other with severe arthritis and my medicines were so much cheaper here Most recently  one of the amazing staff members actually paid out of their own pocket and personally donated a drug we desperately needed to treat a very serious condition for a dog we rescued from the streets and would have died without   I really think people need to understand that dealing with sick pets is stressful in and of itself lets try not to take it out on the service providers and pharmacies who are here to help Diamondback will ALWAYS have my continued  loyal business ,?
2221138,I have been seeing Maria for nearly 20 years  she is very knowledgeable on skin care and has helped me with many skin care issues over the years she makes her own products and sells them right there at the store amazing soaps lip balms and oils  I have been to highpriced spas and other facials   but no one compares to Maria and her knowledge and expertise  She is the very best and I highly recommend her ,?
2221212,I have been seeing Selena for a few months    She is incredibly talented  Its so difficult to find a consistent hair cut   She is flawless ever single time   The very first cut she even explained to me how to work around my cowlicks  how shell blend them with the cut  and how to style it day to day  On top of how incredible Selena is  Id really like to give a huge shout out to their receptionist! (Sorry I dont know your name  I keep meaning to ask!) Ever since my first time in  she recognizes me when I walk in   She even knows that Im always there for Selena    My first hair cut was right before my wedding  and I love that she asks about how married life is    I work with the public and see so many faces in a day    Its soooo hard to get everyone straight   How this woman remembers so much detail is seriously a talent ,?
2221424,I have been shipping items for the past 5 years and I have to say that this is THE worst place to ship your item   I pack ALL of my own items and not ONE time in the past 5 years have I had an employee at a UPS  post office or FedEx store EVER tell me that the item had to be reboxed in order for it to fit on the truck   THEY did and I was forced to purchase a box   Not only that  but EVERY time I walk in this place  I am asked what I am shipping   I have NEVER been asked that till I walked into there   So  since I knew it was the last time I was EVER going to drop a box there (i only did it because of the convenience)  I was asked what I was shipping and I told them used vibrators   PLEASE avoid this place like the plague ,?
2221720,I have been shopping here since the day they opened  I live the store and the people that work there  The only reason I dont give it 5 stars is because the prices are a little high ,?
2222981,I have been taking my puppy  Morkie breed here since reading the reviews  They are very nice  prompt and professional  The prices are better than Petsmart for $65 00 you can get your puppy a complete day at the spa!! Making grooming fun for them and leaving them happy  A cut  bath  facial  toes  anal glands  style  fragrance and bow/bandana all in a day  Small local business very well maintained and ran  Love some puppy luv dog grooming ,?
2224098,I have been to Aces twice for their winter beer fest  Its a fantastic place for craft beers  Recently they have added more (and more comfortable) seating as well as new flat screen tvs Again I can only give Aces 4 stars because they need to open another location by me  I cant be forking over 55$ for a cab ride every time that I want to drink some beers  The beers are so good! Food is decent and fairly priced  Service can sometimes be spotty  but the last two times I have been there its been very good ,?
2224295,I have been to Bella Luna numerous times in the past three years and it never fails to satisfy! They just went through a remodel and the place looks great! Much more modern and welcoming  I have had many things on the menu  from pastas to sandwhiches to pizzas and without a doubt my favorite item is the fried zucchini appetizer  It is without a doubt the best fried zucchini I have ever had  The breading is light and crispy and the zucchini still tastes fresh and not the least bit mushy  I have ordered a small zucchini appetizer and a bowl of wedding soup and made it a meal and it was absolutely perfect  Great restaurant for a date or for taking the whole family ,?
2224754,I have been to Delightful Nails a handful of times now and seen 2 different nail techs and have been VERY happy with their work!  I highly suggest them to anyone  AND they just moved into a larger suite that holds a lot of pedi and nail stations!!! My daughter and I will be back in a couple weeks for another fill and pedi  I have decided they are my go to now!!!!,?
2224937,I have been to Farmer boys over 25 times  I love it  But this one experience was horrible  Originally from SoCal so we have many in my area where i grew up  The burger was horrible  When the food was brought to table i asked for more ranch for my zucchini and that was forgotten  I mean the pictures show the story  2 completely different patties  They gave me a $5 off coupon which was a nice gesture but feel like it could have been more  I will be back but this experience wasnt the best ,?
2225044,I have been to Gal Sushi many time  and I definitely place too much hope in this restaurant  See  Ive been to the restaurant when it first opened  and watched the restaurant grow as it moved from highway 7 and Warden to where it is now  Yesterday is the last time I will ever be going  Please hear me out  there is BETTER SUSHI IN MARKHAM/RICHMOND HILL *quality is bad  the fish  and especially the sashimi tuna was hard to chew  and got stuck in your teeth  (im no food critic  but i know when that is bad)*my mum and i both felt sick after eating the raw fish  and it was not a good feeling in my stomach*when you ask for potato instead of rice in your bento box  they give you 4 tiny pieces of potatoThe good is that the food comes quickly and the waiters are relatively nice  But overall  the quality has really decreased from where it once was  and I will be refusing to go to Gal Sushi ever again  Its had too many second chances from me ,?
2225859,I have been to Miracle Mile before  just not this one  Probably not a fair review because I only got a grill cheese sandwich  It comes with a side  I got chips and a drink  You get to choose your bread and I chose the marble rye  The makings for a great sandwich  So what kind of cheese do they use? Not real cheese  You know the kind that is wrapped in plastic and will keep in the refrigerator for two years and still be eatable  On the better side my mother in law and father in law got a ruben and a turkey  Those sandwiches really looked good and they said so  The service was as good as you could ever expect at a cafeteria type of eatery  Everyone was friendly and the people that came by the tables cleaning and helping guests were fantastic  I was very impressed with they way they took care of everyone  Unless you are fond of imitation cheese pass on the grill cheese sandwich  Everything else looked good ,?
2226212,I have been to Pittsburgh twice and some how I have been to this place both times  Its probably because I am with people who used to live in the area but I am not opposed to going back here The food is pretty good and it comes out fast and tastes pretty good I would recommend it if you are looking for something good  fast and affordable ,?
2229430,I have been to see Dr Rosenberg twice now  and Im looking forward to my next visit   The office staff is very friendly and efficient   The scheduling is easy and quick   And most of all  Dr Rosenberg   what can I say?  He is a gem of a doctor   He is one of those doctors who seems to appreciate his patients  and not just their pocketbooks or insurance payments   I just get the impression that he enjoys people As far as actually taking care of business  hes quick and painless and does a fantastic job of numbing you up and slicing off whatever ails ya   He explains your options and is mindful about what its going to cost you out of pocket  so he takes that into consideration when recommending treatment I would never go to another dermatologist   I just wish he was a general practitioner so I could go to him for everything!,?
2229715,I have been to several places in LV area to get my wifes frame fixed  Few places have parts and some recommended a place initialed FF  I went there in Henderson and was spoken down to and told the repair would be twice what I had estimated  Enough of FF  I found out about J Crimi Eyewear Boutique and it was walking into heaven  A warm greeting  an adult conversation  and a few minutes later my problem was solved  I cant say enough about the experience other than  if you need frames repaired make this your first stop!,?
2230409,I have been to the Wynn quite a few times but after what went down tonight I will not be returning  Their custumer service and treatment towards guests specifically at the casino was appaling! When I went to complain all I asked for was an apology and nothing else  The superviser refused to apologize and therefore sent me security to throw me out  They didnt allow me to wait for my friends  didnt let me get my belongings from my room and when I asked them where to get an uber was treated like a hostile  This happened to me and I honestly did absolutely nothing wrong and wasnt even tipsy  Imagine what they do to others  If you are looking for brutality and no concept of respect towards paying plus tippong guests then go to the Wynn!,?
2231248,I have been to this establishment many times over the last 9 years for a pedi   The majority of the time the experience has been good   The last two times has been absolutely horrible   I made the mistake of going back and taking my friends from out of town there   They shaved the top of her heels and made them bleed and just kept on scraping   I sat down last out of us all and was finished first   They put no effort into my feet whatsoever   Proceed with caution if you decide to visit this place ,?
2232242,I have been to this place a couple of times now   I have witnessed the staff here being consistently nice   We have ordered pitas  a pita plate and the chicken and rice kids meal   The pitas are great   They are gyros   The plate was great too   I got french fries with it and a Greek Salad   I could not believe the size of the Greek Salad   It was huge and delicious ,?
2232587,I have been to this place once before  but the second time I came in was to get my bike checked out because my brand new bike tires would not fill up with air  The floor salesman asked me a couple of questions about my bike and was a bit snippy with me  Making me feel the reason my bike tires were flat was due to consumer error as not filling the tires up with air  When I brought the bike in  the repair guy behind the counter was very nice and was able to take out the tubes and realized they were terrible quality and had holes in them  The floor salesman then asked if I had ever filled up the tires since buying the bike in December    again making me feel like this was an issue caused by not putting air in the tires  Overall  my experience with the other gentleman was great  but the salesman needs to learn a little bit about customer service and how to treat his customers with respect  Otherwise I would have given my experience 5 stars ,?
2233539,I have been to this theater twice now  hoping to have a better experience the second time  However on both occasions there were only two kids working the concessions and it took about 20 minutes to get a drink  at least  The biggest problem here is the overflowing trash EVERYWHERE you look  It is unsightly and ridiculous that they do not employ more people  or are too cheap to do so  With the cost of movies surely they can afford it  The 2 stars are earned for having recliner seats and accepting tickets via the app  that is the only plus here,?
2233651,I have been to two other Red Lobster restaurants this one is by far the worst Ive ever been to Im giving it two stars because the waiters were amazing  It took them an hour to bring us salads and everything was salty I e  biscuits  popcorn shrimp and everything else except my fries  Attached is a photo of my breaded tilapia which tasted like a fish that they dumped bread crumbs on It didnt really look cooked I saw some pink on my fish the waiter was very nice took it back to management who then told him to pass on the message that  that is how its suppose to be  The breadcrumbs were completely white !!!! The waiter said they will cook it again the second time it came back it was black    I didnt complain just ate my fish because I was starving  Heads up I think I now have food poisoning ,?
2234152,I have been trying to get a proper appointment set up but the receptionists seem to rude or above everyone when answering basic questions Thank you but no thank you  another doc will do,?
2234213,I have been trying to get to this place my last three trips to Vegas  I finally made it but I only had time to try the lobsicle  It was delicious  cooked perfect and served with warm butter ,?
2234632,I have been using Business of Baskets for 11 years and have used Deb exclusively with my gift giving needs   The reason I keep coming back is that she takes the time to listen about my clients and tailors a gift around that person and their interests   There is no better feeling when I am told that the gift I gave was so thoughtfully given   Deb is an A in customer service and always get the order in on time   Wouldnt use anyone else!,?
2235665,I have been using this location for the past year without any issue  My clothes are always ready the next day without any articles missing or anything burnt Service can be a bit slow after work due to the size and location  but my wait to check in is never over 10 minutes  I will continue to use them moving forward ,?
2235979,I have been very satisfied with Mitchell Chiropractic  The Dr and the staff are top notch and they give excellent customer service  I am very happy with my results  and I would like to give them a high recommendation  You will not be sorry choosing Mitchell Chiropractic ,?
2236519,I have been waiting for years for a place like this in mtl to open  Cheap and fresh tacos  totally authentic (which is impossible to find in this town) and amazing salsas  They do make great veggie tacos if you ask  This is def now my fav spot in the neighbourhood!,?
2236922,I have been wanting to get a reading done for a while now  Its been years since Ive received one  Im truly happy that I decided to give Laura a visit  Her place is warm  wonderful aroma  and enlightening  I personally did the $65 option (about 3540min)and received a tarot card reading  and a discussion about my future  You are able to ask two questions at the end as well My reading was ridiculously on point  I was a bit apprehensive and of course readings are based on what youre willing to open up about  But overall I had a wonderful time visiting Laura  She is kind and seems genuine with helping others,?
2237014,I have been wanting to go to Mesa Grill for years  I talked my husband and friends into going to the Vegas location last week  What a disappointment  Appetizers were the best part (fundido and tamale)  Main courses were not good  Fatty and chewy steak for steak tacos  Cold sweet potato hash under my eggs Benedict  Cold fries with the burger when spoke with the waiter about our issues and could we speak to the manager he said thats not how things worked and he would speak to the chef directly  It also would have been nice if the waiter told us we had to pay for water  Sorry to say I will not recommend this restaurant nor will I rush to any other of Bobby Flays restaurants ,?
2237128,I have been wanting to try Bar 145 for awhile now and Im glad I did! The setting including the nice outdoor patio does not make me think of Kent which is nice (doesnt remind me of a college town) Staff was very helpful and friendly when trying to choose from the menu and gave great recommendations based on what they liked  The menu was limited so I ended up getting a black bean panini with truffle fries and a awesome simple sangria  The food looked and tasted great! Great experience and I look forward to tasting the lobster mac and cheese ,?
2237817,I have been with Allstate since I started driving in 1986  And although I have always been very happy with my coverage it wasnt until I moved from N J  to Nevada that  I actually experienced a face to face with my Insurance Company  Kevin Walker was my contact prior to my relocation   He honestly made my transition seamless & ensured no interruption of coverage  Any time I call he is always there to answer any questions or concerns  I am proud to be a lifetime member of Allstate & highly recommend Kevin as one of their best assets!!,?
2238721,I have both TigerCats and Argonauts season tickets and Im a huge fan of this stadium for CFL the fans and staff are super friendly  I would recommend seeing a CFL game here over Hamilton any day  This is one of my favorite places to see a CFL game ,?
2238929,I have bought many trees from Shamus Olearys and everyone is always very courteous and helpful   There are so many knowledgeable people there!  I would definitely recommend!,?
2239662,I have come here a few times now and I really like this place  The owner has always been here working the line and the staff is really nice  I have only done take out from here so far  but even as a take out customer  the staff still treats me like I am dining at there  They have me take a seat and ask me if I would like a glass of water while I wait  The first couple of times Ive been here I got the same thing  Original curry with pork katsu and kurobota sausage with corn  Recently I tried the 5 piece kushi and it was delicious  I also asked if I could get a couple of extra skewers of quail eggs and I could and I did! I would like to try some of the other choices so I will definitely be back ,?
2239679,I have come here a few times  It is one of the most fun places I have ever been! Thanks great skate!,?
2240686,I have decided to give Zellers an additional star for two reasons   The first  is that I did the first review early on in my Yelping career and now that I have a more refined review palate I feel I was overly harsh   The second reason is that they often have discount candy near the registers in those old school cardboard boxes that you used to get at the movie theatre ,?
2240849,I have dined at Clydes at least 6 times since they opened  Each time  I enjoyed the decor  food and service  Last night was a DISASTER! The first two items I ordered were out although the server did not know that until she put the order in  When I finally settled on my third choice  the food took almost 45 minutes to arrive  It was OK  but not even close to their usual quality  I finally asked if the restaurant had experienced a change in management  and was told they had  Too bad   it was a nice neighborhood place with consistently good food  The server was pleasant  but she was put in an uncomfortable position given the overall circumstances ,?
2241791,I have driven by this restaurant for years so today I stopped in  I LOVE all the Chicago memorabilia which was enhanced by the DELICIOUS sliders I tried  They were smothered in fried onions  pickles  a perfect blend of ketchup and brown mustard on a wonderfully fresh bun  I will definitely be back to try the Vienna hot dogs and shakes ,?
2242019,I have eaten Wolfgang puck at the MGM HOTEL and its way better then this one  I thought it would be the same but I guess I was wrong  pizza wasnt as good the salads were ok  no I will not go back here sorry!,?
2242034,I have eaten a lot of Sushi but this place is by far THE best!!!The presentation Great service and super friendly staff!!!The fresh Wasabi is the bomb!!!,?
2242323,I have eaten at Panera Bread many many times  We came in tonight for a fast dinner before going to a movie  We are not looking for gourmet food or fine dining  Just a fast inexpensive meal  The staff behind the counter was friendly and very helpful  The server who brought the food to the table was also incredibly friendly ( and very forgiving considering I knocked over my glass of water and she had to clean it up  She did it with a smile and a good sense of humor)  I ordered the Southwest chicken salad  My wife got a BLT sandwich  My salad was actually quite good  Lots of chicken  lots of avocado  lots of corn and lots of chips  Overall a pretty good southwest chicken salad  My wife was disappointed with her sandwich  It wasnt bad it was just nothing special and you expect more from a sandwich at Panera Bread then just nothing special  Overall  it accomplished what we wanted  An informal inexpensive meal before a movie ,?
2242593,I have eaten at many Salsitas which are usually good  but this one sucks  Six bucks for a pollo asada borito that was pretty much beans and rice  What chicken there was had a funky smell ,?
2244498,I have eaten here twice now  once with friends who took me  and the other time with my husband   Both times it was great!  The service was really good  and the food is great   The atmosphere is casual to fine dining  an in between   The history of the building and art inside is really cool!  You cant go wrong!,?
2244942,I have eating at the of pfchangs for years especially the of pfchangs Northlake at Charlotte North Carolina   At 3 different occasions when I dine in at the restaurant with an order of ther sesame chicken and white rice  my food was served to me with the stickers on the bell peppers still on each bell pepper in my food which threw me off so I could not eat my food and that my whole dinner was wasted and my money as well   I took pictures and contacted guest services the next day which I was informed that the district manager will be contacting me within 48 hours and its been 3 weeks now nobody has contacted me yet neither did they do anything towards my negative experience   Pfchangs restaurant is truly really getting worst with their food and guest services  I wish I can post those pictures here so yall can see how nasty their food looked  ,?
2246003,I have found Smile Concepts to be a fair price point place   it is a family run business and that makes it much more friendly ,?
2246013,I have found a few items over the past year here  So I decided to try consigning  What a rip off! $23 for 2 Michael Kors dresses  1 Talbots dress  a Nordstrom skirt and blouse and Via Spiga shoes  All either never worn or worn once  Wont be spending my money here anymore!,?
2246135,I have found my home  Everything is perfectly seasoned and fried  I had the chicken  curly fries  chili  slaw  pepperoni roll thingies  and got their amazing spicy garlic dipping sauce  While eating I watched a screen above the bar tempt me with pictures of their deep fried thick bacon strips  I am coming back to try that! The staff is friendly  attentive  conversationalunlike most of the service industry in this town  Kudos for grease and good cheer!,?
2246335,I have found the Holy Grail of aestheticians! She is amazing  I decided to go and see Jeanette after my hairstylist (Krissy Moore who is also at the Valencia Studios who is phenomenal but thats a whole nother review!) had told me about her  as well as researching up a good aesthetician on here  I didnt have to wait at all  she was a perfectionist and did an amazing job with my eyebrows  Her prices are so good  which is great to find around times such as now  I almost fell asleep while getting my eyebrows waxed and plucked away  imagine that  The bed you lay on is so comfy  I was in heaven as she worked on my brows  She made me feel really welcome  and comforted and she was such a sweet person  I have definitely found my aesthetician! I am going to recommend her to every person I know ,?
2247145,I have gone back twice since my last post and both experiences were much better  The signs were fixed and there wasnt a bee in sight  We had a great time and will go back for sure! So glad they have worked at fixing the previous issues mentioned!,?
2247267,I have gone here countless times and had great service and great food  except for today  Went in  ordered and while I was waiting several families with children came roughly 20 min after I ordered  Waited roughly an hour from ordering and the families started receiving their food  inquired about my order from waiter and he ran in back and we watched him put our sides in the microwave  Then bring them out  The cheese curds and tater tots were soggy  He said he needed to run back and get the wings  we waited 10 more minutes and by this time we had to leave and the waiter finally brought out the food  I stopped him and got up to leave and paid for my drinks  When I got out to my car the owner drunkenly stormed out and started cussing me out saying he was throwing the food away and told us that he got slammed so we should understand  Then he flipped us the bird and shouted at us to fuck off ,?
2247439,I have gone here twice in the last year  The first time I got a meat ball sub with onions on Italian Bread  4 hours later I came down with food poisoning  A day ago I went again just to give it a 2nd chance  I mean what are the odds right? Apparently they werent in my favor  I ordered the same thing  I should have known when I took the first bite something was wrong because the meatballs were basically cold  I heated it up in the microwave and choked it down  It was mostly cheese not much sauce  I ended up throwing out the other half  I woke up at 2am with food poisoning AGAIN! I tried calling them but no one answered  Never again  I dont even think I can look at a Subway sign without feeling like I want to throw up  Im sure they arent all like this but 2 times in one year at this same location  thats ridiculous  Im done ,?
2247787,I have gone to Magic Tailor a couple times before with moderate satisfaction but the third and last time I went  I had a terrible experience The environment was very uncomfortable as the tailor was cursing and said out loud what a bad mood he was in after telling me Id gained weight in my thighs cause he remembered my body  Granted  we all have our days but a certain amount of professionalism is necessary at the work place  He proceeded to blatantly overcharge me for my simple alterations of tucking in some tiny sleeves seemingly offended after I asked him to stop swearing  Needless to say  NEVER AGAIN!,?
2248422,I have gone to this restaurant many times before and I usually order vermicelli or pad Thai and both dishes are phenomenal ,?
2248572,I have got to do this place some justice  We were pretty lucky when we went  got the track to race between ourselves  It was tons of fun and our times were approx 22 and 23 secs per lap  The karts are solid as they run at a decent speeds (I would say realistically 5060 kph)  I do not think it goes up to 80 kph as they state since I floored it without ever pressing the brake for a large stretch of the track  The only downside is the the indoor track is quite small and simple  It was a great experience nonetheless and I would definitely come back again!,?
2248600,I have got to say their food started out as pretty good   The last meal I had was superb!  Go Chutneys!,?
2248769,I have gotten my hair done by Teresa for the last 6 months  My hair has never felt so healthy and has never looked so beautiful  A very close friend of mine is also Teresas client  however  shes been having her hair done by her for years  I received Teresas information from my friend who swears by how amazing Teresa is and I am so thankful for the referral! I recommend her to everyone  All of her assistants have been amazing as well!!,?
2249416,I have had LVWT install window tint in 2 of my homes over the past 10 years and am extremely happy on all levels   The service provided was superior  I even got an education on the way window film works and the best tint for my windows   Frank is an excellent representative of the company and expert in the field   We are very happy with the protection the windwo tint provides   I would recommend Frank and LVWT to anyone who wants to protect their home and save energy! Thank you Frank!,?
2249456,I have had Mark Sherman as my CPA since 2000 and am very satisfied with his professional service  Based on my experience  I found Mark knowledgeable and honest  He has been prompt in answering financial/accounting questions that I posed to him occasionally   He was also very responsive and quick in handling the IRS letters that were sent to me or my business  I definitely recommend him ,?
2249499,I have had Pat come and groom my cats twice now  She does a great job and the price is reasonable  It is so nice to have the cats groomed at home instead of listening to them cry in the crate in the car ,?
2250036,I have had a lot of issues with the service here  One nail tech named Mae is fantastic  but Ive never had a good experience with the ladies at the reception desk or with any of the other nail techs  The end product is average  but considering the above issues I will take my business elsewhere ,?
2250742,I have had cox for about 6 years and always paid my bill  yet every month I have more fees and owe more money  every time I think my account is back to 0 they inform me about another charge  but lets get to the phone service  110 people that answer the phone are helpful and precise  It took 4 phone calls 3045 min each to have them change my address for my new place  This MONOPOLY is unjust ,?
2251039,I have had great authentic Thai and good Americanized Thai   This was neither  I ordered a beef dish that I always use to test a thai restaurant   The meat was overcooked and that sauce was bland   There wasnt and of the great flavors of thai food   There was also very little meat and so much green beans(which shouldnt be in this dish)   I hope Charlotte has better Thai food somewhere   I will not be returning  though I will say service was very good ,?
2251469,I have had many spray tans in my life but this was by far the best  The color is amazing and very natural looking  It also stays on great and when it starts to wear off does so in a way that still looks natural and not like your turning into a cheetah  I am very impressed and will be back for sure ,?
2251863,I have had my lashes a lot but Lets Lash is BY FAR the best service I have ever had  They looked absolutely amazing and natural   You are definitely making a mistake if you go anywhere else! Not only are the girls there talented the whole environment and atmosphere is just a fun and relaxing experience as a whole  Very high quality service!!,?
2252220,I have had nothing but pleasant experiences with this company  Working with Noah and Tom has been so easy and makes me feel like I am making proper decisions for my future  They are so knowledgeable in their field and I didnt feel pressured into doing anything  They truly care about what is right for me while taking the time to explain everything so that I can understand  They are so on top of the paperwork and making sure everything is signed and working  They understand that I live on a budget and found what I can afford to do while helping me plan for retirement and have the peace of mind for if something were to happen to me  These two are the best in the business and come highly recommended from me  If you want to invest in your future and have someone help you make decision without being in a high pressure sales environment this is your place ,?
2252766,I have had similar issues to other people here   I needed the cleaning to be completed before moving out at the end of the month  I have been rescheduled on three times now  always at the last minute (ex  one hour before the scheduled time for cleaning)  I am incredibly frustrated  and urge anyone to save their $19 dollars  its not about the money so much as having an expectation that will not be met I am currently on my fourth reschedule and we will see if it comes through    As soon as I posted this I received a call cancelling my fourth rebooking  I am now on my fifth reschedule  Seriously  avoid this service at all costs ,?
2253636,I have had the wonderful opportunity to work directly with Katrina   she is a true professional who is passionate about her clients and their needs   Katrina worked alongside my team at many educational events and business planning meetings   Her support was key to our success!  We were so lucky to have her on our team and I look forward to working with her and her new team at Myriad Real Estate Group ,?
2253787,I have had these guys swing by and drop off some burros on a couple of occasions and I was more than impressed!Hot fresh tortilla wrapped goodness  Most recently I had them bring a carne asada burro and a bacon  egg  tater burro for the next day  They have a $15 minimum order for delivery (which I totally understand and think is fair) so ordering a couple things is needed   which is great cuz everything is delicious   Somehow when I started grubbing it was still steaming hot and fresh  BOMB flavors  salsa was goodnspicy and I didnt have to leave the house?!?! yes please and thank you!,?
2253815,I have had this in Hawaii and it was awesome! Here it was weak at best  The service lacked any personal touch  One and done  too bad I was really excited to take my wife  BUMMER!!!,?
2254505,I have heard about Flancers for years    and yet I had never been there until yesterday for lunch Had the Philly Cheesesteak because our waitress said that it was the most popular item  and I can see why It was big and it was great Service was friendly  it didnt take long to get our food once we ordered it and the Cheesesteak was fantastic Yep  I will be back!,?
2254568,I have heard about this place and finally decided to go there for lunch  I sat in the bar area and it was pretty much empty  I order and got my meal  It was good sandwich with fires  Service wasnt fast but it was OK  I wonder if it was because I wasnt drinking  The one big problem is there parking lot  It is very hard to exit it ,?
2255069,I have heard so much about bacchanal buffet at Caesars so went there to check it out during my recent stay in Vegas  I have to say I was highly disappointed    The food was very average and the service was far below average   It was on a weekday and the place was not busy at all but our waiter hardly came by to take our plates  out table was a full of plates  We literally had ask another waiter to pick up our finished plates    Also added the mimosa option for my meal and got one drink the whole night because like I said our waiter was hardly visible   I am giving one star for the beautiful decor and that is it  P S  you will be disappointed with the crab legs    They were sliced up in half and steamed which completely destroyed the taste    i am not sure why they do this   its a crime ,?
2255291,I have hired Brennan & Co  twice to clean my 6000 sqft  home and was charged close to $1000 for this service each time   The first time  they did an amazing job; however  I was in the home the entire time they cleaned it   The second time I was not able to be in the home during the cleaning appointment   I was appalled at the state that they left my house   The cupboards were not wiped out  the floors had dog fur and debris left all over them  my black kitchen sink had a white film that covered the entire area  and several side shelves in my refrigerator were cracked and broken   I will NEVER use this company again and was very disappointed in the service that they provided ,?
2255390,I have hosted multiple corporate events both for my department and for our external partners and have been extremely happy with the outcome  Booking and planning is always easy and quick  which makes my life so much easier  It feels nice to go into these events not stressed about the planning phase  My last event had only a few weeks notice  and luckily they were available and had the seating chart and food built out immediately for me Kelley is very quick to respond about any questions and can execute any specific requests  It is great to have meetings and events here as it is a quick transition into a happy hour with amazing ambiance ,?
2256031,I have known Robert for three years   This is my go to shop for contacts and glasses   Robert treats me like family and clearly has a strong concern for his customers   I highly recommend Lakeshore Optical!,?
2256050,I have known Stephanie for the past 12 years and have benefited greatly from her many gifts  Stephanie helped me to begin my own personal healing journey by starting with my akashic records  I have often said that one cannot build a house without starting with the foundation first  and this philosophy is true on a personal level  Stephanie has continued to help me in various other ways and I will be forever grateful  I strongly recommend Stephanie for many reasons  but primarily because she genuinely cares about others and the healing of the world ,?
2257230,I have lived here since 2002 and love the staff and the programs offered   The dues are much lower than most HOA fees   The community swim and tennis centers director Susan Hyden is very friendly   The programs and events throughout the year are geared for all age and very diverse interests   The pool is clean and the children enrichment programs are great   I also like the small park with picnic areas   There is also a small 9/11 memorial ,?
2257927,I have lived in scottsdale for 5 months now and have yet to find a sushi place I loved   Until I found nori & its right down the road from me! The portions are huge and everything taste fresh & great! The waitress was knowledgable on everything & her recommendations were spot on  Only reason I gave it a four star because the price was a bit much  but not horrible  We will definitely be back!,?
2258769,I have loved this restaurant in the past   Tonights Asian Tuna Dinner salad was very disappointing!  The most boring dinner priced salad ever!  Field greens  onion pieces  wonton strips and tuna that had steak seasoning   There were only 4 soft chunks of tuna which is less than the server stated   The dressing offered was cilantro lime   Ive never had ahi tuna without sesame seeds and will never eat it here again ,?
2259169,I have mixed emotions about this store    I have brought my broken phone to them twice  and both times I was required to pay a $35 fee for a replacement   While this is much cheaper than buying a new phone  I shouldnt have to pay anything as the phone model itself is broken (Google treo access sod)   Anyway  they have technicians in house and the wait is pretty short  not to mention you have an outdoor mall to shop at while you wait ,?
2261015,I have never been more impressed with the selection of art and customer service then at Gallery Andrea! The floral paintings and wearable art took my breath away  We were looking for the perfect piece of art as the focal point for my parents living room and were overjoyed with our purchase  We also left with a dress and scarf to wear to an upcoming event! Bonus! Not to mention  how caring and sweet the owners of the gallery are to their customers  You can tell they love what they do and value their business  Please stop by and shop local  #VeryHappyCustomer,?
2261324,I have never been there when they have given me the correct order  Also  they are the most unprofessional crew of people  Management needs to do a much better job for training ,?
2261521,I have never been to a Wandas waffle but Ive heard so much about it and was really excited to see one so close to home Because of closed shops I went to prior to Wandas for desserts  it gave me the opportunity to finally check this place out I can strongly say that I will very likely not come back again  The waffle I ordered  the ice cream special  tasted like rubbered sand if that even makes sense  It was just not something that captured my palette which was disappointing as this place was famous for waffles  The mochaccino I had on the other hand was excellent! From the get go  it was extremely complicated to order where the clerk had to punch in my order more than twice  They had all sorts of promotion going on that my friend and I had to mathematically figure out together to see which was most cost effective  Overall  this experience hasnt left a lasting impression but hoping to try out the one downtown before I pass judgement!,?
2261689,I have never been to a store where the customer service is so bad  I bought a arch floor lamp 3 weeks ago where the sales associate told me they had it in stock  but they didnt have the coffee table in  got my coffee table a few days later   but no lamp   this store needs to get there act together  I have called multiple times trying to get through to find out if they finally got in my lamp   seems like they dont like to have hire enough staff to answer phones over there  So disappointed in this store  I knew I should of saved my money and shopped at casa life for my living room ,?
2262723,I have never gone in to this store but always gone through the drive through and i must day they are the quickest drive through i have been to  They can have cars wrapped around their store and still get customers right through  Traffic on the other may cause a little back up  but hey what do you expect its China town  The partners are always friendly whenever i pass through  Awesome location to visit,?
2263046,I have never had a bad experience  And I have never had better French onion soup  So awesome,?
2263733,I have never had my eyebrows threaded before  but after reading all these good reviews  I thought I would try this place  I walked in 45 minutes before closing hoping to get in and I did  I forgot to get her name  but she is thin and very sweet  She did an amazing job with my brows and it was so clean  I have yet to see my brows this clean before  I asked her about how to help my brows grow because my brows have been not growing right in the inner corner  I will definitely be back again ,?
2265811,I have no complains about Centrair Electric  They have explained everything to me and I fully understood it all  if you do not understand make sure to ask all the questions you need to know  Other Solar Company offer you to rent their system! Why rent??? You are going to pay for something that much  why not own it?? You might as well own it and it will make the equity on your house go up In the long run you will be saving money  my saving is 91% doesnt that sound great? I have been walked through the whole process of my loan  the interest rate and how much I will be paying at the end   They have notified us when we will get the solar panels would get installed and they give us the estimated time when Nevada Power will do inspections   Do your research  but I do recommend going with Centrair Electric!,?
2265901,I have no complaints for a change  Brio had a lively atmosphere  and the host brought me to my table  She was sweet and talkative  very nice indeed  My server came and discussed the specials then brought me my ice tea  The bread was warm and delicious and then I ordered my meal    For starters I had minestrone soup  it was rich and savory  I could taste hints of bacon  ground beef Garbanzo beans  and so much more   Delicious  Then my ceasers salad  the croutons were the best  For my main course  I had blackened Tilapia with potatoes  and it was PERFECT  The server was spot on with my ice tea refills and I have no complaints  It was a very good dining experience and the food did not disappoint me ,?
2266930,I have no other words  I could come up with something clever and intelligent  but this place is simply the sh*t  I refuse to listen to the people who say all Montreal smoked meat is the same  or that Rubens is better  Im open to change  if its for the better  In this case  once you go Schwartz  you never go back I crave this place  When I fill this craving it satisfies the depths of my soul  not just my stomach  The perfect meal here is a medium sandwich  a side of fries  coleslaw  a pickle and a cherry coke  I hope you wrote that down  They opened a takeout store next door to help manage some of the traffic  The waiters at the dinein restaurant are hilarious  they love to flirt  and provide a few laughs  I brought some back with me  Its whats for lunch   scratch that  Im going to eat it now ,?
2267210,I have not been coming here long  but have had a great experience so far  The office people are wonderful  Very helpful and attentive  The rooms are clean and bright  and the equipment is up to date  My hygienist is great too  Knowledgeable and helpful  Dr  Chung  and Aliante Dental was recommended to me by a friend and I am glad I switched ,?
2267645,I have not been to too many Mexican rstaurants in Vegas but this has to be one of the best  I went here for dinner trusting the reviews of Fellow yelpers and was not dissapointed  The food was amazing and the margarita was awesome  Loved the habanero salsa ,?
2267681,I have not done a real shop in here yet  but from what I experienced on my very first visit I liked   I came for flowers and WOW! They were gorgeous and so affordable   Can I say gorgeous again?  They were wrapped in fake looking newspaper that was even cuter   I will return for flowers without a doubt Then I picked up the soy crisps  I heard good things about these soy crisps (f&e brand) they were really good   I will buy more of them as well I plan to go on a real shop sometime soon and use my $5 off coupon they mailed to my house   Who knows     I could add a star  take away a star  or stay the same   Well seeeeeeeeeeeee ,?
2268802,I have nothing but great things to say about Dr Gilson and his staff  I took my dog  Luna to an emergency vet after finding her with a fractured leg  The emergency vet did an xray and to make a long story short recommended doing a $5000 surgery or amputating the leg I took her in to Dr Gilson for a second opinion and truly felt that he did the research prior to determine a solution  explained to me my options and stayed neutral when presenting me my options  His quote was also almost half than the original place I took her  Very happy with the way the whole staff treated us! Thank you!,?
2269491,I have now been to M Nails twice in the last month  Both times the service was fantastic  Didnt have to wait for them a minute or two  The ladies are fantastic  Both my shellac manicures were beautiful  They really take the time to make sure your nails have set and that the colour is great  This is my new fav salon in my neighbourhood!!,?
2269499,I have now been to Pai three times because the first time I went just wasnt enough  Went night one and ordered a cool mule and loved it so much I ordered the ingredients so I can make my own at home in Ottawa  The pad gra prow is SO good  definitely recommend getting the beef and their green curry is probably the most authentic I have had since being in Thailand  The food is fantastic  the service is great and the atmosphere is one of the best  The place is busy and just keeps going further as you walk around corners  I have never had to wait very long for a table though and they have a cute little stand up bar area so you can order drinks while you wait  I highly recommend checking it out!,?
2271059,I have only come here for threading  so cant comment on anything else  They do an excellent job threading It seems like poor service was mentioned quite a bit here  The girls who work here are not Canadian born  so their mannerisms are very different from North Americans  It is certainly not a pampering spa  but I feel like this place is more authentic and less superficial then the Caucasian spas that charges $30 for threading ,?
2273080,I have passed this place for years! Stationed over in the north side for training and I wish Ive been going everyday  Or not  bc seriously  this apple cheddar bacon sandwich is kind of ruining me for all other sandwiches  It is delicious  everything on the menu looked good  THERE WAS A HO HO CAKE and the girl at the register was genuinely nice and like  excited to help me with bread choices  Definitely a place to visit for lunch if youre over this way and I will keep it in mind for any catering ,?
2273084,I have passed this place hundreds of times and never went  I was in a bridal party & this was the rehearsal dinner choice  She had a fixed menu with a ton of variety  I opted for a buffalo chicken wrap  really good for what it was  Drinks were poured strong and the view was a nice change for the area  I would definitely come back for a relaxed dinner with the fam or Sunday funday ,?
2273834,I have purchased many suits over the years and have had many tailors as well  Im so happy that I found this place! Cynthia did an amazing job altering my suits! Ill definitely be returning to her for any other future suits/blazers that I purchase  Very fast and friendly service ,?
2274375,I have read the reviews this place has  and I do not feel the same  I went to this place three times by now  looking for a crib  a stroller and some other baby items  In all three times the staff was super nice and helpful  willing to explain about each product and even match prices (only if they have it in stock) Regarding that  I actually came in hoping to leave with a stroller but the salesperson told me that the ad that we found online has a newer stroller than they one they carry  so she could not match up the price for me  I was disappointed because I was REALLY hoping to leave with a stroller that day  but she said she could not do anything  Im giving this place three stars just because theyre kind of pricey and also because I was really hoping they could work things out for me and the stroller ,?
2274954,I have recently switched my salon to Hair Craft Salon where Sebastian brought great costumer service and well done experience on hair cut  If your confused who should you always go to for your hair cut  consult with Sebastian and Im sure it will be your stay  Affordable price and few mins away from subway  always best to call before walking in ,?
2275237,I have rented over a hundred cars in dozens of places in several cities and airports  I search prices and Budget normally has the best price   This particular location has the Blessing of Cathy the manager who I have dealt with 6 or so times   Very organized  very friendly and professional  Always a smile and Ive witnessed her defuse a disgruntled customer with ease and kept her cool  everyone was satisfied  This is a low key location which I also enjoy   I normally rent a car when I am taking a trip to keep miles off my baby ( 1995 Acura Legend Coupe LS ) which already has enough miles   so they let me park it in the back lot at the hotel which is very handy and I have never had any issues   the west valley is very safe ,?
2275872,I have seen a lot of chiropractors in my life so far and there is no one better than him he is best I have to recommend him to anyone that is having any kind of back pain he will not cheat you or tell you to keep coming to make money off of you hes very honest,?
2277198,I have some mixed feelings about this Irish bar  located in Town Square on the upper level  First  the upsides I was surprised at the number of mixed drinks they had considering this is not typical of an Irish bar  I tried the cherry limeade and the blueberry lemonade and both were refreshing drink choices  The McFaddens famous Irish nachos were probably the best item here  Interestingly  they are tater tots  which technically Irish nachos are normally fresh fried chips  With that said  they were very tasty with the cheese sauce and loaded with toppings  I always try to get something authentic to the cuisine  so I tried the chicken pot pie   Unfortunately  the crust was burnt on the ends  The serving size was large  but the gravy had an odd flavor  It needs some improvement ,?
2278065,I have stayed here a bunch when I visit PHX   I have always enjoyed my stay   The Jacuzzis used to be open late and now they are not  The staff seemed lackluster and all seemed like rookies   I pretty much gave up on the Buttes   I only stay at Marriott  I thought I would have to find a new spot   Then I went to the bar and met Samantha   What a treat  she is a pro   What I expected   She was very helpful  served great drinks  and restored my faith   Then I met Angel   Another pro  thanks so much you two!  I will be back again!,?
2278123,I have stayed here a few times  The last time there was a ton of construction and rerouting people  it got a little annoying  That being said  average wait time for check in when its busy and not check in time is anywhere from 1545 minutes  The staff at the desk is always friendly  I usually get the spa suite when I am here and love it to death   A downside to staying here is the rooms are about a 1015 minute walk to the pool   Not a lot of shade  better get there early if you want a spot in the shade   aside from a few minor things  I would defiantly stay here again,?
2278256,I have stayed here numerous times and have always had great service  the rooms are nice  the place is super clean and well maintained   The restaurant serves excellent food and the small bar is friendly and intimate  If you dont want a flashy casino and are looking for great value  family friendly atmosphere and first class service  you need look no further   I wont stay anywhere else in or near Las Vegas  A special thank you to the night manager Dave as he went to extra lengths to accommodate a large group of us traveling together just this past week and my friends are now loyal customers and will surely return and recommend to others ,?
2279110,I have taken each of my 3 kids iphones here for screen replacement  They are always very helpful and quick  I even purchased a used iphone5 that is in fantastic condition for much less than i could find anywhere  Im glad I found them ,?
2279164,I have taken my 3 pups to Deb for many years  Shes professional and kind  Shes a real dog advocate and lover  My pups look great every time  She loves on them and dotes on my schnauzer  Reservations are needed  Does not accept credit or debit cards ,?
2279686,I have taken two of my dogs here for shots and teeth cleaning/extractions  The vets and staff here are the best  I feel my babies are in the best of care  I would recommend American Pet Hospital to anyone ,?
2280063,I have thin hair and chose the Curly style  The stylist asked if I minded hair spray or product and I told her it was fine that I spray each strand before I curl it so that it will hold  When she finished  My hair was very flat on the top and by the time I got to my car it was falling in my face   I told her I wanted the curly style and that tomorrow  it would be the beachy wavey style  By the time I went out that evening  there was no curl and it was already the beachy  wavey style but very limp   I chose Drybar since I had something going on 2 nights in a row and heard they do a good job   Boy did I hear wrong  I would recommend that you do not waste your money ,?
2280872,I have to admit that this place has seen a dramatic downturn in the last year  This location was a full service car wash that washed and vacuumed while you waited inside  Now  its a flatrate ride through that lets you use the vacuums at the end  In the last few weeks  though  they added a spray polish that makes my car look great I get the wash  $5  the tires and wheels  $5  and the polish  $2  and the car leaves looking really good  Heres to continued good results!,?
2281374,I have to admit  I am so thankful that we found Wee Care Pediatric Dental  The staff is so caring  the Dr is a great dentist and is also very caring  They did a great job and made me feel at ease ,?
2281375,I have to admit  I have never heard of this place  A friend of mine  his dad was playing there  They were busy in the Restaurant  but had a few tables on the back patio empty  So we went back to the patio where we had people waiting for us and there were actually 2 additional people there as well who were not eating  but when the server walked by I tried to order and he told me I would have to wait 30 minutes because that is the waiting time  Well by the time I told my friends dad who was singing there  we finally got served our food  It was pretty good and a decent price  The Owner seemed to be a real nice guy  but his employees were terrible  awful  I always give a place a second chance otherwise I would have only given them one star ,?
2282301,I have to be honest  I am a regular at this location    but with reason  the service is great and the food is better than most for bar food  they do have a family  area which is always busy   but I travel alone   Stop by and try their daily specials (quite a few)  be sure to say hi to Liv  Sarah  Alexis &the rest of crew ,?
2282642,I have to concur with Shannon and Sarah on this one  In high school  we used to get out n Fridays at 12:30 and then we would rendezvous with our lady friends for lunch  There were an amazingly high number of awkward teenage lunches that took place at this Duck and Decanter  until one day I realized that I really dont like the food there  or anything about it really  It somewhat effectively passes itself off as a gourmet sandwicheria/deli but more by pricing everything high than serving good sandwiches  Ill still drop by from time to time and still have friends from high school that love it  I just dont think I ever will  Two and a half stars ,?
2283439,I have to give them a 1 star     worst experience ever! Ive uploaded pictures   I came in for a color change of hell    And got charged $27 Dollars for a color change    never again worse place Ive been  20min after leaving 2 nails broke from so much filling that they did on my nails,?
2283535,I have to give this groomer 5 stars   They were very nice to take my husky last minute with no appointment because they took 3 hours with him ! Other groomers only took 2 and I noticed it wasnt nearly up to the standards of groomer has it    The prices are much better than all the other groomers too ! My dog came back to me happy  smelled amazing and looked amazing   They also desheded him and Im noticing his shedding came down! Will be back and always will go here,?
2285723,I have to say that I am super impressed with this grooming salon/pet food store Let me first start by saying they are super friendly!  I dropped my two  dogs off this past saturday for a groom  and WOW did they look amazing!  So what was above and beyond   it was raining that day and the gentleman in the store offered to carry my pups to the car for me I also got a thank u card and magnet from the owner in the mail!  Wow!The grooming was unbelievable  Ive gotten so many compliments in my two babies;)  The price is definitely average but way above and beyond for how wonderful they look   I also luked that they tell you the price up front and dont have added on fees like some groomwrs Ive gone to have done Oh and the store is very clean and does not smell one bit  These are all extra plusses for me I highly recommend  Fluffs of Love;)  they definatel y take customer service and grooming to the next level!,?
2286178,I have to say that for the money this may be the best bang for your buck! A huge plate of QUALITY Chinese food for under $6 00??? Thats exactly what it is  I recommend this place to everyone I know and every time they say the same thing      Simply the best!,?
2286498,I have to say that this is my favorite brunch spot in Toronto!  Located right on the edge of Yorkville  they have a great menu and delicious food   The atmosphere is relaxing and inviting   The prices are very reasonable   I have never ever had bad service and did I mention that the food is amazing?!!!I dont think you can make reservations on Sundays but if you go after 12:301:00  you shouldnt have a problem getting a table   I highly recommend both the eggs benedict and the mushroom and goat cheese omelette   Yum!,?
2288109,I have to say  they have the best steak in Scottsdale  I would come here each time I was craving steak  I love the sports memorabilia and the fact that its so close to bars and clubs  If you are in Scottsdale and want to drink a lot and not get a hangover  eat steak here first  They have great appetizers and great service  Whats not to like about that?,?
2289365,I have totally fallen in love at Tuck Shop   Everything here is fantastic   My friend and I come here about twice a month and enjoy some snacks and wine   The beer battered Cheese Curds may just change your life for the better    we are seriously tempted to each get our own order  (I am not very good at sharing and i always get what I want!      No im not an only child    well  maybe I was until i was 11  how did you know   WAH!)   Oh  and Laura is fantastic   She always takes great care of us as we enjoy a glass of wine on the couch in the reading room   Thursdays special is meat loaf    dont deny yourself  just indulge   :),?
2290353,I have tried several different kinds of pizza here and never been disappointed   Tonight I tried the grilled chicken salad   again  I was not disappointed!  Generous portions  fresh ingredients  and prices that are reasonable   The service is always exceptional   I think the pizza is quite possibly the best I have ever eaten   I highly recommend this restaurant!,?
2290713,I have tried this place many times when I lived in McKees rock  Not friendly people  food could be good one day and horrible the next  Pricey  So many other local places that beat here  Also  take forever to get an order to your house  not during rush hour ,?
2291130,I have two boys going to Casy Preschool and we are very happy  One in 2s and the other in 3s  We toured other schools and we chose Casy because of the experienced teachers and curriculum  The teachers are all very experienced and have been there a long time  And it showed after our first year  The teachers are amazing! And we were so impressed with the curriculum  They both learned so much! They both love all the art and music  The owners couldnt be nicer and are so involved with each student  The teachers  staff and owners go above and beyond  The school is like family  They all are so caring and loving  Just the feeling you want  We also met so many great kids and parents  We give this school top rating ,?
2291614,I have used Arizona Vision multiple times   Dr Yamamoto is simply the best   He is the only eye doctor to who attempted diagnose spots on my eyes  and always checks to ensure the health of my eyes   I also recommended AV to my partner and he loves Dr  Young  on time  thorough and friendly   Will ony use Arizona Vision moving forward!,?
2291689,I have used Blair Ballin as my realtor 3 times and each time has been an A experience  He is a true professional and a trustworthy individual (which sorry to say isnt the case in my experience with lots of realtors)  Most recently  I used Blairs real estate services for the purchase of my current home  Even though there were multiple offers on the table and ours wasnt even the highest  Blair was able to develop a rapport with the sellers agent and get us the acceptance  Needless to say  we were escstatic and love our new place  If it wasnt for Blair  I dont think we wouldve been able to get it  I wouldnt hesitate to use Blair in any future real estate transactions and highly recommend him to anyone looking for a smart  savvy and trustworthy realtor ,?
2292013,I have used Estrella Mountain Plumbing for the last three years and they always provide quality service at a competitive price   If you need a plumber Id call them first!,?
2292488,I have used Noble Cleaners for several rentals and to clean the carpets in my own home and found them to be extremely efficient  well priced and on time!  They cleaned the carpet in one rental house that I thought that I would have to replace   they brought it back to life!  Gene and Ryan personally handle the care of your carpet   They are honest and reliable and I heartily recommend them!,?
2292492,I have used North Valley 2 times  Once years ago on my Amana Refrigerator and today on my Whirlpool Dryer  Roger does not waste your time  nor your money  Very reasonable price  plus he is quick  He is honest with you too ,?
2293550,I have used this Merry Maids group for years   They have great people in the office and wonderful teams of cleaners   Of course  some are better than others but I have yet to be disappointed by any of them   My home was the last one scheduled to be cleaned today by Yvonne and Lesly   They showed up with smiles and enthusiasm and you would have thought it was their FIRST one of the day!  Every nook and cranny in my home looks and smells wonderful!!  Kudos to them and to the owners for keeping such remarkable employees!,?
2293721,I have used this company in the past and have been completely satisfied In addition  I have referred this company on several occasions and have received 100 percent positive responses   Will continue to recommend this company ,?
2294198,I have vague memories of stopping here last year  so when my girlfriend and I were in the area I wanted to go again  I had the grilled cheese without onions  which was one of the best sandwiches I have EVER had  with the berry house salad  also amazing  The berries were somehow perfectly ripe  the goat cheese was delicious  and the dressing extraordinary  My girlfriend had the eggs benedict and a bowl of the tomato soup  She said the soup was good  but when I asked about the eggs they were indescribable  Absolutely wonderful  so Im guessing those were the star of the show  All in all  one of the best meals weve ever had  I would have immediately left this review if I had signal at the time  Well for sure be back ,?
2294579,I have visited Lucille more times than I can count  and thats the honest truth  I finally got around to visiting this restaurant with a group of friends  We were 7 total  and this was during their Wednesday date night special  We were seated immediately in an upstairs booth  Overall  the space is VERY accommodating for larger parties  The booth comfortably sat 7 of us  but a few more bodies definitely fit  Wednesday date night is such a steal  including: A bottle of bubbly  salad  pie of your choice  AND dessert  Three couplesthree bottles of sparkling winefantastic time  The restaurant was busy  filled with chatter   popping bottles  and delicious smells  Please make it a priority to order the pork nachos and the Painkiller cocktail  These are consistently fantastic  I also had the Five Cheese pie with the addition of bacon lardons  very tasty  I will be returning for sit down dinner very soon ,?
2295940,I have wanted to go to a Wolfgang Puck restaurant and now I did  Id give it a 3 5 star rating  It was good  not great   casual and simple  I got the signature pizza which was really good I might add  It had a flat thin crust with great tasting olives   great flavor!   The waiter was a bit slow which kinda bummed me out   I felt like there was nothing to wow me here but for some good food not a bad place  Convenient location ,?
2296885,I have yet to be disappointed by the food or the staff  Great atmosphere and great eats  My fave appetizers would be the Calamari and potstickers  And ofcourse the Bellini to accompany every meal  Lol,?
2296930,I have yet to eat here  good place to go for drinks Great draft beer selection  and their power hour is a deal  They had a Revolution Brewing beer on tap the past two times Ive been there  One of my favorite places to go around the Gateway District ,?
2297780,I havent been here for years  perhaps even a decade  I remembered it as being somewhat expensive but good I just went again last week and i was blown away  The flavours arent just good  theyre phenomenal and worth every penny ,?
2298354,I havent been in an FYE for a long time   I enjoyed having the time to look around in this one on the way home from Phoenix  They have all the CDs and DVDs very organized and are very helpful and knowledgeable   They also have a lot of tiein merchandise from movies   I found a Broadway CD with songs from various shows and one other CD (blanking on the artist)   Both were pretty inexpensive   I was looking for a certain used movie and they had it but it was $14 99 so I decided to pass   It was one Id probably only watch once so Ill just rent it or wait for it to come on HBO ,?
2298613,I havent been to Cheesecake Factory in two years   Wow  I forgot how great this restaurant is   Went here last night and it was great   Service was on top of everything   I ordered off the skinnylicous menu   I had the Shrimp Creole  it was great huge portion with great flavor   My wife had the salmon  it was a little dry but she still enjoyed   We didnt get any desert but I am still thinking about the Oreo Deluxe Cheesecake  it looked amazing ,?
2298787,I havent been to Monta Chaya for awhile    I had a huge craving for their Pork Belly Bowl! Im so glad that I decided to call in for an order of it    Oh how I missed this flavorful bowl of porky goodness!!!! The thinly sliced pieces of pork belly was so tender and melt in your mouth yummy in my tummy awesomeness!!!! I cant express how much I love pork belly! Monta Chaya also has great ramen! My personal favorite is the Tonkotsu Ramen    Sooo good!!! The Calamari is also good    Monta Chaya is my go to Ramen place especially since its just 10 minutes away from me    Great location! Customer service is also on point    Lurve this place!!!,?
2299760,I havent been to this restaurant for over 20 years   Its much as I remember it   Great service   A wide variety of foods   I am not a huge fan of buffets as I find the food can be luke warm at times   A lot of pasta (which is expected)   Meat sauce was tasty and meatballs were seasoned and very tasty Prices are more than what I would expect for a carb laden buffet  but there is a good variety and something here for everyone ,?
2300217,I havent even finished a purchase yet but my agent Cristina Grossu has been fantastic  I flew in to Charlotte to look at a number of places in a couple of days and she was able to show me 30 places within the short time frame  Shes stopped me from adding things into an offer that exposes me to too much risk; genuinely having my best interest in mind! If you need a realtor in Charlotte  I recommend her: grossuc@gmail com,?
2300615,I havent had Hakka in years  but gravitated here with fond memories of spicy fried dishes  The restaurant was clean and comfortable to dine in  Service was fast and prices reasonable given large portion size  As for taste  I expected a little more  but still enjoyed every dish This is a good spot for fast tasty Hakka ,?
2301325,I havent had there cupcakes in years so I thought Id drop by again but that was a mistake  I purchased 4 cupcakes for $14 & there EXTREMELY dry  There are beautiful to look at but exceptionally dry & messy to eat  I took one bite & it crumbly all over my shirt and onto my pants  The cake portions were bland and the frosting was regular  I purchased a Peanut Butter  Strawberry Lemonade  Carrot Cake  & a chocolate concoction  I expected WAY better but tasted nothing UPSCALE especially for the price *gave them 2 stars for presentation ONLY ,?
2301349,I havent had to stay in this place for long periods of time like other airports  but i hated the walk from Security area to the gate     it took FOR EVER!There seems to be some ok food there though ,?
2301625,I havent reviewed The Windsor yet? Shame on me!Before you enter  be very careful where you park  Pay attention to the signs in the residential streets  you will get ticketed  I almost always valet as I am impatient and lazy The architecture is similar to Postinos  it has that old woodmodernminimalrusticcharm feeling  The patio outside rocks  if weather allows sit outside  The food is wonderful  My favorite is the Bahn Mi fish sandwich  second favorite is the ribs  and of course the 5000 calorie porkwich is also delectable  The Vegetable Chop and Mixed Grain salads are wonderful and so is the Burger (order it Windsor style  trust me)   The bartenders are friendly  the drinks are stiff and the wine list is hefty  This has become one of my Cen Pho Favorite Spots ,?
2302120,I havent updated my resume in 5 years and the thought of doing it myself was daunting  so Im so glad I found Perfect Resume! I had an initial phone conversation with Stephanie where she did some light career coaching by listening to where Im currently at in my career and what Im thinking of doing next and helped steer me in the right direction  I completed a very thorough questionnaire and the final product is a very detailed resume document that Im confident will get me noticed by recruiters and I for sure could have never put together myself  If youre looking for new opportunities and need to revise your resume  save yourself from running around in circles and hire these guys to do it right the first time around ,?
2302296,I havent written a yelp review in a long time but this called for one  Why is there so many good reviews? I dont understand what is so good here  The iced tea is powdered  the orange juice is from a box  the water is from tap  The tables are set up in the most bizarre way its uncomfortable  Ordered eggs  potatoes  bacon and a side of pancakes  The potatoes were undercooked and bland  Bacon I couldnt eat as it was overcooked and cheap  The pancake was nothing to write home about  And do they put MSG in their food?! Left with a dry mouth and headache  Will never ever return ,?
2302600,I hear Burger King is buying Popeyes (or at least BKs parent company)  Shame  because that may mean a drop in quality  So I plan to make it up to this Popeyes more frequently in the coming weeks and months to get their delicious spicy fried chicken out of my crave zone Recently  I came here after work because I needed some comfort food in the form of crispy fried chicken  As Popeyes isnt really nearby  but is my favorite chicken chain  I made a special trip to get an 8 piece for that night  and a 3 piece meal for the following days lunch  Its more frugal to do it this way  Trust me  The spicy chicken was crispy on the outside and relatively moist on the inside  Nothing a little dipping sauce didnt fix  The green beans were perfectly smoky  and the biscuit really doesnt need butter (but I recommend it anyway) Make your way to your nearest Popeyes before BF busts the good thing Popeyes has going ,?
2304308,I heard many amazing stories about this place and I finally got a chance to check it out last weekend  Everything there was absolutely amazing  Just delicious  My only complaint is that I wish it was closer to where I live (Sq Hill) and had more evening hours  I would be going there every week at least! The fact that its in Millvale limits my ability to go  I wish hed open a second bakery in the East End!!!,?
2304341,I heard mixed reviews; its certainly for a progressive sexually positive crowd   There was nothing too graphic   Beautiful men and women; lots of breasts  butts  but no vag or penis   Why?  LolLots of comedy and beware where you sit;   Closer to stage or aisle seats and you could end up on stage    It was a good evening    Beautiful music and the cello player is phenomenal ,?
2305559,I held a team dinner in the loft last week for 35 guests and the restaurant pulled it off flawlessly   The service was impeccable  the space was perfect and the food was delicious  seriously  all 35 people loved the food   hard to do for a diverse group!  Our meal was served family style and we enjoyed in the gnudi  shrimp ceviche  Therapys signature salad  Scottish salmon  sliced chimichurri steak  fire roasted corn  brussels sprouts  mac n cheese  smores and carrot cake   It was an abundance of food  but worth every calorie!,?
2306466,I highly recommend Deacon and FSequence Studio to anyone in the Vegas area looking for a fun  creative  and easy peasy photographer! He and Sarah  a wonderful make up artist  put together professional  tailor made sessions that dont disappoint  While working on the Were Alive photo shoot  I got to see them in action with the other actors as well as being in front of his lens myself  Its important to me that whoever I work with has just the right mix of humor  positive attitude  sound work ethic  and a keen eye  And thats what you get with FSequence Thank you Deacon and Sarah for an awesome photo shoot!,?
2306775,I highly recommend Grassroots! I am from the south originally and this place is a pleasant reminder of the delicious food I left behind  Shrimp & Grits are excellent if your into grits  and you have to get the pork belly appetizer  If the weather is nice try and get a table on their patio ,?
2306787,I highly recommend Habaneros! They have great guacamole and AWESOME pork tacos  For the price  it cant be beat  Their salsa is bland  And the waiters/waitresses came over every 5 minutes to check up on us  Which was really annoying  but it turned comical  Im pretty sure they werent communicating with one another about how often service was stoping by our table  Oh well  Id rather have eager service than lazy service  My husband got fajitas and the chicken was marinated beautifully  For the value  this place is a home run ,?
2307504,I highly recommend Umbrella movers! The receptionist on the phone was really professional and pleasant  Tonathiu and Mark were extremely efficient and got everything set up in well under the time we expected  All in all a great experience was had and I plan to continue business with them for any future moves ,?
2307769,I highly recommend him  He has checked our AC/Heat twice and fixed one of the AC issues  We had him recently install a new thermostat  He is dependable and fair as to what the issues are if any  Reasonable rates ,?
2308162,I highly recommend these guys  I had a crack in my water main line  The tech  Xavier  showed up early  Handled the problem efficiently and professionally  And stuck to the quoted price  even though the situation called for more work than expected  Theyre a solid company  I will definitely use them again  But more importantly will recommend them to my friends  And in the long run  that means more than this review ,?
2308808,I highly recommend this place  Clean  friendly staff and great massage  We got the one hour reflexology foot massage  They do your shoulders  head arms also  This is an amazing deal  I cant wait to go back ,?
2308882,I highly recommend this place  The views are outstanding and the food was wonderful  Service was topnotch as well  We recently went for our anniversary and my wife and I had a perfect evening  She ordered the chicken  I know boring  but it was excellent  At the suggestion of our server  I ordered the pork chop and it was overthetop  Perfectly cooked  bonein  and huge! We both had the purple potatoes with smoked Gouda as a side to our dish and it rivaled the protein   Interestingly they opened with homemade popcorn which I had never seen and it was delicious  By the way  bread service was great and they served a tomato pesto that could have been a main course! Outstanding!,?
2308913,I highly recommend this practice! The dentist  hygienist  and office staff are very thorough  attentive  and proficient  I was very impressed that everyone was so friendly  that the hygienist was so thorough  and especially that the dentist (Stephanie) actually took time to have a real conversation before my exam  Unlike my experience at other dentists  my appointment didnt feel rushed  which was refreshing and welcome  Everyone from the front desk to the billing department is terrific  Its obviously a well run and pleasant office environment because everyone seems happy to be there  The office is very clean  and welcoming  and the exam rooms appear to be state of the art  I had my teeth cleaned  Xrays taken  and they even squeezed me in for a filling the very next day!,?
2309428,I hired 2 movers to help me unload a moving truck into my apartment  JC was responsive and flexible  The movers were punctual  They handled my belongings carefully  Made sure to place everything in the correct rooms  When one piece of furniture didnt fit up the stairs  JC was willing to disassemble and reassemble the whole piece in order to get it to the desired room  Overall I was very satisfied and would use their services again or recommend them to a friend ,?
2309609,I hired Clean Tastic for housecleaning  They were Fantastic! Great pricing and they were very thoughtful about what I needed  I was very impressed how they offered choices of different cleaning products to choose from in case of allergies and they made sure i was happy with all aspects of the cleaning  When they left I had a sparkling clean home!They were kind  professional and I plan to use them on an ongoing basis ,?
2309769,I hired Invention Home to seek out a licensing deal with potential companies for my invention  Invention Home failed to give me any evidence whatsoever it provided the service it claims to provide  I have communicated with them multiple times to request they provide any evidence of their service  and have received absolutely nothing verifiable  I actually was even threatened by one of their employees; she told me that since I was complaining and asking for verification of their service  they would in turn tell any potential licensing company that I was difficult to work with and would affect my chances for a licensing deal  Buyer be very aware!,?
2311211,I honestly didnt realize this place is a steakhouse  I can only speak on what we ordered  which was sushi  Because it wasnt too busy  the sushi chef came up to our table and talked to us about the sushi menu  He asked what we were in the mood for  what fish we like  what ingredients we dont like  if we like spicy or not  etc  He recommended items based on what we told him  which we then ordered  Fortunately  he knew what he was talking about because the sushi that he made for us were all quite tasty  The rolls that we ordered were Sunshine  Vegas (basic  I know)  Fatboy  Golden Spider  and the Osaka Roll  which is pricier than the rest but worth it because it comes with a whole lobster tail  It was an excellent meal that we topped off with some dessert items (macaroons and tempura ice cream   delicious)  I would highly recommend this place because of the sushi chef  Pocholo  Thanks man!,?
2312204,I honestly loved Amandas work  To see people posting on how she is rude and abrasive is really odd to me  The final pictures were amazing  She is gentle and patient with the babies  I was nervous that my little one wouldnt cooperate but she had all the tricks to make baby comfortable and able to take some really adorable pictures  I thought she was someone I could talk to about my concerns and just told me to trust her and sure enough my newborn pictures were beautiful and everything I wanted and more  She was herself and not fake which I appreciate no matter business or friend  She gave me her honest opinion and I valued that  So if people think thats her being rude then go with someone who is just in it for your money  Will be going back for more photos  I recommend her whole heartedly ,?
2312532,I honestly wish I could give this place 20 stars! Places like this do still exist  and its awesome! The place itself is almost like being back home  and seeing your loved ones  They welcomed us with open arms  and treated us like family  The food was AMAZING!!!! The owners were AWESOME!!! The wait staff was extremely attentive and made sure we had everthing we needed  Feeneys is to me  a diamond in the ruff  We cannot wait to come back for more!,?
2312827,I hope people read the reviews! Jim tried to disqualify my review by calling it fake  What?!? What about all the other reviews claiming the same unethical practices? Are they all fake  too?,?
2313212,I hope you have a fast car sitting at home before you shit yourself everything tasted so weird in the bathroom whats up with the bathroom its disgusting you cannot use it its gross,?
2313379,I hosted a meeting here  and the service was amazing   My attendees said that the guest rooms were very nice  too Charlotte hotels are VERY expensive  especially for the fact that there is nothing in Charlotte   They gave me a good rate  provided the size of my group The restaurant was OK; they started using those gross powdered eggs in the breakfast buffet  so Id avoid it   Also  the bar is EXTREMELY expensive   Three of us had two drinks each  and it came out to $80 00   WTF?!Its in a lessthannice area  but the Crowne Plaza is an oasis; you will be safe and comfortable ,?
2315086,I juggled between 3 and 4 stars but decided on giving 4 for all the times i have had roll parathas from this resturaunt  This places is typically packed on weekend evenings ,?
2315533,I just ate here for the first time but it certainly wont be the last! The customer service was very good especially for how busy the place was ,?
2316256,I just broke my iPhone 5s screen this morning  I texted for a quote  brought the phone in the afternoon  and had my screen fixed in less than a half hour! Thank you for the quick and quality service!,?
2316447,I just called to ask a question about repair work and the lady was rude and says you will have to bring the whole unit in  I said Thank you and she just hangs upAlso everytime we go in at the back service desk they are also rude and not much help  They will order a part and have you pay for it but then you have to go way elsewhere to pick up the part  We said we will just buy the part where we have to pick it up ,?
2317704,I just did a float here today and was very pleased with everything  This was my first time and they were very helpful in guiding me through the process and answering my questions  The facility was nice and extremely clean  The float session was fantastic and I recommend it for everyone to try  I will absolutely be back here again ,?
2318455,I just expected more  Idk  it was expensive and the burger was just ok  Fries were also just ok  I will have to give it another shot but was not overly impressed especially not with the price ,?
2318485,I just experienced my worst manicure/pedicure ever   The female technician did not honor my requests   My nails  for example  were not cut to the level I clearly indicated   She also cut the top of my toe with one of her brushes   It was a significant bleed  but the technician failed to take the required precautions to stop the bleeding   She applied solutions with her bare hands   When the bleeding continued  I had to prompt her to apply a bandaid   The first two bandaids slipped off because they could not adhere to the solutions she had applied   At the end of my session  a larger bandaid was applied to a dry toe and it stayed in place   I will never go to Kennys again ,?
2318530,I just feel so meh about Sweet Melissas   Its kind of a place that makes me angry it exists because it doesnt know what it wants to be   Ive dined in many times and I always leaves thinking why did I come here?  I think I just want to like it so bad because they have a lot of vegetarian options and a pretty dessert case My last experience was definitely my last though   They fucked up tacos   Which is just rude rude rude  First dont have tacos on your menu   Just dont   We have too many mediocre taco places in this town   (Im looking at you  Barrio)  And if you must have them on your menu they better be impressive and delicious and reasonably priced   Get out of my life  Sweet Melissa!Actually  the entire city of Rocky Rive can fall off the face of the planet as well Thank you and good day ,?
2319496,I just got a new puppy and was recommended to them  They are so friendly and caring  Recommend them to all pet owners ,?
2319753,I just got back from an appointment with Haley  and I am extremely happy with my cut!  Ive been wanting to get bangs for a while now and finally decided to  still with some hesitation   Haley was extremely helpful in helping me decide how to get them cut and suggesting what would look best   She also made sure to ask me as she was going if I liked how they looked   The rest of the cut looks amazing as well  I couldnt be happier!  Plus  as a poor college student  the price for a cut with her is very reasonable ,?
2319801,I just got back from lunch at Craft 64   Love it!  Decor is really nice (some gorgeous oak tables and an awesome wine case) and the restaurant is open and airy   Cool patio   My Scottsdale Blond beer was very light and tasty   The Kale salad and carne pizza were outstanding   Youve gotta try this place   Such nice restaurant staff nothing pretentious here!,?
2319950,I just got delivery and the food was just OK   Chicken Marsala was decent nothing special and the gnocchi pasta was bad Pasta didnt feel fresh missing those tastebuds that u would hope to experience while eating Italian food ,?
2320745,I just got out of this restaurant after witnessing this sushi guy (midage Asian dude) serving sushi items after picking up pieces of salmon on the ground after he dropped them  He looked around to see if anyone saw him dropping those salmon  I guess he didnt see me  Do not eat their sushi or any of their food  I will never come back  Disgusting ,?
2320901,I just gotta say  serving fresh hot flatbreads from a tandoor makes all the difference in the world!!  Helps that the meats placed on top are just as good!,?
2321055,I just had Russ out today to fix my patio door they were very courtesy and extremely reasonable   They fixed my door and it glides so effortlessly that I almost sent it sailing after being use to bracing myself to apply all my weight to open it previously!  I would recommend Southwest Patio Door Repair to everyone!,?
2321735,I just had an awesome experience with Anthony! He was super personable and easy going  Couldnt help but mention it! Keep it up!,?
2321736,I just had an awful experience at Davids Bridal  and Im going to write this post so hopefully people can avoid the same thing happening to them  As soon as I mentioned to the bridal consultant what my budget was ($900 ) and that my wedding was in June (four months from now ) she totally clocked out  She showed me a dress  said that was all that was available  and when I asked her if I could explore other options she told me youve run out of time to explore  I was only with her 10 minutes before she said she couldnt help me anymore   which was doubly annoying because I had to wait an extra 20 minutes past my appointment time for her to finish her lunch  which she continued chewing while introducing herself All I can say is   if youd like to be treated well at Davids Bridal  say youre budget is a hella lot more than youre willing to pay  and pretend your wedding is much farther away than it is  so theyll take you seriously ,?
2322288,I just had my first appointment here today and I was extremely impressed   Never have I had a medical professional spend as much time with me as Dr  Farmer  After his initial look at my teeth he sat me down in a consultation room to go over my Xrays on the computer with him  He explained exactly what he was looking for and answered all of the questions I had   Dr  Farmer and his team let me know that if I ever needed anything I could text or call his personal cell phone at any hour  A true class act  I am excited to have found such an amazing practice that is local  Outstanding experience ,?
2323084,I just had the best dozen oysters that Ive had in many many years!  And what really surprises me it was not in new oreleans not on the East Coast or the West Coast but Phoenix!!!They were plump  sweet and perfectly chilled  they were to die for Also had an order of fried oysters and frog legs   Breading was a cornmeal  not my usual flour dusting  but still good   Service was excellent by the very friendly staff   I will definitely be back soon,?
2323276,I just had the jalapeno beer and fried pickles  Really good  not too salty and the jalapeno beer was bomb  Definitely not too spicy with a strong aroma of jalapeno Friend had a tuna sushi burger on rice buns  they were like flatbread  really cool and the sandwich itself had a great sauce but slightly overwhelmed with leaves ,?
2323363,I just had the most incredible facial by my amazing esthetician Leah! My skin always feels so brand new after she is done with me  She uses the best products  her technique is unmatched  and her new salon is so beautiful! My next appointment cant come soon enough!,?
2323412,I just had the new Rebalance treatment  Love it  My skin feels great ,?
2323643,I just had this company build a custom wooden mantel as well as 4 floating shelves  to match around our fireplace   Oscar  the owner  is very nice and professional   He built exactly what we wanted   He even made a suggestion about how we could mount our TV above our fire place on a wooden panel and then made us the panel and came back the next day to install it   He went above and beyond my expectations and has very reasonable prices   Highly recommend!,?
2323955,I just happened to stop here because I was craving some food with some serious flavor and I havent had Jamaican food in forever  When you first get there youre greeted by the Jamaican flag that lets you know youre in the right spot  When I walked in there were only a couple of customers there  of course since theyre a new spot  I just wanted to try the basics to see what they were about so I got a togo order of curry chicken and I also ordered a beef patty Ill be honest  the best thing from my meal was the beef patty  The rice and peas wasnt bad  a little dry but flavorful  I only had a couple pieces of chicken  a thigh and a leg that were extra small  there was no curry sauce  mainly oil and there was no flavor to the cabbage Prices were fairly average  ranging between $10$15  Would I try them again? Maybe  but I think Ill let them get settled in first ,?

2326244,I just love what Brittany did to my hair!  She listened to what I had in mind and suggested things that made my style even better!  I recommend Glow for anyone who wants to be treated like they are the most important client they have ,?
2326749,I just moved here and had to get a new drivers license  This wasnt a bad experience at all  I went on a Tuesday around 3 and only waited for 20 minutes before being helped by a very nice and sweet lady  Like most things  if you have a bad attitude that normally makes those helping you have a bad attitude as well  Be polite and patient and youll have a good experience ,?
2326818,I just moved here from CA and I have had the same brow lady for 5 years  I was nervous about Finnish a new one  My brow lady started as a benefit brow girl so I figured it would be my best choice  Erika did not disappoint!! Not only to brows look great she was enjoyable to be around  Really sweet and funny  Thanks for giving me back my benefit brow arch! I will definitely be returning to see Erika!!,?
2327851,I just moved to Madison and took my Honda Accord in for a fuel emmissions leak  He was very honest and descriptive and told me that it is not a huge problem and that I am better off saving my $ than getting it fixed  This was the second opinion that I got (I went to Terrys Car Care first and they told me that to go any further it would cost atleast $400 and that I might need a new gas tank)  Morale of the story   take your car here!,?
2329728,I just purchased a Miele vacuum from Garren at AZ Vacuum  He was so knowledgeable and patient  The vacuum works beautifully  Thanks  Garren!,?

2330428,I just recently  bought  a Kindle and the screen would not turn ba k on  I was told by Kindle support that  the problem  was not fixable and that I would have to buy a new tablet  I was very upset but found Ubreakifix online and made the trip to Charlotte NC to see them  They fixed the problem in less than 5 min   You guys ROCK!!!!!,?
2332977,I just tried the panfried combination gyoza (shrimp and leek pork corn mushroom in flour wraps is how its described on the menu)  YUM!! Just the ticket when youre craving dumplings  Im looking forward to working my way the rest of the menu  which is short and specialized in dumplings  noodles  and fried hand pies (xianbing)  Its a nofrills  food stand experience  but the prices are good  as is the food  They also sell 40pic bags of frozen dumplings for $1015 (havent tried those yet  but might soon) ,?
2333009,I just tried this company for the first time today and my home looks absolutely incredible!! :) They paid attention to the smallest details and did such a fantastic job  I live in a high rise and it can be difficult arranging a key drop off etc  but they made it SO easy & convenient for a single gal who works all the time! So grateful to have found them & will definitely use again :),?
2333301,I just visited Hooley House  and both the food and service were pretty terrible   My wings had floppy skin and flavorless meat   I also tried the reuben with mac & cheese   The corned beef was actually pretty tasty; but the griddled bread was too greasy and couldnt stand up to the juices in the sandwich   Even though I ate my sandwich right away  the bottom piece of bread on my sandwich was a soggy mess   The mac & cheese was fine  but nothing Id want to eat again   My server was MIA after taking my order  letting food runners bring my food while he chit chatted in the kitchen (I could see directly in there from the bar area)   So  my awful wings and wish for a side of thousand island were not addressed   Just yuck ,?
2333379,I just visited the The polished nail bar at Stonecrest shopping center for the third time  As much as I would like to return there to get my nails done I cant justify it  My pedicure lasted all of 15 minutes  The nail technician was extremely rushed  She was more interested in socializing with the nail technician next to her then paying attention to my feet  My feet sat in the water for a total of two minutes  My cuticles were not soft enough to begin clipping  It was somewhat painful and not enough cuticle was removed  I asked for a straight edge on my toenails and she proceeded to cut sides  This is the worst looking pedicure I have ever received ,?
2333889,I just want to give this place props because even on black friday  THE busiest of all shopping days  i received friendly  worldclass customer service  usually i feel a little intimidated shopping in NMs  but this time around I received loads of assistance  and the ladies were all very friendly and helpful  I almost forgot that im not worth a million bucks ,?
2334097,I just want to say how much I appreciate this place for making an offmenu vegetarian item for me  The server was super nice about this  and I wound up having a great time ,?
2334333,I just want to say  that I was not looking forward to going and picking out my wedding dress  I wanted to get in and get out  I had made an appointment and was met with Jenny  Jenny picked out a few dresses for me and we were on our way to trying them on  She helped me in and out of the dresses and picked up on what I might like  Jenny made this daunting experience  a very enjoyable one  I felt so at ease and so relieved with the help of Jenny  If you are you are looking for a dress  please give Jenny at Davids Bridal on W  Sahara a chance  You wont regret working with her ,?
2334688,I just wanted to Thank Tara  Francine  Elvis & Pedro I just wanted to Thank You all for the great service and quick response  On Tuesday  21318 I put in a service request on the Martinique Bay website  I later called the office and Tara answered and confirmed the service request  That day Elvis came out to check our water heater and said that Good call  as it is ready to go  The next day  21418  Elvis and Pedro replaced our water heater and did an excellent professional job ,?
2335316,I just wanted to update again because its been a while and I have to say I have always had a good experience here  I know the reviews seem to vary  probably mainly with the endless debate of is this authentic Mexican  But really all I know is that it was delicious food I love the family style tacos theyre offering right now  That means you order your meat and then it comes with all the fixins to share with your dining partner  We ordered the carne asada and fish tacos  The carne asada was bomb! So flavorful! I thought the fish was good  but could have used a little more seasoning  I love their cocktails too  Its rare you can get a well made tequila cocktail without it being a sugary sweet mix of something as horrifying as Daileys mix  But we watched as they squeezed the limes themselves!Id like to come more often for the tequila flights  Ive gotta study my tequila:),?
2335687,I just went here last weekend with my parents and wow what fun we had! There are many different projects that you can choose from  they have a great variety  I like how everyone can be working on something different  but still be in one class  You can also customize your artwork/template which is pretty neat   They had everything set up for you when you arrived and the instructor was friendly and helpful with her instructions The only thing I thought was weird was that no one really greeted you once you walked in or asked if you had been there before or done anything similar  My parents had been here before but it was my first time  Everyone else was kind of just standing around as well  All in all though it was a blast! Will definitely be back ,?
2335784,I just went in for my first massage ever and let me tell you Knots Therapeutic Relaxation did you he job for me  My appointment was at 230   she brought me in at 220 and it was one of the most relaxing moments Ive had  I highly recommend Nicole for your next massage!,?
2336131,I just went to Lakewood Chiropractic for the first time and woah  I cannot wait to return! This is the first time in five years that I have been to a chiropractor and I wish I went earlier  Dr  Van Oosten is very personable and easy to talk to (unlike SO many doctors that Ive come across)  He was understanding  empathetic and provided me with recommendations that suit my needs  He adjusted my whole body  from my shoulders to my ankles  I feel amazing! He recommended that I come back next week to get adjusted again and then after that  maybe once a month or every other month  He is clearly an honest person and wants his patients to come back only when they need to  I am looking forward to my visit next week!,?
2340456,I know my asian food well enough to tell you that this place is horrible   The first thing we ordered were the egg rolls   Not bad  so I thought to myself our entrees wouldnt be so bad   F**k no   I ordered the lemongrass chicken   Simple dish to prepare and they couldnt even get that right   Maybe cause the cooks werent asian   The chicken was frostbitten and dry   I was like are you kidding me   The manager came over and asked me if everything was ok because she didnt see me eating my food    She asked me if  I  wanted something else and I said   not after what you just served me   My friend tried one of the pho dishes and the broth was watery and the meatballs were hard   I think ive said enough about this place   No sense keep writing when there are much better places I could be eating at and writing about ,?
2340614,I know people are raving about the nachos but I went here a couple of weeks ago and nachos were BLEH  Honestly  the cheese is not hearty and is kind of just like melted plastic on chips  Nothing blended well and there was no flavour  The sour cream on top didnt help spice things up   I mean  if youre paying that price for nachos you should go somewhere else ,?
2341757,I know this isnt a place for vegetarians  but I do appreciate the fact that Michael Symon offers vegetarian and vegan options   I just wish I liked them more For lunch I had a half grilled cheese sandwich and some tomato soup   The grilled cheese was thin and nicely toasted  but nothing that blew me away  The soup was fresh and nicely seasoned  but just fine   Overall nothing to get too excited about Vegetarians and vegans who eat here with carnivore friends will have some options and will come away satisfied  if not overjoyed ,?
2341997,I know this place just opened but come on    First the slowest drive thru ever   Also the food was very poor  The coleslaw had no sauce  the chicken had a burnt oil smell and the lemonade was terrible like previous reviews it tasted like tap water with chlorine in it   I have been to many Raising Cains before and I am a huge fan but this location better step up the quality or I will go elsewhere   I dont like to complain but this was bad ,?
2343332,I left Canyon Ridge Endodontics yesterday evening after being fit in for an emergency root canal   Dr  P and staff were friendly and professional   Even with a terrible abscess  the procedure was painless!  I will definitely refer my family and friends here and will return  if needed  in the future!,?
2343925,I lied  After saying Id never go back to Sports Authority convenience won out and I stopped in for a new pair of kicks  David sought me out immediately and was incredibly helpful  taking the time to understand what activities I was really going to be using the shoe for before directing me to three or four of his personal picks  He even talked me out of a more expensive pair of New Balance in favor of some discounted Asics  which I love  Checkout is still a bit of a mess but Davids exemplary service warranted this updated review ,?
2344165,I like Boston Market but there isnt one close to home so its a bit of a drive  I got the Quarter White rotisserie chicken with mashed potatoes  mac & cheese  and cornbread  It was pretty good  The mashed potatoes are like homemade (not instant)  The cheese sauce in the macaroni tastes very similar to KFC    not a bad thing  I did have some trouble with the drinks  I wanted to make an Arnold Palmer with raspberry lemonade but it was coming out clear  and the tea was too strong on its own  But good meal overall ,?
2344451,I like Dennys for breakfast  that right  I like it especially on my birthday HA!  3 stars is AOK in my book  I really like the coffee and this location isnt the nicest that I have been to but the service is always good here and you cant really screw up breakfast   I enjoy the grand slam now that you can get it your way  I just get the eggs  sausage  oatmeal  & wheat pancakes are pretty darn good   I do wish they had cottage cheese but that is a personal preference really   I just like to read the newspaper and have a meal here during the week since my office is nearby  of course the food always comes out so quick that I usually have to do both at the same time but I am not complaining ,?
2345416,I like Pikes!I stopped in for brunch today after passing the shop multiple times every time I ride LYNX into the city   I arrived just after 10:00 and had no problem finding a parking spot as things were pretty quiet   I was seated quickly and greeted just as quickly by my waiter  Justin I chose the buffet which had the advantage of staring me down as soon as I walked in the front door   The breakfast side of the buffet runs the entire front portion of the front counter  with the lunch side along the wall on the right The food was good  with the only strike being the hash browns  which were more like a hashbrown casserole (a la Cracker Barrel) The service was fantastic   Justin was on top of things throughout the meal   Plates were removed quickly and my water was refilled in a very timely manner The price jumps $5 00 after 10:00am and Im not certain if its worth it   The breakfast portion is definitely worth it  and next time Ill make it a point to stop by earlier ,?
2346081,I like ZTejas  but I just cant get past the just average seafood enchiladas   Its short on taste  short on seafood  and big on spinach and other filler  See Barrio and Tradiciones for kick ass seafood enchiladas The decor is very upscale chainy  but I dig the AZ  NM  TX flags   its a nice display even though it is designed to remind you youre at a Southwestern place   Subtlety  everyone  subtlety Since then Ive ordered differently   You cant go wrong with their chicken avocado sandwich   But I do have top say  I get excited thinking about the queso  cornbread and the catfish beignet   I dont know what they do to the catfish or the beignet crustorama  but it makes me giddy come time for each ZTejas visit   As for the cornbread  Ill second Maxs comment about it   I cant speak to the margaritas though    since Im usually there for business lunches or business dinners   Hiccup  um what was that  boss?,?
2346425,I like cafe rio but dont like this location   The bathroom was nasty! The customer service was awful and the food was bland   No need to go into a lengthy story of my experience but I just felt the need to warn you ,?
2346901,I like dollar stores because you can buy so much stuff for so little   I buy all of my cleaning supplies  toiletries  some food items  candy  seasonal  party balloons  wrapping paper  party supplies  office supplies  & greeting cards at Dollar Tree   The products are the same quality you will find anywhere else  for only a buck   Unlike some of the other dollar stores where things cost more than a dollar  everything at Dollar Tree is a dollar   This store has added more and more made in USA products  which I prefer   I try to buy made in USA products whenever I can  lets keep the jobs in America!  If you are tired of the high prices at the grocery and drug stores like I am  Dollar Tree is the place for you   This is the next best thing to extreme couponing   The only things that I dont recommend buying are the honey  & spices   The honey is just flavored corn syrup & the spices have fillers like corn in them   Overall  still a good store!,?
2347014,I like everything about this spot  Thanks  Yelpers for the recommendation! Sitting on the porch with a garden fresh salad and artisan iced tea enjoying the misters and good music ,?
2347184,I like going in this my local branch bank  Tito is an excellent manager and Eli is very good to  But Venessa is SUPERB  She has the best customer service skills EVER    what a DOLL  She treats every customer like a they have a million dollars in the bank ,?
2347913,I like it here  When Im craving some katsu or some spicy tuna  Ill come here  Pretty cheap  My hubby enjoys this place ,?
2347921,I like it here   the salads are good & fresh   The wings not bad and a very good Haddock!  This is a normal go to when I cant decide what I want  but want options   The wait staff is pretty cool too ,?
2348065,I like it  defiantly better than other location on Cedar Rd  Very clean  new  People are nice,?
2348495,I like pad thai I really do   And that is about as much as I know about thai food That being said  I do like Touch of thai   The staff is always friendly and the food is always tasty However  there are two shrimp on my pad thai   Only one when my husband takes his shrimp that I am pretty sure were written into our vows when we wed   It went something like    In sickness and health  to always give me a shrimp off your plate  till death do us partAnyway  a couple more wouldnt kill them Also  the place is kind of     well     run down?  The decor is a bit out of date  there are strange stains in strange places     the bathroom is    well  not nearly as bad as a gas station in Blythe  but not awesome either But  the food is good  A little mild  come on guys I can handle it ,?
2349823,I like the all the cashiers lately   very friendly specially this guy named Ron ,?
2349928,I like the atmosphere and I loved the side dishes of MacNCheese w/ Bacon  and the Garlic Spinach    I was a bit disappointed with the Seabass  especially given the price    Ive had much better    If I was a steak eater  maybe Id like it better (my friend really enjoyed his 24 oz steak)   I liked the loud music  but one of my friends thought it was a bit too loud to enjoy the conversation    Id go back if others really wanted to  but Id prefer to try someplace else next time ,?
2349934,I like the atmosphere and that this place is close to my house  For me thats as far as it goes  Theres definitely much better coffee and service to be had  My order has been incorrect on 2 occasions and even though I brought it to the attention of the cashier I still paid (10) for it ,?
2350160,I like the black lady that works here! She always make me laugh and she is always in a good mood!,?
2350488,I like the concept  I like their food  I wish they prices were more reasonable   but its hard and expensive to bring fresh labster from Main  5 stars ,?
2350549,I like the cozy front parlour in this place  it seems so nice and inviting and the staff here is usually very nice I do love the atmosphere here and I wish I could give this place 4 stars but the truth is I personally find their selection of books a little unbalanced  There is a huge section of comics  mystery books and even historical fiction  Sadly there is not much in the humour section and no media  pop culture or philosophy books ,?
2351047,I like the food at this restaurant but they do not deliver like it says! They need to change the info  Service is just OK ,?
2351132,I like the food here but they should never have dine in service   I sat and watched as order after order of take out went out the door while the trays for those dining in did not move   After 40 minutes of waiting I finally went up to complain and they basically brushed me off   This place should be take out only ,?
2351183,I like the food here  Hot and chilli fish  chicken lollipops and manchuria sauce chicken both dry and wet is a must try  Price is descent and they also deliver  This place is kind of a small version of Inchin bamboo  It has the Indian version of chinese street food,?
2351887,I like the new feel of this store  More open and friendly than some other Harris Teeters  I find that the meat and deli area to be very helpful and clean ,?
2352379,I like the sales (especially clearance prices) they offer but I shop at Hobby Lobby more often for a few reasons 1   This store is usually in some state of disarray when I go 2  The aisles seem a bit narrow and are tall and it feels a bit claustrophobic 3  There is a manager who sometimes works the cash register who is RUDE to customers  She doesnt greet you  she gives no eye contact  she will put your change on the counter  and when your transaction is concluded  she does NOT say thank you or respond to your thank you   She just walks away ,?
2352496,I like the setting of the restaurant  Will recommend having their t bone  chicken or beef stew but dont order their king fish! The waiter was friendly but doesnt write your order down and either brings wrong food or forgets your order ! Will probably recommend someone to try it out ,?
2353361,I like their skillets for breakfast  The biscuits and gravy is good  I actually didnt like their fish tacos  Theyre lacking in flavor and the tortillas have a weird texture  They fall apart too easily and theyre too mealy? I dont know exactly how to describe it  Service is good  The place is nice  not too spacious though ,?
2353536,I like thirsty lion but they need better taps   When I order  $7 beer Id like a full glass   This is without taking a drink!  I never have this problem at other bars  ,?
2353758,I like this Nordstrom but often find myself looking instead of buying here   They occasionally have good sales on mens shirts   They have an extensive suit collection that will hurt your wallet   They have very nice shoes but I tend to like Neiman Marcus better  i e   no Gucci  no Tods  no Prada (although Gucci & Prada can make some really buttugly shoes themselves)   They both carry Ferragamo   The Santonis are nice with ultra soft leather if you can find an attractive pair    The Bruno Maglis are super soft as well  but I just cant get past that OJ thing   I do not like Allen Edmonds or Johnston & Murphy   Their leather is hard as a rock   Needless to say I am a shoe fanatic simply because a lot of men wear a really nice suit with these Godawful ugly shoes that ruins the whole effect   Go buy some nice shoes   It doesnt matter what you wear   If the shoes are bad  you look like crap I cannot comment on the womens clothes   I do not wear them   :),?
2355422,I like this place a lot  I want to love it more  I really do but there are just some things that Ive noticed in the few times coming here  Number 1 I love the cornbread its excellent  But when it comes to ordering its really hard to  communicate between the really tall thick plexi glass of what you want  Also  I think it would be nice if you could label what we are looking at behind the glass because for the first timers its hard to tell what each little container has in it  You can only really kinda guess by glancing at the menu and then glancing back at the toppings to kind of guess what each one is  This takes up time and holds up the rest of the line from moving quickly ,?
2355502,I like this place a lot  very nice employees  good selection of films ,?
2356114,I like this place for sate beef pho and spring rolls  I like the owner  an older gentleman whos really nice  The staff are quick to get you a menu and the food comes out fast and hot  Prices are inexpensive  the portions are large (if you get a large pho)  I like the broth which is flavourful and spicy and hot enough to cook the sprouts  Generous amounts of sprouts and basil  which you can get cooked if youre worried about getting ecoli  One of the best deals in Chinatown and one of the better Vietnamese restaurants ,?
2356461,I like this place!  I wanted to give this place a few tries before I reviewed it   Ive ordered to go several times since I live so close  Ive gotten the spicy chicken thai fried rice and the screaming O salad   The fried rice was filing and spicy  and I love the salad!  They serve the dressing on the side  and I usually drench my salad in the spicy  tangy dressing  so good!  Ive also dined in a few times and tried several different rolls   The rolls are pretty filling so I go here when I have a sushi craving but dont want to do all you can eat   They dont do any Nigiri so as long as youre in the mood for either rice or rolls  this place will do   I also like that they have sweetened iced green tea!  Every time Ive come in  there isnt usually many people  the service is quick  the cashiers are always friendly  and the food is good   *Ive noticed the spicy rolls are sometimes inconsistent with spiciness though  either way  still so good!,?
2356645,I like this place  I dont love it  Ive definitely had better quality Italian food but the two times Ive been here havent been bad and the food is overall good  not great  Until I find a better Italian spot this will be my staple ,?
2356668,I like this place  I really do  I dont understand why it has to be so loud  I went for breakfast with a friend this morning and we had to repeat ourselves a number of times just to be heard  No that has nothing to do with the food  and nothing to do with the quality of the service  both were outstanding  Again like I say I really enjoy this place  but they could do with the music being about half as loud ,?
2356957,I like this place Good food and people But watch out for the lettuce  Whether it is a garnish or a part of an assembled sandwich  the lettuce is always sad  brown  and looks like the bad part of Steve Buscemis teeth ,?
2357284,I like this place  Clean and polite staff specially the pinay that have longhair  she have a charming face  I love all the food also the puto ni bibs,?
2357348,I like this place  Good pizza  Good flavor  Theres so much bland pizza out there bit this pizza is really good  The crust is baked all the way  nice!   My friend says the subs are amazing ,?
2358192,I like this restaurant a lot  It has fresh ingredients and a fresh take on the restaurant conveyor belt  usually reserved for only sushi/Japanese food  We ordered the original flavor hotpot  and the beer combo  They also have a special from 09:3012:30  Buy one get one free Happy Hour  Very Nice!,?
2358278,I like this restaurant  Strategically located on State street  this restaurant is one of our favorites  My favorite ones are lambshank  lamb couscous and/or lamb pide  Lamb Pide is my first choice  as the price and the portion are reasonable  Their fish curry is close to my native food  taste  so I feel like Im at home :)  which is always some good feeling  I love spicy food  so I can handle it well  but for those who dont like it spicy  you better ask the server to customize it   I always appreciate their service  The waiter/server is always nice  Come hungry as theyll provide you with some bread with their homemade olive oil  and some soup or salad prior to your main course  Unfortunately  Ive never gotta try their dessert  as were always having food coma from the appetizer and the main course  I would love to try their Baklava  some other time ,?
2359351,I like to make my review short and simple   Get off your computer  get in your car  turn the air conditioner on  drive down (or up ) to switch and leave the rest of the work to the fabulous chef and other great people who work there   Seriously  The lamb appetizer did this little happy dance in my mouth   My daughter and I both enjoyed different salads My daughter had TWO Sangrias  and loved them both   The waiter was tons of fun   The place was moderately busy but  the one very hysterical waiter had it under control and he let us know it   Yep  I love to switch!,?
2359543,I like to stop in here whenever I go to Boulder City   I enjoy the outdoor seating  live music and the hefeweizen ,?
2359641,I like to think Im a bubble tea expert at this point because of what an addict I am  having grown up on the West Coast  but I had never had so many choices of modifications as I did here! You can choose the level of sweetness  milk type  size  flavor  jellies  whatever your heart desires  Im a fan :),?
2359852,I like tropical smoothie  but there is no consistency! I go mostly to the one on Durango and warm springs and usually after midnight  Theres almost always a new person working  This is most likely the companys falt  Im sure it doesnt pay much and  probably run poorly Now when its done right the ultimate club and acai berry boost are one of my all time favorite combos ever! Heres what stops me from going for months at a time  They dont always toast the bun!!! Changes the sandwich completely! Second when I get a smoothie that is 3/4 of an inch from being full!This might seem petty but when they get it right its hard to enjoy it wrong! Agian I blame it on poor store management  Oh and this sample size is over the last 5yrs Ive lived on this corner  The last 2yrs being the worst!,?
2360477,I liked it over the other dealers in charlotte I went in search of a car  and I found the one of my dreams from a nice salesman  I said I had to think and go to lunch  He told me to take the car with me and drive it around  I did  and it drove beautiful  It was one that they were needing to get rid of  It was a 2017 that had two miles on it  I bought it  and have never looked back  My friends love it  and so does my family There are some minor negatives  but very minor indeed  The only problem I had was it took a little longer than I anticipated  I bought the car  and I was there for over two hours  I was ready to leave  When I left they told me the best way to get home  I loved the people  and I will be back to get my next one for sure ,?
2360852,I liked that they had a variety of noodle options to pick from  I like them thin but the flat one was delicious too  Dont get the widest option unless you like it doughy  The broth was decent  I wish they had a non spicy braised pork option  Food itself is 4 stars but the environment is 2 stars   Very tiny tight space! No place to put our huge winter coats where we were sitting ,?
2361291,I liked the food from the unique adobo nation to the spinach & artichoke dip  The artichoke dip was different in that they served it already on individual pieces of toasted bread with cheese  No dipping necessary  and I liked that and it was good  The adobo nation was a tad bit sweet  and I wish there was more pork belly and the chicken sliced more  That being said  I still liked it  Everyone was extremely friendly  except for the waitress with black hair & glasses who couldnt be bothered to say hello when we entered  Whenever I saw her  she just looked pissed  The chef was very involved with his customers by asking about the food  He was a bit too friendly when he came to our table to wish me a happy birthday  He wanted to hug me once and then again when we were leaving  planting a kiss on my cheek  Awkward! I dont even know the guy  Maybe its best the chef stays in the kitchen  The four stars are for the good food and the friendly server we had ,?
2361649,I liked the room  The customer service however was pitiful  The dealers were rude  the waitresses were rude  The valet drivers were rude  etc    Makes me want to spend my money elsewhere next time  thats for sure    No bueno,?
