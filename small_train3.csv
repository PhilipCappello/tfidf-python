Fun little place to stop and have lunch  There was plenty of parking out back  and more tables on the patio than there was inside  The lunch menu has all the basics  I chose the turkey sandwich which was very moist and tasty  I also ordered a strawberry banana smoothie which hit the spot on this hot day  This a dog friendly place that has tie outs here and there ,positive,1307144
This place was PACKED  Went for late night food  They serve late which is awesome  Ended up having to get our food to go because they had 1 cook & he got slammed w/ orders  I got pork schnitzel sandwich  The breading was dark but still good   however there was NO  potato salad on sandwich as described   Disappointing   Boyfriend ordered the spicy burger ($9) He said it was OK  He wasnt super impressed  Waffle fries were good  Prices are reasonable  Debating whether wed give them another shot ,negative,5544361
We board the plane 30 minutes before the actual flight  to make sure that we leave on time! The flight from Las Vegas to Sacramento took 1 hour and 15 minutes! Not bad at all! During our 1 hour and 15 minute flight  the servers were very kind and polite  They serve soda  oranges  water  roasted peanuts  and pretzels while you are in there  The flight is a breeze and I wasnt afraid at all! It was a nice experience and I hope to be able to go on another trip with Southwest Airlines again ,positive,5956200

I hadnt been to an Outback for a very long time   And it will be a very long time before I go back   Its okay   Just okay   And maybe thats the problem  Our server was great   My steak was good  very lean  cooked the way I asked   The sweet potato was good   My son ordered a burger piled high with crispy onions  and he enjoyed it   The server recommended a wedge salad  which I did not like   To make it unique  the chef added a balsamic dressing to it   The blue cheese and balsamic were not a happy pairing  The brown bread Outback is known for was okay  but I prefer the slightly sweet brown bread from Cheesecake Factory   The blooming onion  which we thought we liked so much in the past  has lost its luster   Too much for two people and neither of us liked the dipping sauce   These days it seems an eating experience has to be terrific from start to finish  and Outback just doesnt hit all the high points ,neutral,2170910
Really??? $18 dollar valet   I would encourage people not  to come here  What a joke  Dont waist your time or money  Pass every MGM property  You have options ,negative,4322169
This is one of my favourite Tim Hortons in Toronto  The reason? Friendly / reliable staff  I have never had a problem with my orders at this location  The place is clean  the staff are nice  the food is above par for Tim Hortons    My only complaint is the washrooms are single occupancy only so there is sometimes a lineup to use the toilet ,positive,5304619
As the name implies  this location of Mon Ami focuses on Korean BBQ with an allyoucaneat menu  Our group focused on the meats: chicken  bulgogi  pork  kalbi    and while those were cooking we dug into steamed dumplings  salmon sashimi  fried chicken  seafood pancake  and soybean paste stew  While they were all pretty good (and the fried chicken was great as in all locations)  come here for the BBQ  Get yourself some lettuce  sesame oil and salt  soybean paste  kimchi  seasoned green onions  raw garlic  and go to town with your slightly charred meats and seafood  Also  feel free to grab as many sodas or juices you want from the fridge in the middle of the restaurant  I hear that the weekend has more options than weekdays  so the extra price may be worth it if you want more variety  As it is  we still focused on the meat and Im craving it again as I type this    ,positive,359864
Tariq is topnotch! Ive known Tariq as a business contact for a few years  and Im grateful to have finally become his client  He specializes in Power of Sale properties from the investors side  My first deal was an entry level property and I still netted a cool 32K in less than 4 months  There were 22 offers on the property I ended up purchasing  and ours was the winner  Ive seen Tariq win deals where there were even 25 offers on the table  All because of his contacts and his expertise  If youre an investorclient looking to get your hands on one of those elusive hot properties  Tariq is your man! I should mention that Tariq is a onestopshop in that he has access to a number of great mortgage brokers he can put you in touch with  as well as home inspectors and contractors  Youll be lucky to have Tariq on your team ,positive,4684053

This is my go to! I remember when it first opened thinking this place will never make it as its too far off the strip and felt that there was not enough parking  Now these are the two qualities I enjoy the most  The casino atmosphere is top notch and of course if you like the hard rock you have to love the music that comes with it  Thank you for the guys at Track Results for making it possible,positive,5287357
I love Pizza!!Tonys has a great lunch special  A slice of pizza with a side salad or garlic knots and a drink for like $6 50 The pizza is great! I have been just for a slice and also for a pie with the Fam! My dad used to get the sausage and peppers and really liked it  The salad is good with the mozzarella on top of it and the Italian dressing Its perfect for a quick bite or to pick up  I do suggest if you dine in and want a pie  to order everything beforehand and then get there and enjoy it without the wait!,positive,2384190
Ordered the carry out pizza special last night and it was made fresh  hot  and delicious  It was not greasy and I thought it was perfect!,positive,4115242
I made the mistake of selecting this place to meet up with my family who were visiting from Florida   Waited at bar for 20 minutes before be able to order a drink even though there were only 3 other people at the bar  Once the bartender did decide to wait on me  he was very short What will you have? and proceeded to give me a a receipt for the amount due before I could order 6 more drinks for the rest of our party??? We eventually left that bar after no one returned to our group sitting at the bar for the following 25 minutes  We then moved onto the restaurant where we waited for 45 minutes for our entrees to arrive  Food was pretty good Moved onto gaming area where approximately 1 out of 5 games were not operating properly  This place has really gone down hill in the past 34 years  We will NOT be going back!,negative,2474304
Sunday afternoon   World cup soccer   Packed bar   And    one bartender/waiter Four of us sat down and waited for some menus   and waited   and waited    and waited    and   yep  you guessed it   waited   20 minutes went by  and we dont even have menus yet The couple sitting across from us  looked very angry as they motioned for attention but was constantly ignored Get some staffing to run your business right  fools ,negative,4640376
Best  Drunchies  Ever  Came here after a great night at XS  love how its located right next to Wynn!The lines do get pretty long  i mean  cheap delicious food after a night of dancing is a must!All their tacos are great! esp  carne asada!! Juicy and tender  I love how they cook it right then and there so you know its fresh! You can also ask for grilled veggies! Dont forget to ask for their hot sauces when youre ordering because they dont have a hot sauce bar  Their sopas are also superrr good  Would really recommend it!BTW  there are different lines for different kinds of meat  and dishes so make sure to stand in the right line!,positive,559232

Smells awesome!!!!Got some home made tamalies that were pretty good with the way I prepared them and kinda wish I got some more!I also picked up some steak pastrami and nibbled on that for a week too  it did seem a little dry and I tried to cook with it but only seemed to get drier but I am not a cold cuts kind of guy so maybe not take my word for it   Go and grab something yourself and be the judgeCheers!!!!,neutral,4469211
After going to the other Pomegranate Cafe in Ahwatukee  I had very high expectations for this location  Unfortunately I will less than impressed with my first time here  I had ordered one of the wraps which I have had before at the other location  and when I got it I noticed it was missing a ton of the ingredients that were listed in the menu  It didnt even have the ranch dressing that it was supposed to come with  For paying $14 for a wrap  I would expect a little bit more  Our service was pretty slow so I decided to just eat my meal and not say anything  I think in the future I will make the drive to the Ahwatukee location where ive never had a bad experience/meal ,negative,189895

Spectacular BYOB  dont miss it!Superb French / Mediterranean inspired delicious food that is a adventurous  approachable and good value   The place couldnt be cozier and service is always stellar   Weve been to Zinho probably 15 times and the experience is consistent  the staff is welcoming  the food is top notch  Call ahead because there can be a wait and the place is small and intimate and diners enjoy European style eating that is not rushed  so plan ahead   Dont forget your favorite bottle (or bottles) of wine and be sure to share a glass with your server ,positive,4563262

My boyfriend  his brother  and I all went to Buffalo Wild Wings  It was Thursday and when the bill came we had questions  We flagged down the server and asked him and he apparently asked his manager to speak with us  I have no issue with that normally  but when a strident woman walks up and begins yelling at us it tends to annoy me  I tried to stay out of the conversation until she yelled at me  I know not to let my anger get in the way  so once everything worked out I asked the server for her name  The second she heard we had asked she came back over  She sounded pissed and told us there was no issue and it was a misunderstanding but that if our server was wrong she would have backed us up  All in all  the food was good  but the manager  Starr  was unpleasant  combative  and rude ,negative,3667183

I tend to only eat certain items when I do Korean BBQ & really stay away from Kimchi      Let me just say     The Kimchi was so great I ate 2 servings  The beef bulgogi is off the chain & I couldnt be happier! My husband and I stopped here on Christmas Eve (today) to fuel up before battling the crazy crowds and its awesome! The staff is so sweet & check up on you at the perfect at times  They make sure you know how to perfectly cook the meats and have great suggestions when you arent quite sure what you want  They do not disappoint! I will be bringing back friends and family! We will be back!,positive,2620888
Bought 2 cupcakes here  the difference between this cupcake place and others is that you get to customize your own cupcake  1  Pick your cupcake 2  Choose your filling and/ or frosting 3  Choose a topper   I tried the classic red velvet and the frosting was really sweet  the cake itself wasnt great either  not bad  just not great   A  little on the dry side  I do like the variety of the cakes and fillings they have though  * there was a sign that said  after 7 pm cupcakes are ( dont remember if it was 50% off or buy one get one) maybe Ill just have to try another type of cake/frosting there ,negative,583765
Old Mexico has easily become a favorite restaurant! The enchiladas are absolutely amazing! The first day I went here was on Cinco De Mayo and the place was decorated so nice  I had to get a  frozen margarita  I got a small one  and it was huge  the biggest is just extremely huge lol  My margarita was very good  a little too strong  but Im a wimp when it comes to alcohol  The portions are very large! Ive gone their twice now and their is always someone to greet you nicely and seat you quickly  The service is great and prompt  everyone that works their is super friendly  Im surprised by some reviews   I think Old Mexico restaurant is awesome and a actual nice add to the crappy century three mall!,positive,4029781

Well  it seems to be a trend with this place   we came here with a client for dinner one night and we were the only table seated in the restaurant  always a bad sign!  The service was polished and professional  the atmosphere was nice and the food was good   Someone in my party ordered the watermelon salad and they loved it   All of us ordered the grilled swordfish for our entree and it was quite tasty and just the right portion   Overall the meal was of high quality  but I am concerned for the longevity of this place with so few patrons ,positive,6206970
I have been taking my cars here for years and I have always been given the best customer service along with honest assessments of what is wrong with my cars  The prices are better than what you will pay at any other shop and they do a good job every time  Steve and Kevin are personable and cool guys  I even sent my Son over there with what I thought were bad wheel bearings on both sides up front  He came back and said it was only one side and Superior fixed his car  He came back with it saying it is like night and day from how it was riding before and making all that noise  They easily could have told him it was both sides  Thats what I am talking about  They are honest brokers  Go check them out  You wont be disappointed  Thanks Guys!

The level of service they delivered was ABOVE and BEYOND  We have had such great service in the past from Daren in the service department  we decided to return and purchase a new car  We were lucky to work with such a great sales team  Our work schedule made it hard to come to the dealership  so Chase and Alex personally delivered the car to our home  they really rolled out the red carpet for us  A few days later we got a visit from a BMW Genius that showed us all cool bells and whistles  he was FANTASTIC!

We headed downstairs and finally located BLT in the far back corner of the casino  We sat right away and the wait staff assisted right away  Our waiter was nice  but seemed new you know how that goes! :PWe ordered 2 burgers  2 SPIKED shakes (I recommend the Night Rider if you like chocolate!) and since they didnt have chili cheese fries ON THE MENU  we ordered a side of chili and criss cut fries  BEST CHILI EVER! seriously  I recommend splitting a burger though cause they are VERY large!

We had a weeknight dinner at the Verandah  and it was one of our best eating experiences in Vegas for value  food quality and service  We were there for a full 6 days  and if we go back  this is one of the only places we will bother to visit again  The inside of the restaurant was fairly busy  but the patio was almost empty (February)  Heaters made the patio very comfortable  and it was so nice and quiet  which is hard to find in Vegas  The service was fast and extremely friendly with good advice and knowledge of the foods and wines  I picked a wine to have by the glass  and when I was only semi pleased with it  the waiter was quick to recommend another and was spot on in his advice from my description of what I like  The food was so fresh and well prepared  it was almost startling  Even their iced tea is really good  and made with ice tea ice cubes to avoid dilution! Talk about detail!,positive,6014807

I honestly dont know where I would be without Toan! His guidance offers potentially the perfect blend of pragmatism and emotional intelligence/awareness  I really value his gentle yet very direct approach to talking with people  and his attention to detail and sensitivity is unparalleled  Always kind  always sincere  always there for me  simply the best! Toan has helped me work through some really trying times in my life  whether it be related to something current  or something bubbling up from the past  he always guides me to a resolution that makes sense for me at that given moment  usually in addition to a longerterm goal resolution to work towards  He doesnt just guide you in the right direction  he holds you accountable too!  Every session Ive had has always left me feeling more capable and better equipped to deal with whatever is in front of me ,positive,2311476

Came in to get my regular frapp caramel with one shot the ladies were a little frustrated or irritated I felt a very odd vibe like I wasnt welcome anyways  customer  service was alright for me felt bad for the little boy who was impatiently excited to get his drink too and they keep telling him to go away nicely till they literally said the stand needs to be clear and waved their hand around like a brushing motion to get him away from there area  Poor thing! Sorry Im not coming back    poor service  Im only rating 2 cause my drink was good but the after taste of my drink tastes like attitude was made with it lol ,neutral,687532
It was awesome and unexpected that the owner Josh gave my husband and I a letter and a couple of free meals to come back and give it another shot  He said it was just an off day and in no way a representation of the restaurant  Ive been back several times and havent seen a fly since  The food has been excellent as usual and we highly recommend Miracle Mile to everyone!,positive,3226853
Love the variety and hardtofind items that are available  I went for cheese  Lots of European selections at lower prices than the norm  Saw figs and hard European breads  Cauliflower pizza dough was in the freezer  Brands are not your supermarket ones  Had a good time checking out everything  Definitely worth a visit and to treat yourself ,positive,3499931

Came in for dinner with some friends  Service was fast and was on point with drink refills and reorders  Only down side to the meal when my fajita came to me it was sizzling and looked great but I kept smelling something burning that wasnt food  And then I saw it smoke bellowing out of the cloth handle for my fajita plate  IT WAS ON FIRE! I quickly took it off poured my water in it and handed it to them  Not a bad experience just different,positive,683095

All you can eat sushi for under $25   Includes over 50 options from deepfried  to tempura  to fresh fish   They have basic crab rolls and also fancier  more exciting rolls which are filling and look great   Cuts  rolls  and basic maki   Gyoza  dessert  salads   all included   Sushi Way is your typical AYCE sushi spot that has many options but most are more or less the same ingredients   Tasty and for the price well worth it if youre looking to stuff yourself on rice and fish   I usually prefer to spend more on higher quality sushi  but Sushi Way is very solid nonetheless   They also offer a la carte if you just want some sushi east of the strip at a cheaper price   And  dont forget the awesome names of some of the rolls   Might be worth a stop in here just for the fantastic comedic menu creations ,positive,232681
Enjoyed lunch here but unfortunately the pizza was left in the oven too long and edges were burnt !  They served it anyway like that!!,neutral,986525
We loved this place  Thought it looked a bit chainy from the outside  and I realize that it is a growing regional chain  but the food and service felt more like a local place than an Olive Garden or something like that  Fantastic service (server who wasnt afraid to offer definitive recommendations when we asked about various items) who was also good with our kid  We split a couple of entrees (not pizza) that were both great  too  was just going to look up the menu to remind myself what it was  but the website appears to be down   Decor was a bit kitschy  but gave you something to do while waiting for food  is that a penguin up there? kinds of conversations  especially helpful with a kid whos hungry!,positive,6075194

Im very impressed by this place  before I give it 5 stars though  I would like to try more of their food   I had the Beghan Aloo  its potatoes and eggplant with spices   It was incredibly good  but also drenched in ghee (not necessarily a bad thing)   I also had the rasmalai  which if youve read any of my reviews of indian restaurants  is my favorite dessert EVER   It was only okay here  not quite the best ive ever had   The service was really good   Its a pretty bare bones restaurant  with a little bit of ambiance  but I dont really care much for that  the one sample dish I had here was pretty darn good  I will definitely be coming back to check out the lunch buffet ,positive,2961439
It was a decent chicken quesadilla cant say much about it since I was in the airport so it was a little high price I paid more for it than what I normally wouldve paid I probably wouldve been better off just going to a less expensive place&  getting a chicken quesadilla I also ordered a sangria which I definitely paid way too much for because it was not worth the amount of money that I paid for itI guess when youre traveling you do expect to pay more in the airport so Im not gonna complain too much but for a sit down restaurant you do expect a little bit better service because I was sitting for a while before anyone did come to serve me Thank goodness the guacamole was good because they didnt give much salsa and the chicken was a little bland so the guacamole did help in adding flavor ,negative,3223015

I am fairly new to this side of town  but since I have been coming to this Albertsons Ive have nothing but great experiences  First off  the staff is always great  no matter who you ask     Deli  floral  produce  they are all helpful and can help you out quick  The main reason for the review is for the BEER selection  its great  If you are a beer drinker and say to yourself I need to go to total wine  or lees discount for my beer selection  you no longer need to think that way because of this store   Great seasonal selection    Including Dogfish pumpkin ale  Brooklyn ale and other selections you would not think you could find at a local grocer  I have lived in the NW side of town for the last 7 years and have never been able to run to an Albertsons for a top selection of beer  Good job to whoever runs the beer  wine and spirits selection ,positive,1856942
Impeccable service  perfectly timed food  perfect knowledge of the wine list  unobtrusive table service/clearing   The best martini in Vegas   A beautiful setting  the art in the dining room is gorgeous and the bar is beautifully lit and sparkly   Great music (Sinatra and associated Rat Pack tunes of course)   And fabulous people watching   Get the Lobster Risotto  i swear there must have been the meat of a 1 lb lobster in there   And an amazing caprese with heirloom tomatoes of many colors   My favorite dinner in Vegas!,positive,3170579
Other reviewers have stated that customer service is lacking  spot on   I was at Albertsons around May 14th  I went to grab some milk and noticed that most of the sell by dates was May 5th   When checking out I told the cashier  she seemed annoyed at me for bringing up the fact that most of the milk was bad   A few days later  I stopped back by (hey its close to home) and noticed the expired milk was still there!  Yuck!  Check the produce too people  Ive gotten some bad fruit and rotten potatoes too   Everytime Im there I have never been greeted by the cashier  even when I say hello  Im  met with a blank stare   Same goes for when Im leaving  no goodbye or offer to help with my bags   thats a common courtesy most grocery stores do        So thats about it Ill stick with the Albertsons down on Decatur and Blue Diamond for now  then hopefully the new WalMart will open soon on Rainbow ,negative,4121296

I actually have a cousin named Hess   Well  his last name is Hess   Unfortunately  that really does nothing for the pain at the pump  as I have to pay just the same as anyone else   Luckily  Hess is typically a bit cheaper than almost everyone in town   I just wish they were a little closer  as I do have to go a bit out of my way to get to their place Luckily  when I get there  it is really easy to get in and get out again so that I can get going  something that is not always the case everywhere   That  and the pumps at this particular location (at least) are usually in fine operating order  so you do not find yourself standing around holding your hose for what seems like hours (looking at you here BP) All in all  a fine example of a gas station ,neutral,1824152

Went here for a friends birthday party  We had dinner on the second level in the Mezzo  where they feature more fine dining options and charcuterie  What is really nice is that you are able to have half portions of the pasta  which is still plenty for one person  I had the seafood risotto and it was great! Another thing is that with a party of 9  they were very accommodating  The only real downside was that this place doesnt take reservations  The longer wait for the food was understandable due to it being dinner time on a Friday and also the fact that there were 9 in our party  In addition  they also allowed us all to split the checks  which is rare for many establishments for large parties  Our waitress was really nice as well!I cant wait to visit the rooftop beer garden in the summer!,positive,6228751

This is where I go when I want to eat well downtown  Ive taken several people to this restaurant on various occasions and they were all delighted  I especially love their grilled cod and the toffee pudding  but in fact everything on the menu is delicious  Sunday roast is a must if you go on a Sunday  In the evening  tax and tip included  expect to pay between $30 per person if you stick to a main dish with water and $80 if you add a couple of drinks  appetizers and dessert ,positive,5361229

Of course when you visit Las Vegas you have to come here  Its in the middle of Las Vegas Blvd  south just across from the Las Vegas Harley dealership  For you older folks its across from where the Klondike Casino used to be  You used to have to run across Las Vegas Blvd to get a pic but they have a large parking lot there now  Its on South Las Vegas Blvd  you cant access on the North side  When I used to come here a million years ago youd be there by yourself  not anymore  It can get crowded  But its worth it  On the day we went we saw Elvis doing a wedding  and got our picture taken with a couple show girls  Give yourself a little time as there may be a line ,positive,3987204

I love checking out local wineries so when I was booked to officiate a wedding at Jilbert  I was thrilled!  We had a lovely ceremony outdoors and the upstairs area which can be reached through a walkway as well (no worries for handicapped folks!) is absolutely gorgeous and has a lovely rustic feel   I think they had about 75 guests   I enjoyed a few glasses of wine while I was there and went home with 4 bottles  3 of which were the Honey wine!  Yum!  The bottles and glasses were both reasonably priced too!  I have recommended it a number of times already!,positive,2391597
After reading the reviews on Yelp  we decided to try their luncheon buffet   For two adults and two kids  plus 4 sodas  our bill was close to $30   Guess when I read the review for the buffet pricing  it seemed to be cheaper The food was pretty good and the selection was ok   They seemed to be cooking 1/2 pizzas to keep the selections fresh and hot   The fried chicken was really good  and I couldve just eaten that and the pizza sandwich they offered  but did not refill since we came in during the last 1/2 hour of the buffet Overall  would go again if in the area  but not drive specifically for the buffet ,neutral,203275

I used to come here as a child  Back before the invasion of the other types of restaurants on the block  and before the rent went up tenfold  And of course  before the new  somewhat unfortunate name  2000  It reminds me of those ancient hotmail accounts and Geocities usernames  Anyway  it used to be called Haandi  After a very long gap in my life  I decided to give Haandi an option to return  and came here for a lunch buffet  The restaurant itself is very dated  as most restaurants in Little India are  However  the food itself is quite delicious  Haandi does tandoori chicken really well  along with many of their vegetarian dishes  I find myself avoiding this place lately as it makes me break the second cardinal sin  However  the friends I had with me were also raving about it afterwards  That always feels great  Youre welcome ,neutral,2663995
The food here was terrible!!! I ordered garlic shrimp with white rice to go  First of allIt took them 30 minutes to make food that tasted terrible  The shrimp literally had diced garlic  on it and it tasted like it was straight from a freezer and they just microwaved it  I paid over 12 dollars for the shrimp or it might have been 14 dollars and it was not even deveined  The food was very bland  Just not worth the time or the money  Maybe everyone on here has a different experience than I did but I would never ever order from here again  Just merely disappointing  The people there were nice but the food was just nasty  Sorry guys :(,negative,4850541

I would give them a minus one if I could  I scheduled an appointment to be seen for a sinus infection and drainage in my ear canals  I informed  Dr  Chiara of my symptoms  which had been going on for a couple of months  and he told me I had severe hearing loss  He prescribed me an antibiotic  which created severe GI distress and scheduled me to meet with the audiologist for hearing aids without ever examining my ear s to determine if I need hearing aids  I am now looking for a new and better ENT  Dont waste your time  this place is laughable!!!,negative,2864916
Fresh  fresh  fresh!

Went last night and it was great  The calamari was delicious  I then decided to order off the restaurant week menu  The shrimp was good  the penne all vodka was amazing  the chicken parm was good (needed more sauce for the chicken but overall good flavor) and the panna cotta for dessert was delicious  The people I was with really enjoyed their meals too Throughout our meal multiple workers would offer us water or more bread  Very attentive staff Our waitress was Raven  Even if our food wasnt good I would go back just for her  She was delightful throughout our entire dining experience ,positive,6256678
What a great place this is! The mixologist encouraged me to try the portobello burger and it was to die for!

This place is mediocre at best  I realize when talking pizza  not everyone has the same likes and preferences The crust wasnt my favorite  very thick  but not awful  The sauce gave me heartburn so that wasnt fun  but my least favorite part of the pizza was the oh so important cheese  I really wasnt expecting such low quality cheese  I mean for the price I was under the impression the pizza here was a step above pizza hut but really Id rather just buy $5 pizza at Little Caesars  The wings were good  nice flavor and cooked just right Customer service was decent  I like the location of this pizza joint  definitely very hole in the wall and loud but not too loud  I doubt Ill buy pizza here again  but maybe wings ,neutral,5489701

I tried Indie Coffee for the first time today  I ordered their Ghirardelli Mocha and their Red and White Waffle  The mocha is the best mocha Ive ever had and the homemade whipped cream on top is perfectly light and fluffy  The Red and White Waffle has strawberries with their housemade whipped cream! I got a side of their Ghirardelli Chocolate Sauce to pour over my waffle and it was great  The balance of the soft buttermilk waffle with the tart strawberries and the rich chocolate was an awesome decision  I will most definitely come back here again to try other items on the menu  I would highly recommend Indie Coffee for locals who have not been here and for new people in town  Its a great place to have in Madison  There is WiFi too if youre looking for a place to do work on a laptop  The downside to this place is that it seems packed all the time but you can always ask to share a seat with a stranger ,positive,2648018
Great food very light and flavorful it was a colorful meal!We came around 5:00pm and there was zero wait although it was a Monday so I suggest making a reservation if your planning on eating here during the weekend  The atmosphere felt like you were eating right on the side of the river I suggest asking for a table near the water feature  You felt very isolated and quaint although your right in the middle of the rush of people  The service was great and the staff was very helpful and kind  I recommend eating here if your looking for a casual amazing place to eat!!!,positive,1476619

Queso arrived lukewarm  It was solid due to not being hot enough  My food arrived cold  The server had it removed from the bill but one would think a manager would have come over to apologize  The atmosphere was nice  lots of draft beers and tons of tvs but now I understand why this place was not even at half capacity on a Saturday at 6pm ,negative,4273733
I really like this bar Its nothing fancy  theres no kitchen  and the crowd isnt the prettiest to look at   But the bartenders seem to genuinely care about customers  the owner seems like a really nice guy who goes out of his way to get to know his patrons  and the beer is always cold   The prices are good for what youre getting  and the regulars are all very friendly If youre in Surprise and youre looking for a place to have a few beers and watch some television  this is probably where you should go ,neutral,2549499
I am so pleased to have discovered The Meat Market!

Everything is pretty mediocre here but thats exactly what I expected out of the buffets even in Vegas  They used to have caviar and freshly shucked oysters on the spot but they dont even have those anymore and the quality of the food seemed to have gone down hill from the last time we visited  I ended up just enjoying plates and plates full of steamed crabs  The line was not too long so that was good and if you check in  you get to go to the VIP line which is much shorter  Make sure everyone checks in to get everyone in your party in the VIP line  I think their dessert was pretty good compared to other buffets I have been to in Vegas though  The service was actually a surprise was the server was very attentive and brought out new drinks even when we didnt even ask and took our plates away every time we finished a plate so it wouldnt stack up on our table ,neutral,1016398

Love the retro sauce  NOT for the healthnut Poutine ahh fries are thick and crispy  and not over salted  (Sometime somewhat bland is why it loses a star)Gravy  yum  My fav is the crispy chicken poutine :) works on own as meal or side for the hungry Fish and chips went beyond my expectations! The batter is soo tasty and crisp  and a generous serving too! Hooked since my first trip last year!,positive,355591

Came here on one of the preopening nights and the food was fabulous with great service   Fun vibe  high energy and a great addition to Tempe  Started with antipasti; then we had the rainbow trout and Korean style ribeye cap  Very limited availability so ask for it asap   Dessert was the bourbon black bottom pie  Yum  yum! We enjoyed plenty of wine and scotch drinks ,positive,668092
This was the second time I stayed here   The experience on my first trips was good  This time it was even better    They are renovating which is good to see   The staff there is helpful and the rooms are clean and spacious   They offer a Good amount of eateries to choose from and ha e some outstanding shows    I would recommend staying here   They are renovating  have a lot of restaurants  indoor walk to Mandalay Bay and is conveniently located near I15 and the malls/outlets ,positive,5655657
Although extremely busy (esp during The Christmas Market)  service was fast and friendly but my complaint is with the food  Tried to order schnitzel since its the Wednesday special but by 8:30pm they had ran out  Ordered the perogies and wild boar bratwurst between 2 people; and the portions were SO SMALL  For being $14 each  I was hoping it would at least be a substantial amount that people werent still extremely hungry afterwards  I wont come back to eat here  unless they up their portion sizes  5 stars for the Weizenbock though!,negative,240015
This place was located right outside not too far from Marquee  We were all pretty tired after the club and wanted to eat something savory  Ive heard of this place from so many others and have always wanted to try it for myself! The servers and cashiers were very nice and quick to take our orders  Our food arrived in less than 5 minutes after ordering  I got the cheeseburger and dont regret it one bit! Theres something amazing about adding egg to your meal  especially in a burger  The burger wasnt too big considering the price  so I suggest adding another item or getting an appetizer to go along with it  Would definitely eat here again  perhaps at a location thats closer to me than LV ,positive,5556390
Great experience this time around   I started off with a latte   I asked for almond milk but unfortunately they didnt have any that day   Sad :(  Very good latte   The boy got a mocha and of course he was happy   Sweet seeker!  I ordered a ham and brie omelet with a side of Lyonnaise potatoes   Yum diggity   The boy had the Croque Monsieur with salmon and an egg and potatoes   He dug it   Service is a little slow on a Sunday morning   Get there before 11am or it will be packed ,positive,1457678

Terrible service  Weve been using Aaron pools for several months and our pool is infested with Algae and is super filthy  Went out to check the chlorine tablets and it was completely empty  I thought the point of having a pool cleaning service was to actually clean your pool  We tried to call them to fix this and they just kept skipping appointments and brushed us off  Called a new company and they were out the same day and we now have a clean pool!,negative,4700750
Terrible service  Tried this place twice and doesnt seem like it will be getting better  I work here at town square and thought I would try this place for lunch but very rare do they ever answer the phone and when they do they place u on hold for about 10 minutes  I walked over to order in person and its dead so dont know why I was on hold for so long  And when I came the other night with some friends we were ordering food and drinks and after every drink and food order the waitress kept bringing the check and kept trying to get us to leave! I mean there was about 6 of us we wanted to spend money! Oh well their loss  I dont recommend this place and at this rate I expect them to go out of business soon ,negative,4700567
Man so many bads with this place  Their rice was old when we had their sushi  The fried sushi roll wasnt even sushi anymore  The rice was gelatinized into a dense block of who knows what meaning they reuse food from days ago  Their pad thai and fried rice was soggy  Everything is bland  The servers are pissed off and threw our food onto the table  One of them had plating issues where she just put everything at the edge of the table even though the middle of the table was empty  Theyre bored and angry!It was 5pm on a Saturday and the restuarant only had 4 tables filled  Over priced  Its mainly a convenient location for tourists to try out  Dont go ,negative,3575511

My friend cant recommend Verona Service any more highly  Always tells you exactly what is wrong with your vehicle  cost of parts  cost of labor  and asks you how you want to proceed  Keeping my friends 2001 Pontiac Grand Am alive and well now that it is no longer leaking oil! :)Shamelessly plagarized off said friends facebook page ,positive,3733934
5 star atmosphere  3 star food  4 star drinking makes this a 4 star overall experience I went here with a large group of colleagues for dinner and drinks   We ordered almost one of everything on the menu   My favorite  by far  was the Drunken Chicken   Everything else was soso for my taste  although everyone else seemed to enjoy the food The bar area was nice  normal selection of top shelf liquors that one expects in Vegas  bartenders were quick and poured stiffly   And after you pound down a few cocktails  head off to the bathroom for a real treat:  Some of the coolest bathrooms that I have ever seen   I dont want to ruin the surprise  just go ,positive,59698
I need to say that I am extremely disappointed with my experience because I feel like I got ripped off  And I am not a cheap guy  I will pay for value any day of the week  So Two of us ordered the $50 platter  The sashimi was average and light on quantity   I had to order two more over priced dishes and desert   I paid $135 before tip for fish   rice  and a couple drinks  The way I see it there are 50 other places in the city you can dine at and get the same experience for half the price  One thing I will say is that the service was nice and attentive  met my expectations  But regardless even If the price was right I would still give it 3 stars  there is nothing overly unique about this place   ,negative,2485956
Just found this gem   This is a great place for every ice cream lover   Great place to hang out with friends or to go on a date I recommend the sundaes at this place   This is pure 50s and 60s style that isnt forced   Staff are very friendly and patient ,positive,3329183
My boyfriend and I tried the carnitas  chorizo  shrimp  and mahi mahi tacos  I didnt love or hate any of them  I liked the chorizo taco  but it wasnt anything special  We also got guac and chips on the side  Their guac tasted identical to Chipotles guac  which means it was delicious  We really wondered if it actually was from Chipotle because it tasted way too similar to it  Loved the chips that the guac came with  They provided basically a whole bag of chips and a plastic container of the guac  Taste | 3 5Atmosphere | 3Presentation | 3Service | 3OVERALL | 3 5,positive,3662548

Iron Chef America  not Iron Chef International So I heard that Todd English was an Iron Chef for Iron Chef America  I was excited to see what kind of food his restaurant Olives could present  I must say that the decor isnt too bad as the seats are comfortable and the olive theme really stood out  However  when the food display after arriving looked less than average and its taste was exactly how it looked  I cant help but to give this restaurant only 3 stars because it doesnt live up to its standards of what an Iron Chef restaurant should taste like  If this was Iron Chef food  the show better watch out because I can be the next Iron Chef America ,neutral,3197751
Yelp eventamazing time a very happy Yelper The appetizers here are amazing  I mean I couldnt put down the twisted bread knots and sausage bites   The pizza was abundant and tasteful coming from a coal/log oven   The staff was amazing and attentive to their guests   But what a night   They give great doggie bags and presentation is a huge thing for this restaurant   You would never expect this type of establishment in the mall  but oh will I be back   Its hidden by Dillards but its anything but shy   The flavors are good and the toppings are large  which I love  My favorite had balsamic sauce on the pizza with portebello mushrooms and sausage   I would definitely come back to this establishment  for their pizza oven  good bites  great atmosphere and attentive staff   This is a very relaxed place that youll be able to satisfy your pizza and BREAD craving!!,positive,6501844

They should change the name to just Beer   The burgers were a disappointment   First  a $15  6 oz  burger better be fantastic  but it wasnt   Second  I ordered the burger with BBQ sauce (a 50 cent upcharge) and  it looked like they put it on with an eye dropper   I couldnt even taste it   The service was much like what others have described   The server was attentive enough but his attitude was such that I wished he hadnt been Go to Lagasses Stadium if you are at the Venetian/Palazzo  Not the greatest burger in the world but next to this place  it is a huge step up ,negative,5138099
Very unprofessional! I will not go there ever again  and do not recommend this place to anyone  Front desk guy was rude on the phone and in person  I just needed highlights  the guy bottled my roots instead (he insisted!)  The young girl proceeded to bottle dye my blond hair  it turned out horrible (very brassy)  The students there seemed lazy and were sitting in the salon area talking (not good salon etiquette)  It seemed more of a place for ethnic hair  but even ladies with ethnic hair were complaining  I went one time  because I needed something quick and it was the only place in the whole city with time  I have went to many schools when I cant find a last minute appointment  BIG MISTAKE going to this school  Products are off brand  which is a huge NO NO! Go somewhere else   ,negative,5862598

Love the decor and vibe here  its fun  energetic and best of all  with around 60 beers on tap  I would however  say that most of their craft beers are really toeing the line between craft and big brew (seeing that they have Creemore on the list) Came here with a craft beer aficionado and neither he nor I were impressed with the selection  We did not like the fact that the beer flights here are fixed (meaning you cannot choose outside of preselected beers)  and we thought the flights were pricey at $12 We did enjoyed the burgers that we ordered  We thought the fries that came with the burger were a bit stingy on the portion size  but otherwise quite tasty and well prepared Overall  its basically AOK for me    3 stars for the food and decor  2 stars for their beer selection ,neutral,3491051

This is my first time visiting this location on Eastern Ave  and I can honestly say that I will never intentionally be a repeat customer The place was pretty much dead  so you would think you would receive decent service   Well I was wrong!  I believe our waitress had a name tag that said Tammy though I might be mistaken Here is a pointer Tammy   When you see the table needs refills on their drinks and you say that you will be right back with them   You dont return with only 2/3 of the drinks which were for the teenagers and make the adult who is paying the bill wait 15 minutes before coming back to the table and offering to return with a refill the next time you come by   This is poor customer service and the reason you will be receiving the minuscule tip that I left   You might as well turn in your uniform as go work at McDonalds with the customer skills youre putting out there ,negative,5284881
It was Sunday afternoon when all of a sudden all the drains in the house began oozing up sewage  I was worried that I wouldnt be able to get anyone to come out and fix it on Sunday and half the day had already passed  I called up Pure Plumbing and everyone I spoke with was great  I was told that someone would be able to come out between 6 and 8pm and that they would try to get someone out to my house even earlier  Sure enough at 4:50pm I received a text saying that a technician was on the way  At 5:15pm  David and Michael showed up  quickly identified the problem and fixed it  They were done in less than 30 minutes and stayed to make sure everything was working properly again  I am very impressed with the service that I received! And the price was very reasonable ,positive,3222125
Really fresh and great food  Service  Is 5 stars  The only reason I didnt give it a 5 star in Yelp was because of the limited liquor menu  I think the should up there game on the cocktail list  Then its a 5  The salmon smoke jerkin wasnt that good  But everything else was great  The oysters where 5 star  Amazing  Will go back again ,positive,4301308
I love this show! From the amazing acrobatics to the Taiko drummers hanging off of the ceiling this show was amazing  I loved the drum set and was so sad it wasnt on the cd I had to get the live cd for it I dont know if hes still there anymore  but I absolutely hated the clown running around preshow stealing popcorn and emptying it onto random people  He even stole a hand full of mine  Lucky he didnt eat it all or I would have beaten him to a pulp  Nothing stands between me and my popcorn! My program even had a strangely amusing disclaimer for him as being allowed to carry on his crass antics because he had gotten a hold of certain secret Cirque du Soleil documents  Yeah    Not so amusing if he puts popcorn grease stains on your $500 dress Still  I dont let the stupid clown bring the shows rating below 5 stars  Great Show!,positive,2459164
Came here a few minutes past lunchtime and didnt get to try their Poke bowls  I was a bit bummed because I wanted to try a poke bowl with zucchini noodles  Oh well  Well have to come back  Moving on  we ordered from the dinner menu and got a little bit of everything from shrimp  to their soft shell crab  to their chicken wings  The shrimp was really good and the sauce was amazing too  I believe we got the mix of all the sauces  Cant remember what its called  Im personally not a fan of soft shell crab  but my husband enjoyed it  I felt that there was too much of the mushy stuff inside  The guts? Chicken wings were huge and the sauce was good too  I love that they serve their dishes with Cajun fries  Im a sucker for those  I ordered some rice noodles and didnt know what to expect  but they came plain  That was perfectly fine though  because we had so much sauce from the shrimp to eat it with  Service was friendly and efficient  Cant wait to go back for lunch!,positive,639858

I had never been to Cosmopawlitan to have my dog  Teddy  groomed before  When I dropped him off  I let the groomer know exactly what I wanted for my Yorkie  I told her to use the 3/4 inch clippers but leave only his paws fluffy and his head fluffily  When I went to pick him up  I have never been so mortified in my life  Not only did the groomer not come out from the back to drop him off  the receptionist went to grab him (now I know why) but his head is ODDLY SHAPED  small  and the fur on his WHOLE LEGS is still longer than my index finger  (oh  but his paws are completely shaved ) He STILL HAD SOAP ON HIM  His body hair definitely is not 3/4 inch  And his face is shaved down so small its unbearable to see this haircut on him  Although they offered to have us talk to the groomer and see if she can touch it up  I decided it best not to have her touch his hair again ,negative,2144353
We enjoyed it  at there around 2 am on Sat night (Ok  Sun am) and it was pretty good!

First time visiting   the shop itself was nice  clean  very spa like  The staff was nice  I didnt have to wait long and i like the fact that they give you a price book so you didnt have to guess how much you would end up paying  But my polish job was not so great  They didnt put enough coats on so both my toes and nails have see thru spots  Also  I would assume nail shops keep up with the current nail trends  I asked for the oval round shape and the guy who did mine acted like he had never heard such a thing  needless to say   they came out a bit uneven  For one basic mani  one deluxe mani  and one full set with gel coat for protection  I paid $90  I most likely will not be visiting again ,neutral,1177664
I gotta update this review  I love this place  I really do  Their food is great  Service is passable (but theyre a little tight with soda refills)  But they are constantly changing their hours  They used to be open for lunch on the weekends  Now theyre not  They close on weird days  Ive walked up thinking theyd be open  adn theyre not  They run the place like its a hobby or an intrusion rather than trying to run it like a proper restaurant  It gets annoying With a new Greek place opening soon in Westport  theres a good chance I might not go back to Atlantis ,neutral,2097632
Good sushi but somewhat staggered meal at Mizuya  Meal started with an exquisite toro  sashimi appetizer  Some of the best fatty tuna Ive ever had  I was dining with three collegues   They I ordered Braised short ribs and pan seared salmon  I ordered unagi and spicy tuna rolls  Theyre meals arrived  Mine was delayed about 15 mins which seemed just like very poor kitchen management coordination with the sushi chef  Hence their was the awkward no you go ahead discussion back and forth  By the time my sushi arrived  their Meals were cold  Again awkward  For such an expensive meal  I would expect the basics to be covered,negative,1383338
The buffet was a huge disappointment  Many things were inedible  The chicken was too dry and the pasta too soggy  The only redeeming point is the seafood  The giant shrimp and king crab legs were phenomenal  The best thing to do is go in during lunch time when it is cheaper (paid around $20) and just stay till dinner when the better things come out ,negative,4798589
Had my haircut there by Naomi  I had super long hair and wanted it layered  She prefers to dry cut which was a nightmare  When she was done I had a slightly layered front with a blunt cut straight across my back  While it looks ok from the front the rear view was absurd  I called back for a recut and it was worse than the first cut  She is a sweet person and a terrible haircutter  What was even funnier I had another appointment booked for the future that no one bothered to follow up on  So there you have it  The salon itself is super cool and  I would love to go back there  however  I will not  Poor customer service and a bad match up with clients and haircutters ,negative,1658152

Me and my hubby have been coming to this restaurant for years and every time we bring a different set of friends who in turn  become loyal clients  thats how good this place is!Our favourite appetizers are the calamari and the mussels; theres nothing better than soaking the sauce on the warm pita bread and clean the plate with it afterwards  For main dishes we recommend the Merguese Sausage and the Couscous Royale  both dishes full with flavour and aroma  Be prepared for a long wait as the chef/owner prepares all dishes from scratch  But rather than being put off by this  you can pass the time chatting and savouring their mint tea (an experience in itself) and if sitting at the patio  enjoying the decor that transports you to Tunisia :),positive,3596131
Kym Booke is THE MOST PROFESSIONAL realtor I have ever experienced  She dealt with our difficult HOA and made them do their job and provide necessary documents  she dealt with a less than honest title company  and dealt with a very inexperienced  or dishonest  buyers realtor  She made this transaction go as smoothly as it could possibly go with as little undue stress to us as possible  If you want a realtor who will do the job they are contracted to do  and go out of their way to make sure others do their job  call Kym  I highly recommend her!,positive,3378992
I stayed here for Memorial Day weekend  and I must say I didnt quite enjoy the atmosphere MGM offers   The room was small  had 1 window behind the bed (weird) and there is literally 0 view of Vegas   The room does not have a mini bar  and room service does not offer water (!!?)  you will have to go downstairs to buy it from the convenience store (not convenient at all)   I think the room was in the west wing so it takes about 10 minutes to walk from lobby to the elevator  overall just wasnt a smooth stay The pool area was okay  a lot of drunk parties so if you want to relax and enjoy a quiet space this isnt the place to be   Casino seems to be okay  I played a bit of poker here but they dont have a dedicated poker room  just an area separated by belt barriers; I guess you will have some perks playing poker as its right next to the emergency exit We went to Hakkasan club and that was a fun experience  crowded because of the 3day weekend but it was a blast ,negative,2604844

I finally returned to daily dose because a friend wanted to try them out  and  I must say  they were better this time  I had the breakfast burger  which was actually pretty legit     It was covered in some kind of magical cheese sauce that made it oh so tasty  I had their hash as my side      Didnt love it so much  The husband had the biscuits and gravy and didnt care for that either  I think the food here may be very hot and miss  with some items being really great and others falling flat  which is rough when their price point isnt so cheap  Regardless  I was glad we gave them another try ,neutral,2055638

They do monthly and sometimes bimonthly service at my commercial building  depends on climate and the time of the year     I dont even have to schedule it as they check the building intermittently on their own schedule and do the service in their own professional discretion   Ive never had to worry about weed growth and the rates are very reasonable  They have won my trust 100%   Highly recommended for any commercial landlord or for residential maintenance ,positive,5116276

SWA is great overall  How they can stay calm and polite dealing day in day out with all these people is admirable for sure  One thing Im noticing more and more of is the pre board numbers are going way up  It used to be more legitimate I think  Now it looks like anyone who wants a better seat can claim preboard  Case in point  saw a man at the hotel we were staying at walking around  swimming  walking a lot and now hes at the airport in a wheelchair waiting to pre  board  SWA  please start cracking down on this as you have done with the emotional support animals  Its getting bad ,positive,4367771
Must say first that our food still has not arrived  so I cant review the actual food yet   But  I cannot make this up   We ordered delivery over an hour ago and the lady was so nice taking our order   She called about 1 hour after ordering to tell apologize that her driver took the food out and fell asleep   I said that I have never heard of such a thing  what do you mean?  She said he works a night job and yeah he fell asleep   If I wanted the food still  she could have it delivered though she said   She is remaking it and said she would personally deliver it    crazy ,negative,3642117
I do have to say  I would probably of never gone there if it was not for someone else  I did go there however and the food is very good  service was poor  atmosphere good  Worth checking out  but improvement on their service is needed ,neutral,2007615
I was a fool for not coming here sooner  But I will learn from my mistake  I had the Curly Wolf sandwich  excellent  The sauce was a great mix of tangy and spicy  Next time  Ill wear my eating pants and try more ,positive,2703310
Im not a food critic    just a guy that likes to eat new/good food at a fun place  The food was delicious and it was a fun experience  Service was a little slow but nothing to complain about  Came here for lunch on a weekday and it wasnt crowed but busy enough to do some people watching  We sat out on the patio because it was nice out  They have a solid lunch menu with creative entrees  meats and cheeses  and unique sandwiches and salads  We ordered the humus appetizer and it was really good  It had halved cherry tomatoes and big chunks of artichoke heart and kalamata olives  I ordered the beef short rib stew (with green chile  white beans  and a fried egg on top) and it came with cornbread  I loved it  My lady ordered a salmon salad and liked it a lot  I ordered some of their house cocktails too and they were pretty good  I had the candlestick maker and the old fashioned  I was a little surprised the bill was $75 for lunch  but hey    it was worth it ,positive,2931369
Own multiple restaurants in town and called these guys after our internet/system crashed  Showed up in 30 min!!!

The headache the next morning is worth it   Went to Papago for the first time for a friends birthday happy hour  I never would have thought you could find such a fun brewery in a strip mall  Ill be the first to admit Im not a great beer drinker  I am the type to stick with a Miller Lite or whatever everyone else is drinking  At Papago  their selection is incredible  Its just big enough that you realize that you should order something fun  but not so large that you are overwhelmed and give up and just guess at what to order The staff is really knowledgeable  patient and are really attentive  The Orange Blossom is crazy delicious  and they have a coffee stout beer that caught me by surprise  in a good way The food is great  the menu consists of great apps  pizza  sandwiches  and the salads are fantastic  Great for an afternoon  Happy Hour or dinner  You gotta try it!,positive,4904264

This place needs to be  discovered because  its that good  Most people  from Mississauga  drive by this place and dont even realize  where it  is  But I did  As soon as we walked we were greated by the owner I think  and he asked us if it are first time there we said yes and he  showed us to are table   Then gave as a tour of the buffet  even explaining how to eat some items   The buffet  has meat dishes  and vegan  Of coarse  I had both   I had some curry goat see pictures  at it was great  I dont think  Ive had better   Also had some lamb  also great  The butter chicken  I would have to give it a 2 5 out 5  tasted like left overs but it could be me  Cheap low fair price  I think it wat $17 00 per  Place is small but very clean  Oh ya the bread forgot  whats  it call was the beat Ive ever had  ,positive,5531265
I think Ive found my regular brunch spot  Great portions  amazing food and drinks   the only bummer is there can sometimes be a wait so you may want to get their early   I recommend the strawberries and chocolate pancakes or the Cream Brulee Waffles and dont forget the Bloody Marys!,positive,2623152

Just stayed here for two nights  and the room was pretty good but when checking out they wouldnt honor a voucher for the stay they had issued and accepted when I had checked in  Honestly  I still cant believe it  Beware if you stay here and have a deal they might try and pull the old bait and switch on you too  Very shady and I had expected better of Harrahs  They could not have sent a stronger message that they do not value their customers ,negative,3352144
Didnt live up to the hype  Slow service  Long wait  Nothing we got tasted great  Bathrooms were disgusting  Host was also a waiter so that really slowed things down,negative,882223
Checked out the indoor park yesterday with Bijou !

This is a must if you like East coast NYC style thin crust giant pizza slices  I ordered a plain cheese  plus a half n half hawaii (kids idea not mine)  Americano which is meat/veggies  First off I had no idea how truly huge a 20 pizza really is  Two adults four kids two pizzas we easily fed everybody with tons left over  Sauce excellent  enough sauce too not skimpy like some places  plenty of cheese and the crust is done in some kind of brick / masonry oven because it had a very nice  very slight char some places which we like  Well be back no doubt about it ,positive,5226684
Flower Child  excellent fresh healthy alternative to most of the Vegas eateries!  It makes eating healthy  so much more fun!  Mother Earth bowl and a kombucha on tap!!!! Thanks Flower Child!!,positive,1192666
Most churches are boring This church is not  Its huge  not one square inch of this place is plain  everything is ornate and over the top  The air is very still inside  which makes it feel more epic The wait was only 15 minutes on a Saturday afternoon  Totally worth seeing at least once ,positive,3632176
Had this last night and it was delicious! I got the Chicken bowl  at first glance I didnt think it was enough food  but half way through I was getting full  The chicken was great  tender and juicy  Rice and salad were also great  The bowls also come with pitas but no hummus  Only downside! Ill have to remember order the plate next time  My friend had the Shrimp bowl  she was very satisfied  the shrimp looked great  Also I used Postmates and it was in my hands rather quickly!,positive,1672609

I wasnt sure what to expect from La Creperie  but was pleasantly surprised   I dont normally likes crepes  but my wife and her sister were insisting we try this place   We ordered the Forestiere  (Sauteed spinach  Mushrooms  cheese and topped with Bechamel) and Fruits De Mer (Seafood crepe) along with 2 savory crepes (dont recall the names  but it was one with berries and such in it) We enjoyed this meal quite a bit and the price was nice for the location its at and the quality of the food   We were stuffed  and payed a fraction of the cost and had a fraction of the wait than those who were waiting for the buffet just across the way ,positive,2786200
Store is huge with interesting selection    it was past closing time and one of the guys named Mike went out of his way to unscrew some hairpin legs off a table for me  I could tell it had been a long day for him and figured he was probably hungry and tired   in spite of all that  he was very pleasant while helping me out  I offered him a tip but he refused  Really friendly service  I would recommend Zinnias to a friend ,positive,4622141
Finito!I was here six years ago when it was bumpin and then again last weekend   What a different story   They need to close it up and redo something then reopen   I was here on a Friday at 1:00 AM so I really dont think I missed the crowd   There just wasnt one   And it was just a couple of douchebags   Six years is an eternity in the club world so not really their fault  but you can EASILY find better newer hotter clubs in Vegas ,negative,1124620
Its a clean Target and its close to home (not sure if thats a good thing)  They have it all   groceries  pizza hut  pharmacy  Starbucks  & photo dept (online orders too) They have a big parking lot and a bunch of new stores in the same area that will be opening up soon  Its a NICE TARGET   nuff said ,positive,3284518

I was dying to checkout Lago after having such an amazing experience at his other restaurant in the Aria   I met a coworker for lunch on Wednesday and we shared the salmon salad with candied walnuts  the proscuitto and fig pizza and the spanish ham and burrata with diced tomatoes  everything was fresh  flavorful and so ridiculously delicious!  We were seated at the window overlooking the fountains and Paris   perfection!  Great food  atmosphere  views and service  a winning combination!,positive,2715485
I had 3 children enrolled in Challenger from preschool 2nd grade  Hands down    This is the BEST education you can give your children   Challengers expectations are very high and it was particularly difficult for my oldest child  but she learned at a very early age how to study and focus in class   Some parents have claimed that the teachers are unloving    I saw just the opposite   They are compassionate and give praise when it is earned   All of the teachers my children had gave 110% to make sure they were achieving their full potential  My children moved out of state  otherwise they would still be at Challenger   While it wasnt easy financial  on us it was worth every penny! Recently my children  were in town visiting and we drove by the school   There was a collective we miss challenger from them   Clearly I wasnt the only one who wished they were still there!,positive,2101988
The food was awsome the service was slow our servers was great until they sat him a party 12 and waited it on it alone shame on management that table all had bottled water and 3 different bottles wine and appetizers  we were then ignored and forgot about  the fod was awsome the  flat iron was great  the the chicken was 2 huge breast  all food was seasoned and the sauses amazing our server forgot us and our little 30  to 40 dollar tip he forgot about  he was going for the 400 tip  hope he got it he did not get much from me  dinner for 2 will run u 200 but it is worth it,positive,4875147

Fast  friendly  attentive service  The food was excellent   I ordered the black bean burger; a really good one is hard to find  With bean sprouts and avocado to lighten and moisten the patty  this burger was among my favorites   Partnered with the right beverage (the bush wacker being my recommendation)  this was the perfect meal!,positive,1104912
Wow! Talk about customer service!

3 5 stars   **Great value for the $$ during Happy Hour**First visit to Primebar for HH  and I have to say that their HH has some of the great deals! Especially for the $5 appetizers  which was 50% off from the regular menu  good portion and delicious! Four of us sampled out the mini burgers  BBQ chicken flat bread  steak quesadilla  and the calamari  I especially like the flat bread and the quesadilla  so good!!! However  didnt really like the calamari as it was arrived kinda cold and the outside breading was kinda soggy  The pitfall  music was too loud  I mean  it was really loud that I had to scream to my friends although we were like 3ft away   ,neutral,50298
Had a water leak coming from my childs bathroom into the garage ceiling  When contacting Steve to set up an appointment he was very informational and provided me with the most common occurrence for my issue  Based on that conversation alone I came upstairs and was able to see the potential issue  Steve came out the next day and formally determined the cause of the leak which was the bathtub overflow  and his initial speculation  Getting access to repair the issue was another story as well as finding the right part  In the end  Steve and his counterpart were able to resolve the issue and provided me with additional information at a reasonable price  I will definitely use Plumbing King for my future plumbing issues!,positive,1641935
We were referred to David at Singer Tax and Accounting by a respected business associate well over 10 years ago and have been going to him ever since   We have been more that satisfied with the services weve received   So much so  that we have referred numerous people to them over the years   To say that our is a complex tax situation would be an understatement at best   With multiple business entities and investment types  Davids knowledge  advise and recommendations have been invaluable   We would highly recommend Singer Tax and Accounting to anyone looking for topnotch service ,positive,6169720

Peoria Nissan has been the home dealership for 3 of the Nissan purchases in my family  We have been very fortunate to have great sales people to make the car buying experience less painful  and most importantly  amazing service from their service department  I usually light heartedly tell people I buy Nissan there because of the excellent service department  That is hands down the very reason aside from the fact that they make good quality vehicles  I have one service advisor  Dusty who is just an amazing guy  His service is spectacular  he knows my car needs  always exceeds my expectations  and when things need repair  hes great at helping me to decide which are priority so its not such a pain to my wallet  Dusty never pressures me to do things that isnt necessary  and hes amazing at being able to get me a great deal when he can  I will never take my car anywhere but Nissan because I know Dusty will always get the job done ,positive,4185534

This is the place for a quick filling breakfast  Its been years since we ordered anything other than the Mexican Skillet  Its just coffee shop food  but its so good and filling  and the prices for what you get cant be beat  I wish it were closer  but even if you just go to have a nice breakfast and hop over to Trader Joes  its well worth it ,positive,5349444
Went there looking for a suitcase of all things as I saw a commercial for the type I was looking for   I did find what I wanted  the store staff was very friendly and the store was clean and a pleasure to shop in This is a great place to find some good deals   Sometimes they are hit and miss but for the most part it is a great store to shop in ,neutral,6267320
I have been here several times if usually hit or mess in fact the very first time I came in here with in 2010 I believe and I met one of my very best friends here and I remember another time that I came the security wouldnt allow Owen Wilson inside because he didnt have the right shoes he was wearing tennis shoes it was hilariousThe place is pretty big bartenders are pretty cool sometimes they do a lot of 80s and dance from the 90s this place is been around for a while nice little spot Mandalay Bay,positive,2214323
We came from the Base and was hungry for brunch  ran into this spot  We were skeptical because it had a drive thru This place is suppose to use all natural ingredients  We wanted breakfast  but when I seen how thin the bacon was  I opted out for their burgers since they said they were award winning  Well  what credited award was it? Because the burger I had was mediocre  It had no flavor and didnt taste the freshness of the beef  The staff was very nice and explained to us about the franchise and thats why this place gets a 3 Star  One person with us didnt even finish her breakfast burrito  Didnt even bother to take the other half home  The salads looked good  But  it seems like the entire farmers story is a facade by using natural as a campaign ,neutral,5962261
My favourite restaurant in Toronto  hands down  Great drinks  excellent menu  gorgeous interior with a vintage vibe  I highly recommend the jerk chickpea burger!,positive,3712634
My roommate and I had them help move furniture into our new apartment  Everything went smooth and was super fast! Not only was the moving crew that helped us polite and on time that morning  but they managed to be very attentive and detail oriented  My roommate had a lot of dresses and outfits that she wanted to move on hangers and not pack into boxes with the rest of our stuff  and they came out with these boxes that allowed you to hang your clothes from a rack inside  It was perfect! They really did think of everything and were all very nice and funny! Definitely made the normal boring and tedious moving experience enjoyable and they were done in no time  I would highly recommend them again to anyone moving in the near future!,positive,3807082
Excellent plus size collection!!!!So thankful!Okay so I went to Azteca Bridal that day    TERRIBLE svc ( you can read the review if you want)I decided i DID NOT want my day to end like that   I called this location and explained to them my situation (at 3pm) they said I could come in at 3:30pm   So they saved the day    but thats not all   I get there  was treated like I was the most important person in the world   Even though they knew I wasnt buying that day  it was okay   I did not feel any pressure to buy  yet I was treated great!  Davids Bridal turned my day around   For sure Ronney,positive,1049257
Z did such a good job on my set  She took her time to make it how I wanted them to be  Sure enough  they look great!!

If I could give ZERO stars  I would  Host messed up our bottle service we waited almost an HOUR for them to figure themselves out and then the security staff was abrasive  abusive  and flat out inappropriate  When asked what the issue was  we couldnt even get a straight answer  Get it together  Im a Vegas local  been here since early 1991  Best believe  I will be telling everyone I know to AVOID this club and this hotel ,negative,3091586

I ate at Bo Ca 7 again on my weekend trip to Phoenix   It was as yummy as it was the first time   We decided to dine outdoors since there was a loud graduation party happening inside with some not so happening music   We ordered the freshly pressed sugarcane and kumquat juice which kept us cool and the thinly sliced beef that you cook yourself in heated vinegar and then wrap with lettuce  mints  and rice paper   Everything was delicious and the atmosphere was lively  yet relaxed (since we sat outside)   Too bad its so HOT in Arizona!,positive,1891997
Finally an honest  reasonable and reliable plumber in Las Vegas  Bryant went above and beyond to help us with a leak  I highly recommend Young Plumbing & Mechanical  you wont be sorry  Im a real estate agent in Las Vegas with 20 years experience so have delt with many different plumbers over the years  and Bryant is the first Ive felt very comfortable recommending ,positive,1115022
My husband and I attended a dinner show last night  We had such a fun time!!! The people at we met were great  The show it self was fun and we laughed all night  Totally worth the $  It was sort of an interactive murder mystery show  I wasnt sure if my husband would like it  but he loved it and we plan to attend one of their other show        Go to one    It was really fun:)$39 that included the chicken dinner  salad and cake  Coffee and water at the tables  Drinks $2 and I think their was drink specials for $6       There is a bar right in the room ,positive,3756718
Just had an Indian head massage with a special scalp treatment done by RIKU!I hope I have spelled  her name right! She also did my eyebrows  She took her time during the head massage  had lots of knowledge  was not rushed and very welcoming  Shes also a perfectionist with brows!

I must admit that not being from Pittsburgh  I walked into this place with very different expectations for what a cheesesteak sandwich constituted  Having said that  while the inclusion of an enormous amount of fries and coleslaw on the sandwich was great  the tiny piece of beef patty that can only be described as something they use as a weight watchers/jenny craig portion leaves much to be desired  I honestly felt like I was eating some sort of vegetarian sandwich with a tiny piece of shriveled up beef patty lost somewhere in between the enormous slices of Italian bread On the plus side  the Oakland location does have a pretty sweet deal for after 10pm  where a sandwich and drink was 3 or 4 bucks ,negative,2482612
Had a great experience today regarding a minor vehicle repair  Was greeted with excellent customer service by Mario and his staff  Mario provided a repair estimate of only $58 which was previously quoted to be over $200 from a different business right down the street  Repair took less than 20 mins from the time I walked in the door  I highly recommend this location for vehicle repairs!,positive,1632052
This was my first time staying at the Flamingo  it was awesome to also discover the Linq Promenade at the same time  They are still putting in new stores and venues  but it was still a nice area to be in during the day  My friend and I hit the 24 hours Starbucks each day  and we had to try the cupcake ATM just once  It was too windy for the high roller  but if I go back I will definitely look it up I saw an ad that they have yoga there  Was a nice small shopping area between two great casinos!,positive,5634003

Ordered a pizza with a 45 minute wait  have been patiently waiting    However  at one hour and ten minutes we called and they said driver was sent out 3 minutes ago  Well we live about two minutes away and were still waiting at 1 hour and 45 minutes  We called once again and they seemed inconvenienced by our concerns  as if it was their job to provide customer service  Keep providing lack luster service  youre doing great!

First time getting a massage at this serene and calming spa by the lake! I was hurting from a recent shoulder problem  but April was able to release the tension she found from that injury as well as other tension in my muscles and deep tissues throughout my body  She left me feeling completely renewed and relaxed  to a point where I totally forgot I was in such pain beforehand  Rick  the owner  couldnt have been nicer and more welcoming to his clientele and staff alike!

Absolutely delicious Sushi near old Vegas   We actually found this place via Yelp while we were in the area  It is super teeny  but so great!!We had a huge party and they accommodated us easily  Side note: you can rent karaoke rooms!!

Whod think Id be reviewing a volcano? Well  you can if youre in Las Vegas!The show is brief  but its definitely a unique spectacle with plenty of good viewing locations  Its certainly worth checking out once  The kids who were watching seemed to really be in awe  It seems quintessential to Vegas  a bit over the top but still entertaining ,neutral,6392310
I was so excited to find a good Tamale place in Charlotte  but very disappointed to find that Tamales La Pasadita fell short of even my most modest expectations  It smells like my great grandmas house and has no music playing    the painful silence allowed me to hear the microwave running in the back constantly  The two women working acted like we were an inconvenience even being there  The tamales were rubbery and steaming from being microwaved  the pozole was also scalding and burnt tasting  The tacos were decent but nothing you cant get elsewhere  Overall very disappointed ,negative,2763677
Crust is a great local place   The service is well timed as well as a fine wine list and tasty appetizers   We always return and will continue to do so ,positive,787937
Pretty impressed with Meet Fresh  Ive heard about this place from my friend who would have it everyday while hes in China  They recently opened one in New York City but havent been to that place yet plus i heard theres always a long line  Visiting my sisters right now in Vegas and they took me there today and we loved it  The mochis were delicious and all the toppings complimented the different things we ordered  We also ordered a drink to share: milk tea with taro  It was something different and i liked it  I believe it was basically just milk tea but with real taro pieces  Most Asian drink places would have taro flavored milk tea but its artificial taro so this was a real treat  I wish they would open one close to me in Brooklyn ,positive,4242928

The service was very friendly but this is just fast food Mexican   I think the quality of the food is good but it isnt exceptional   I found the place perfectly clean   My daughter loved her tacos and I had the enchiladas that were very good but nothing to write home about   The pico was very good and the guacamole was averagebut you cant expect more given the fast food nature of the place   Come here for good food at a reasonable price but dont expect this to be Los Dos Molinos ,neutral,5007311

This sophisticated but friendly neighborhood jewel box of a salon is one of Phoenixs best finds   Lauren Hart  the salon curator has a intuitive sense for whats now and her ability to translate that into the perfect color for your tresses is impeccable   As if the her beautiful young proteges werent enough to keep your eyes entertained  her monthly art exhibits on the wall are   I fly all the way from L A  to get my Roots done here ,positive,5599169
Just OK   The burger itself was delicious but for the price and the presentation  I was expecting a more substantial slab of meat   Its basically midrange quality with better quality toppings   Burgers dont come with fries  but the fries are nowhere near the quality they should have been for having to buy them separately   Too much salt  and the texture was disappointing   The fries are served with two ketchups  Chipotle and Curry  but I didnt care for either  I was looking forward to dipping my fries in regular ketchup but they dont have that   Overall  a resounding meh And what is Gordon Ramsey doing in that huge photo overlooking the dining room with his hands up and his mouth open?  I couldnt help but feel unsettled by this bizarre image staring at me while Im eating   ,neutral,3317529

My Salmon was not cooked how I asked but it was OK  I have had better from here  We also had the cheddar mushrooms for a app  they was pretty good  My husband Outlaw Ribeye said his ribeye was EXCELLENT! Said it was juicy  cooked how he asked and seasoned PERFECT They were super so the wait was about 30 mins  We ended up eating in the bar area  There was a LOT of regulars setting in the bar area which was pretty cool   Customer service was great GREAT WAITRESS!!,positive,3650625
I absolutely adore this little gem of a shop  We have found most of our favorite things here! Everyone that works there has been beyond kind  I am thankful for the local/family business feel  As far as the comments from others complaining about the few things theyll purchase Im thankful theyre selective  Only the staff understand their inventory needs on the day you happen to go in it really shouldnt be taken personally! I have gone in on days where theyll take nearly everything I brought in and other times they dont need much  The owner has a good eye for want she wants in her shop at that time its not her duty to take my stuff just because I happen to think its nice  I am thankful that darling shops like this still exist and I hope they stay around for a long time!,positive,1814493
We got quotes from several pool companies in regards to cleaning our DE filter  His was by far the most reasonable  Rick showed up on time and cleaned our filter which hadnt been cleaned in over 1 year   We were impressed enough with his work to use them as our regular weekly maintenance  Rick was extremely polite  immaculate and professional   Every time I needed to contact Rick by phone  text or email  he was very quick at getting back to me and I know that our business relationship has started off to a good beginning ,positive,6000803

I was disappointed with Rice Trax  We went last week after waiting for it to finally open  The fried rice was way too oily and I couldnt even eat it  My beef was very dry  The macaroni salad is very good though  We ordered the tempera and it was $150 for 3 coin size prices of carrots  It was not absolutely horrible but I wouldnt rush to go back ,neutral,2714265
Are you kidding me?  This concept is a joke at best   I have yet to see the convenience in taking the light rail  unless you both live and work within walking distance   Connections to buses are not convenient  including the connection to the airport   What is normally a 15minute car ride to the airport turned into a 2hour light rail  bus  bus fiasco  with a whole lot of sitting and waiting   You can totally take the rail for free  which I bet most people do   I dont really see the point since it is basically a doublebus on tracks   It has to stop for traffic lights and never seems to get over 30mph   Lame!,negative,330684

We bought a Groupon a while back and decided to use it today  We got the Hang Ten pizza and mozzarella sticks It was okay  I meant to ask for the pizza without onions and green peppers but forgot  I realized my mistaked the second I got in my car and smelled the green peppers  However  I took the green peppers off and was pleasantly surprised to find that the taste didnt linger on the pizza and overwhelm everything else  I left the onions on as it was my wife who asked me to order without onions The pizza was just average  The crust was kind of soggy  The mozzarella sticks were only lukewarm and did not taste homemade  They tasted like something youd get from the freezer section of your local grocery store I might try it again  but I doubt Ill be a regular ,negative,5957442
Ive only been in once and I have mixed feelings   The bartender wasnt very attentive   In terms of attitude  Id say she was subpar   Not the most friendly bartender Ive met   But I do give her credit for keeping my beer glass full   The food here is good   Some of the best bar food youll find in town   The thai shrimp was outstanding  but I did feel the portion was too small for the price   The fried calamari and chicken wings were good   The supreme pizza was really good   I love the crispy crust and to go with the was soft and chewy dough   It annoys me when the bottom of the pizza crust is underdone and not crispy   I like mine to have some char to it and this place does pizza right!!  If you want good bar food  this place should certainly be on your list   If you want good service  it can be hit or miss ,neutral,3067072
Food was decent  Went there for lunch and had a good Caesar salad with average tortilla soup  My friends soup didnt come out at the same time however  When I asked our server  David  when my friends food was coming he gave me attitude and walked away  I think that reaction from him was absurd when I merely asked a question  I might go back  but I wont have David serving me ,neutral,1223291
Came in this morning excited for variety and decent prices and was fairly disappointed  Now  I was able to get a half dozen with a cappuccino for $13 BUT the donuts tasted weird   almost as if the oil it was cooked in was recycled   just not the normal tasting donuts and not in a good way  The raisin croissant was OK but for sure nothing to rave about  The cappuccino was  by far  the most disappointing  Kinda strong but didnt taste that great  cup was not full  and cup size is the child cup size at Starbucks (and i think that might even be a little bigger)  I did grow up in a Cuban home so at first  I figured maybe it was strong enough to where I didnt need a giant cup and that was partially true  Either way  I paid $3 50 for a tiny cup of cappuccino  The place was really clean and decorated  I wont be back because Im about quality and more than a shot n a half of coffee  Ill stick with Pink Box and Starbucks,negative,687113
So unique  finally Vegas is beginning to have a culture  Food was a little greasy  but great  Awesome happy hour with food and drink specials!

This secret little hole in the wall is a little difficult to find  but it is located on the third floor in between a sushi restaurant and a blue/purple neon lit glass elevator  Just follow the narrow hallway (full of tiles) and its located at the end  Now to the pizza  the pizza slices are pretty big and theyre pretty good  The pepperoni and sausage one was the best in my opinion  The pizza is a little overpriced as well as the pitchers of beers  but not enough to keep customers from coming back ,positive,5595024
I had not been to this location of Mad Mex since my undergraduate days; I usually go to the Shadyside location  Yesterday I went here with some from friends from out of town  and I was not thrilled with my usual order: southwestern wings  Theyre so good  I get them all the time  However  they were fairly dry and lacking in sauce yesterday  At the Shadyside location  my wings are smothered in the sauce with some to spare if I choose to dip my chicken it  I will continue to go to the Shadyside location as there is also more room to breathe there ,neutral,2146470

They seat you promptly and wait staff are very attentive  The food is good  generous portions  tasty  and presented nicely  The menu is alright  I would like more local fare with more specials but  as a chain  they do a good job! The beer selection is decent  with even a few craft beer selections  I am partial to IPAs and they dont carry anybut they do have OMB Copper on tap! This is a good place  with great service  good food  and nice atmosphere  Perfectly located in GTown as well! Check them OUT!,positive,2242855

Ive enjoy the rotisserie chicken and super sides at this neighborhood hang out for 30 years over which time it is evolved into as much as a casual sports bar as a diner  It does both well As a diner  everything is freshly made  delicious and  as evidenced by my photos  served in generous portions  All chicken options are winners and I love the black bean salad  Even the condiment bar  with sweet vinegary onions  and 3 different salsas including a red hot pico  is special  Unfortunately the corn bread was not  On my last visit it was cold  dry on the inside and soggy on the outside   Of course  I do realize thats being a little picky  but hey  I love corn bread and was looking forward to it As a bar  it is nearly open air and has a real beachy vibe  The first time visitor would be as comfortable as the regular  Theres decent draft beer choices and the usual bottled beer selection  Service is friendly and attentive at both ,positive,3043430

We tried to visit shortly after 8pm for a cocktails noticing the bar was empty  My fiancee isnt a fan of smoking establishments but having heard the HVAC system was in disrepair and smoking is currently not permitted inside  we figured it was a great opportunity to give it a try The door was graciously opened for us only to be told we could not come in because I was wearing a hat and tshirt   As we walked away we also noticed several people on the patio enjoying drinks and cigars wearing hats and tshirts   I looked on the website to find a dress code however  I could find nothing more than all the cities in which they have establishments   I work in an establishment with a cigar concept and for a business that makes recommendations for local businesses   While I was eager to see what this place had to offer  I dont see myself in a hurry to visit again nor recommend it to anyone ,negative,6120577

This place was AMAZING!!! My 9 month old has severe chest congestion and I didnt feel comfortable waiting the whole weekend to see a Dr so we decided to come here  GREAT DECISION! They open at 9am  We got there and Ashley at the front desk was so kind and pleasant  Even offered coffee  The waiting room is so cute and kept my little guy distracted from feeling so crummy   The Dr and nurse were both so kind and very patient with my son who was a bit afraid of being there  We were in and out in under 2 hours  They listened to our concerns and really checked him out  In todays world where customer service isnt the main priority  it is so nice to see that doesnt apply with this urgent care  I would recommend this place to anyone needing care for their kiddos  They even service teens and have a separate section for them so they dont feel like babies with all the decor  This place was awesome!,positive,5543904
This is the best Mexican food Ive had in Montreal  and I know what Mexican is supposed to taste like  Im from New Mexico  Everything is made in house  including the superb tortilla chips  The guacamole here is fresh and the chile is delicious  This place puts 3 Amigos to shame and its open until 4am ,positive,5332645
Came here on a Tuesday afternoon and we are leaving very happy! The food was great!

I love this place and their prices are fair  They only charge me $38 to do a full groom  hair cut  nail trim and teeth brushing  The is the BEST value around and it is GOOD QUALITY services  Anyone who wants to complain about the pricing  you can always take your pup to places like pet smart or pet people and their pricing starts at $55 and go up from there  I have never had a problem and my little pooch always looks fabulous when I have him groomed at Tip of the Tail,positive,2433905

I feel like every time I order here the pizza always taste different  Sometimes its good and cheesy and sometimes it taste completely different! Not sure if they have different cooks all the time and if they were all trained different  Its a hit and miss with this place! And somehow I still coming back  Its convenience since I live right down the st  Place seems to stay packed and I have better luck dinning in  Customer services is legit and they serve beer (when I really need it) family friendly place and I love to order there gigantic pizzas!

I was convinced that I would hate beer all my life  but thankfully I can say I was wrong  I happened to come here with my boyfriend while he was on beer refilling trip  not really expecting anything from this place  My boyfriend urged me to try come beer here  as according to him  its the best in Calgary  After much refusal  I gave in and tried some Sunshine Lager  It went down nice and smooth and tasted great  Also had some of their pizza there  which was also amazing  The pizzas are a burst of flavor with a crispy crust  I recommend everyone to go  beer and pizza  a great combination  A bonus  they sell their brews for very cheap  much cheaper than getting it at a regular liquor store ,positive,2711716

We stumbled upon upon this restaurant after asking 2 locals for the best place for an afternoon lunch  They suggested we take advantage of the beautiful weather and eat at  La Terrace  This was the perfect choice! The ambiance alone was amazing  We wanted to have the true Canadian experience so we ordered Poutine  It taste way better than it looks  You have to try it at least once  The sangria with white wine was amazing  a nice drink to have on a summer day  The burgers were also good along with the fries  Overall I highly recommend this place when in Old Montreal ,positive,6114092
I visited Carens during summer for cheese fondue  Inside was very classy the tableware and everything was set very beautifully When I went  there was only one person working  this was at around 2pm  Im not sure if it was because of this that my experience wasnt so great  Being a waitress and I believed responsible for making the dishes  as I saw her making our fondue The cheese fondue was alright we also had chocolate fondue  It was presented beautifully and tastes average  Overall everything was ok not a spectacular experience  I expected more ,neutral,2680210

Purchased a small assortment of mini bags for my husband  as an anniversary gift  I got most of what I knew he would like  and some of what I thought I would like  He was THRILLED with the gift  All of the flavors are exactly what he would have chosen himself  I was a little skeptical about the Southwest Hot Wings  but man was it GOOD! The flavor was subtle and not overpowering  I also purchased Loaded Baked Potato  Strawberry Cheesecake  Blueberry  Red Hot Cinnamon  Butterfinger  Coconut  and a few others  We will definitely be ordering more in the near future I would LOVE to see some other flavors  like RootBeer  Cola  Creme Brulee  and some others that I just cant think of right now      I remember eating candied popcorn as a kid  I also knew of a store that was close to a restaurant I used to go to  I have been looking for a shop  like this for a while  but could only find stores that offered the usual  cheese and caramel popcorn ,positive,4268318

I like the food here  but I always do carry out because the service isnt all that great  Once I had a Long Island and at the bottom was something bright red  like a piece of cherry or something  So I got it out and realized it was broken glass! I asked the bartender if I could have a new drink due to the glass  She replied  yeah I saw that in there but thought you put it in there  How did I put it in there if YOU served me the drink with it in there?

Just saw Willy Wonka Jr today and it was an amazing youth production  You can tell this is a top of the line youth production  The bathrooms were clean  plenty of parking  and many concessions to choose from  My only complaint would be that the lobby is very small and does not accommodate many when people are waiting  Although there is some outside seating it cannot be utilized during the summer  I believe they are moving into to the mall so possibly that will take care of that problem ,positive,3350710

My family went to the restaurant and although the restaurant had a lot of empty tables  the waiters made us wait for 15min to eventually tell us we are understaffed and we cannot serve you and they rudely yelled this at us and walked away  There was also noone to seat people  In order to even talk to the waiters and get this rude response  I asked a waitress if we could sit down at a table because my parents are seniors and their legs are tired  My parents ate here in the past  but we will not return ,negative,3697991

They are inconsistent with the charges for their tailoring  She kept using the language barrier  as if she didnt understand my request  after I had already paid her for the alterations I thought she was going to do  She asked me if I was rich  which I find extremely offensive and unprofessional  I was charged more and more for the same alterations as time went on  I just got sick of the worsening service,negative,5107476

I have quickly realized that North Charlotte is the citys redheaded stepchild  and it shows in the upkeep of many of the businesses in that area   At International Supermarket  it means you have to navigate potholes galore to find a parking spot   Unfortunately  the outside mirrors whats going on the inside   I am no stranger to Asian supermarkets and I have to confess  I was not too impressed with this one   The smell  I can deal with (an open air display of fish greet you at the entrance)  Even the surly teenage kids checking you out  I can deal with   However  I could not deal with the disorganized aisles and roadblocks of boxes throughout the store  That said  I found here the very thing I came here looking for: Shitaki tofu and yam noodes   This *may* be the only place in Charlotte that carries them  so for that reason (and only that reason)  I will likely return ,negative,2274089

Decided to give it a try based on the reviews   I expected a totally untraditional buffet after reading through the reviews   It ended up being a pretty traditional buffet  with the exception that many items were served in smaller contained dishes (the harder to load things up on your plate)   There was a pretty good selection of food   Standout items for us included the kalbi ribs  fried rice  caprese salad  watermelon salad (watermelon disk sitting on some balsamic glaze with a dollop of mascarpone) and shrimp cocktail   Crab legs were a huge disappointment  wimpy snow crab clusters that did not look edible  didnt even go there   Flourless chocolate cake was delicious and my son enjoyed the ice cream selection I have been to Bacchanal for brunch and I would imagine that dinner is just as fantastic   I would probably opt for Bacchanal next time but overall  we did enjoy Wicked Spoon   Crab legs are really the draw for me at a buffet and Wicked Spoon did not come through!,positive,832817
Went for breakfast with a girlfriend and our daughters on a Saturday morning about a month ago  The service was great and the food was also  I liked that they had an iced coffee option  I would recommend this restaurant ,positive,6218060
Sprinkles reached out to me since my terrible experience and not so great review and asked me to give them another chance   That was very professional of them and exhibited exceptional customer service  I gladly accepted   This time the experience was excellent   The cupcakes were fresh  moist  and delicious   If they can keep consistent with my last visit  I will happily be a fan again   Thank you for reaching out and paying attention to your customers  it means a lot and also wins them back!,positive,4568077
After staying in Calgary for a couple of days  we were delighted to discover this amazing little restaurant  We arrived slightly too late for the brunch menu the first day  and instead opted for a burger & fries  It was handsdown one of the best burgers Ive ever had  We sat on the back patio  which was cozy & busy  We had such a great experience here that we came back several days later on our stop through town to try the breakfast we missed out on the first time around  Their eggs benny (regular & smoked salmon) was also very good  We highly recommend this place  though its a shame the hours are a bit limited  Do seek it out if you are in the area  its definitely worth arranging your schedule to fit it in ,positive,207906

This review is for the bar only  This is what I want heaven to be like  flowing dunkel  drunk friendly people  the best cover band in the land  and bier cheese that I would literally kill for If you would rather drink  dance  sing and have a good time over grinding randomly COME HERE! If you just wanna grind and hook up dont come here you wont have fun  I have been to A LOT of bars and this is my overall favorite  I go at least once a month hopefully more ,positive,5585617
We accidentally bought tickets to the Robinson theater and didnt realize until we went to check into our movie  The manager was more than accommodating for our mistake and got us into another movie making sure we were satisfied even telling us if we didnt want to stay he would get us movie passes for another time  Seriously one of the nicest people Ive ever dealt with in the service industry  We ended up not staying because we really didnt want to see the other movie available but will definitely be back  Nice theater  amazing chairs and clean ,positive,5940406
When I was younger  this was the church that I was dragged to every Sunday against my will  As much as I may not have enjoyed the whole mass aspect of things  I will give St  Mikes the fact that their church is absolutely gorgeous  Id have to say this building is probably one of my favourites in the entire downtown core  Toronto doesnt have a lot of stunning architecture  but this churchs spooky gates and stained glass windows tend to make me drop my jaw in awe every time They also do some great stuff with their Out of the Cold program and other services for the homeless  not to mention food drives and stuff The church is just steps away from the Eaton Centre  so if youre visiting the city and in the mood to take a break from all that consumerism and get some peace and quiet  St  Mikes is worth exploring ,positive,6352046

The Best Dark Dirty Sexy Punk BAR in Vegas! I used 2 live in Vegas and I am glad that I got 2 enjoy soooo many great Bands here  This is a small venue and a nice break from the Normal Vegas  Its in what locals call the Fruit loop (like 4 gay bars) all next to this dirty bar  So please do not be a Hateful person  Yes  this bar is a required stop for all you old school and Punk rock kids ,positive,4727716

Still here at this ihop location and not off to a good start  It seems that no one wants to clean tables coz theres so many dirty tables  It seems none of the staff is interested in cleaning tables  Service is not so good  Water is room temperature because their ice maker is busted  What??? That couldnt just happen! My last visit here definitely ,negative,4594065
We have been using PIP for several years  and very pleased with the service  Gabriella is a wonderful team leader  and makes sure everything is done correctly before leaving  She is pleasant  courteous and a great advocate for the company  I would recommend PIP to anyone who is looking for a team they can trust to get the job done right Cheryl,positive,6042418
Im rewriting my review on this place for 2 reasons  First  because the first time I came here was back in 2009  Second  when I came here the most recent time  it was not like my first  Im gonna make this short and simple for you non readers  The burger was tasteless  I understand the reason for the unlimited amount of toppings you can add to your burger  But even A1 steaksauce  chipotle sauce and banana peppers cant hide the taste of dry ground beef  Come on Cheeburger  even Chilis has their own flavor!!! I was very disappointed when I came back here  but im over it now since I wont be back again ,negative,3169122
donuts & pizza are to die for!!! A bit of a drive but well worth it!!,positive,6570500
Came here with a large group for lunch  and the place was packed  Our service was attentive throughout our meal and everything came out in good time  Everything I tasted was great  from our appetizer of sweet potato chips to my main the short rib tacos and black bean mango salad  The decor inside the restaurant was appealing as well  Ill be returning soon ,positive,676072
I had three drinks  The last one was totally unnecessary but was still delicious  The first drink I had was called Air something  It was really good and Cinnamony  Reminded me of a Pisco Sour but stronger  Then I had two Limon Dees  The menu describes them as a Key Lime Pie with a bite  and that is spoton  It tastes exactly like drinking a Key Lime Pie  Sooo good  My friend had a Zombie  The dry ice made it look and sound like a bubbling cauldron  It was impressive  We sat in this little side room that had two tables  It was cozy but really hard to see   We also had some black bean salsa which was very good  I would suggest taking a cab or having a DD  Any more than one drink and you wont want to be driving ,positive,2165719
Authentic Italian food in Phoenix  The Cannelloni was outstanding as was the pasta fagioli soup  and gnocchi  All fresh and made to order  Great service as well and the kids (11 & 13) loved the food as well ,positive,381554

I had my reservations when the dark haired girl at the counter looked me up and down and walked away  After she charged me $22 for soup and a sandwich  After pointing out the discrepancy I was met with a blank look of indifference  After searching for recent lobotomy scars and finding none  I surmised that she just couldnt muster any sort of customer service etiquette  The other girl made our sandwich without so much as asking us what kind of bread we wanted  However  the food was tasty but waaay overpriced,negative,2143402
A good place to catch a game or two  Also their nightly specials after 8 are pretty good  They are a great place to snag a slice of pizza and a cold beer  They have the basic selection  Also they do have some pretty good dessert choices ,neutral,92160
This is the place to be for great beer and food  The atmosphere is always lively and Ive always had good service regardless of party size  First timers  make sure to try Four Peaks famous Kilt Lifter beer  Im personally a huge fan of Sunbru and Peach Ale  In terms of food  the chicken strips are delicious  The four peaks menu also includes beer recommendations based on your order  Parking is a little bit challenging  but there is always space if youre willing to walk a little bit  The four peaks parking lot is small  but you can park in the alley in the back of the brewery or along 8th street  Definitely a place Id recommend visiting if youre visiting Tempe and looking for some good brews ,positive,5349746
I love this store! There is nothing negative to say about it it is always clean and there are always such cute things  Trendy and affordable! The girls who work there are always willing and able to help with anything you need whether it be finding something to match an outfit or asking random questions I have not had any negative experience in the store  My friend and I were even there after closing and they did not try to rush us or kick us out ,positive,2460162
The wife and I visited this place on Saturday   We first tried the guacamole which we both thought had a little too much onion   I had the California  Fish  and Carnitas tacos and thought they were all very good   They are much bigger than street tacos so be careful and not over order   My wife had the Crispy Avo and the Fish tacos   She also thought they were very good   We will be back for sure  especially for the happy hour drinks ,positive,5045184
I took my truck in today for a detail and was greeted by Tyler  He was extremely pleasant and very informative  He explained all options and the difference between certain options  He told me my truck would be done around 4  When I arrived at 3:45 my truck had just been completed  Tyler brought me my keys and went through the truck with me  I am extremely pleased with the quality of work  and the attention to detail that was spent on my vehicle  I am very pleased and will most defiantly be a return customer ,positive,2643834
Im not a fan of all you can eat Asian food  because I know the quality isnt there   Id much prefer quality over quantity when talking about food   I must say though sushi mon is legit   They make all the sushi fresh to order   You just tell the waitress or sushi chef what you want and they make it right there   The variety of different sashimi / sushi rolls / appetizers makes this place well worth the $26 95 for dinner   There are some sashimis that you can only order just one per person because of how expensive it is  but at least you get to try it still   The people working there were really nice   It wasnt too busy  but I herd when it gets busy that the food takes awhile to come out   You have to make sure that you eat all your food along with the rice or else youll get charged extra   Ill definitely come back to this place when I come back to Vegas!,positive,2930955
Had a really great dinner here for valentines  The pizza was fantastic as usual but we decided to dine in this time for the holiday  We took my five year old out for her valentines date  The place seems to be run by a family and they give really awesome service  It was busy but our waitress was on top of it and it never felt like we were in a busy place  There was a relaxing atmosphere that made dinner so enjoyable  So excited to have a new place right across the street  They even brought my daughter a cannoli  which she thought was the coolest thing ever  $4 for her own personal pizza was a bomb deal too! Their IPA was tasty and the salad  Really everything was just perfect ,positive,1639343
This is a great Las Vegas RV dealer  Its evidently the largest RV dealer in the State  and they provide topnotch service all around Christine helped us get a good deal on a nice coach  She was helpful throughout the purchase process  not pushy at all  and answered all our questions patiently  After the purchase  a courteous mechanic named Matt took about 3 hours of his time to teach us all about the onboard systems  which was all new to us being firsttime RVers It was overall a great experience with Johnnie Walker RV  and I just happened to meet Mr  Johnnie Walker in person on the back lot  He was extremely courteous  shook my hand  and welcomed us to his family business  Its no wonder things run so well  it all starts at the top ,positive,5211878
I can see how this Sbux would get really busy  and cramped  Luckily  each time I stopped by I have been in the clear  They have a few good seating options inside  and a fair sized patio  The location on the corner of Bloor and Albany makes for some good people watching  Overall  it isnt a location I would find myself going out of my way for by any means  Mostly due to the layout and the business factor  ,negative,1956796

We are new to Charlotte  so were driving around for a brunch place  when we found this spot on Yelp We stopped by and asked how long is the wait and the answer was   1 5 hours!

I saw Chris Delia here when he was in town and he was hilarious  The talent that they are able to secure here is amazing  1 thing I dont like is that you have to get a 2 drink minimum per person after paying for a 25 dollar ticket Other than that its a great spot for a date night!,positive,2584895
We are regulars at the hotel which my dad always plays at we  and we just checked in  Weve never had such a terrible check in experience  This review is not for hotel but rather the experience at the front desk  There was some confusion about our two rooms and our floors   The lady checking us iN  Natalie was her name  was rude and cold as ice which is not typical of Wynn customer service check in  She was not helpful at all and we re so disappointed at the way we were treated  I think maybe the the management should not put people with attitudes at the front as someones first welcome ,neutral,5948100
I dont think that you could have made my appt go any better   It was great as usual!  Dr Cordray is very caring and takes the time to listen to you and explain things to you   The other staff members are extremely polite and friendly and the facility is always clean and fresh whenever I bring Freddie in   I am very pleased with AAH and would not hesitate to recommend the vet practice to anyone   I am so glad that my sister told me about it when I moved to NLV ,positive,2029650

I want to leave 0 Stars at this establishment  Let me start off by saying I went to this place because I had a GROUPON  It was for 2 large pizzas 2 liter soda and 2 cheesecakes  We get there after driving across town and the guy at the counter says they were no longer honoring groupons  I was PISSED! I bought it so you have to honor it  They refused and he offered me 10% off my pruchase  I wanted to deck him in the face  Obviously this guy knows nothing about customer service  because thats not how you keep people coming back to your establishment  STAY AWAY!!,negative,2692376
We met a friend here for a dinner a couple of weeks ago based on her recommendation   We hadnt been to Barrio Queen since it opened  so decided to have an open mind and give it another shot   Our biggest complaint last time was service and that was quickly overcome   we had a great server that was attentive and super helpful   I ordered the enchiladas suizas and again  they were good  but not great   I keep comparing them to Barrio Cafe and there is just no comparison   Overall  a great experience  lively atmosphere  nice decor  great service and good food!,positive,6077026
I really wanted to like this place because I love the concept of flavorful and healthy Asian   I opted for the noodle bowl with chicken and a mixture of coco and curry sauces   For a meager $6 you get a pile of food!  I didnt read the menu close enough to know that the bowl is assembled with noodles on the bottom  and then a salad mixture of greens  carrots  water chestnuts  snap peas and cucumber   Then which ever protein and sauce you pick is placed on top   I found the food to be a bit on the bland side (probably because they dont use salt)   And I did not care for greens but that is my fault   Maybe if I go back and 86 the greens and put some salt and pepper on it I will feel differently   Friendly and fast  walk up and carry out service ,neutral,2561633
I love this place  Its like the qdoba or chipotle of Mediterranean food  Its high quality  great prices  and delicious  Ive been here about a dozen times and every time the service is great  Im always greeted and everyone is super friendly  Parking is available out front and also in the garage  My favorite is the chicken gyro with pasta salad ,positive,2453428

Chang Jiang is awesome! Its close to my house so its super easy for pickup  Sometimes its not even necessary to call ahead! We just drop by and order in person and it will be out in 510 minutes!

This review pertains to all Ulta Stores Ive ever been in (I just happened to be in this Ulta today )  Whenever I step into ANY Ulta  its rare that anyone might say hello (much less than welcome me to the store)   God forbid I would need help!   Yesterday several store associates passed by me without saying hello and to ask if I may need help!  I was recently in Sophora in Scottsdale   There was an associate there to greet me and hand me a basket and ask if I may need help finding something   Every associate I passed in the store said hello and if they could help with anything   When I checked out they thanked me for being a new customer and please come again   I appreciate that!  I will never shop at Ulta (anywhere) again!,negative,5592796

Must have been an off night at the Bouchon Bistro  My wife and I had a party of six and went early for a drink  We sat across from the bar for a minimum of 20 minutes and finally had to ask if we could get a drink  Well ten minutes later our guest arrived and still no drinks  So we were seated  It get worse  We ordered a white and red bottle for the table  The white was put on ice away from our table  We had a second bottle of  red and they never poured the girls any more white  The food was in the OK range but Ive definitely had a better meal at LAVO restaurant  It was just a let down and our expectations were not met  Oh yes  One more thing and a pet peeve of mine  the water glass went empty too many times!,negative,3641912

Best  Chinese  Food  In  The  Burgh  Their sichuan chili oil is legit  I love their food  You really cant go wrong with their dishes  except the eggplant  Their eggplant is too heavy loaded with vinegar and leans a bit on the sour side  But other than that  their whole fish casserole is AMAZING   as is their deep fried intestines  kung pao chicken  mapo tofu  beef noodle soup  There are never lines when I come for lunch or dinner  Parking is manageable in the lots nearby   You do have to pay though (unless its a Sunday) ,positive,559163
Well well well obviously this place is super popular  but for us this was our first time and we couldnt have been more surprised by how amazing Culinary Dropout truly was! Because of all the great tips and reviews found on Yelp we decided to get the BBQ Pork belly Nachos and the Soft Pretzel & Provolone Fondue and man oh man you guys were totally right! These dishes were soooo tasty and just overall fun to munch on while watching Sunday football! Once we were completely satisfied with the great food and amazing service we got to enjoy ourselves with all the fun activities they offer including: cornhole (bean bag toss)  shuffleboard  ping pong  and even foosball! My girlfriend and I had so much fun discovering this place with my parents!   We will definitely be back to this super fun  tasty  and overall awesome place they call Culinary Dropout! 10/10,positive,6202931

Absolute MUST for anyone planning on visiting Vegas  This is a gem of a restaurant  located inside the NYNY Hotel and Casino :)Where do I start? Their steaks are delicious and juicy and they have probably the best bread pudding I have ever had   Not to mention the amazing live music that starts at 9pm! Definitely not your typical  on the strip  restaurant  The place is lively  dimlit  and I always see people having a good time when they are here  I make it a point to go here every time im in Vegas If you pick a seat with a view of the balcony and the stage  youll be set for some good ol fashioned Irish folk dancing and tunes by the Nine Fine Irishmen (Yes  this place is named after the amazing band that plays here) Overall: Great environment  happy times and great food! What else can you ask for?!,positive,144871

I was hankering to give this one a go with reviews showing up in NYC publications and BlogTO   Vintage cocktails  alleyway entrance  conversational atmosphere and reservations via texting day of are the prohibition style allure (ok  except for text messaging    probably a password instead)   Im a fan of this style patronizing Bourbon and Branch in SF  Manifesto in KC and the Violet Hour in Chi   Our Toronto incarnation wins points for location and friendly staff but could use some improvement in matching the cocktail quality of other cities   The other options are a bit more creative and crafted sometimes even named   We went early at 8:15pm as we were pregaming the shoe so we were the first to arrive  I will definitely try to make it back another night ,positive,2722399

Its a fun place  and our Party pro  Jesse  was amazing and attentive  howeverour 6 year olds birthday was completely divided  Those taller in the class were allowed in the trampolines  and shorter than 46 inches only allowed in kiddie court  The kids tried to make it work   but the taller 6 year olds werent allowed in kiddie court and shorter not allowed in trampoline; kids werent able to play together at all! Individually and as a family it was fun  but for s bday party  if the kids are not all the same height   it will be frustrating! In my opinion  too expensive to not be allowed to all play in the same area!,neutral,3247338
Wow  absolute works of art!

I have been to many ramen restaurants over Vegas and this was one of the worst for me   I ordered the teriyaki ton ramen  The bbq pork was the best part it was delicious and juicy thats what saves this place from a 2 star rating The broth was not flavorful and it was very greasy  the menu claimed there was spice and I barely tasted any spice  I left feeling unsatisfied   which sucks because Ramen is one of my all time favorite foods Strongly dislike having to give a ramen place 3 stars but I have to because the quality in the broth here needs to improve   ,neutral,2228844

I was pleasantly surprised to learn that there was a Tropical Smoothie in the Whitney Ranch area  I always drove by it  but now I wished that I had never stopped in Was not greeted when I entered  stood at the register for about 5 minutes before anyone even acknowledged my presence  and then I was told we will be right with you  Nearly another 10 elapsed before my order was taken with a very curt sorry  Drinks were bland and just as we were about to leave  one of the workers nearly crashed into my wife as she bounded around the corner to the bathroom (lord only knows why)  Wish I had read the reviews before we stopped in  Never going back there again ,negative,2749600
I was in need of a Pressure Washer repair on a Saturday morning  I called a few shops listed near me and was met with  ah  we close at noon  its gonna be a 2 week turnaround  or they had an attitude (over the phone) that they werent much interested with helping me out with a Saturday morning fix  I kept looking and finally found a small engine repair shop in Glendale  Croft Mechanical  Not only did the owner (Tom Croft) answer the phone promptly while on his lunch break (noon time)  he could notice I was in immediate need of a repair  As a result I had my pressure washer repaired within 2 hours and at a reasonable cost with a friendly business willing to jump through hoops to satisfy a customer and on a Saturday  WHATA IDEA!,positive,2732264

I stayed here about 6 months ago  and the hotel was fine  However on this trip it was a different story  From the rude clerk at the front desk it went downhill  Only one elevator was working  my room wasnt cleaned  The bathroom was filthy  the towels were thread bare and frayed  a couple even had holes  The TV reception faded in and out  I called Ms Rude at the front desk and was told the reception wasnt the hotels problem  The ice machines werent working  and that was not their problem either  Guess the hotel has no problems! I did find out the root of the problem  The hotel has hired a new manager  That explains most of the problems  Time to hire a new manager and restore the hotel to how it was 6 months ago  ,negative,2604412
I loved my experience! I have a gluten allergy and used to understanding every restaurant wont be able to accommodate me  This was an amazing experience! I loved my garlic chicken and they even allowed me to substitute some fresh kale! Amazing price and AMAZING service! Thank you Stuart for the great rest stop!,positive,2466110
Jumped in here on a cold night after wandering around too long   Great choice!Started with onion rings and moved to fish tacos and ahi tuna salad  All was tasty  We were on a slow clock and the server was very accommodating and pleasant  Place has a nice buzz between the music  lots of TVs (Chopped rules)  and a steady supply of clientele for people watching  Enjoyable visit and would come back!,positive,3316670
Wonderful place!  One of a kind gifts  beautiful flowers and personal arrangements   A must see!  And shop place!!!,positive,6421252
The service at this restaurant was horrible! We sat at our tables with our menus closed for 15 minutes before having to ask for a server  Even after another 5 minutes  a manager showed up  and we still didnt have a server  And the kicker was that the restaurant was empty!! Completely disappointing  Go to 360!,negative,4995128
I went to Corbins today after hiking at North Mountain  We arrived at about noon and were seated right away  We shared the Asian chicken salad and the asparagus quesadilla  The salad was supposed to have a spicy peanut dressing  but it wasnt spicy at all    but it was fresh and overall an alright salad  but nothing to write home about  The quesadilla was very good however  It was actually a cheese crisp  but it was flavorful and the asparagus and artichoke had a smoky flavor and were very tender    delicious  Would definitely go back for this again ,positive,2818380
This location is different from the one in downtown  its a dine in restaurant  was greeted right away by CARLOS  He was our server and was nothing but awesome  excellent customer service very sweet! They gave my son their signature tater tots on the house which was very nice  I got the reubenish and husband got fish and chips  it was good  but we ended up taking it home cause we got full from eating the tater tots  I do like the set up in there everything is modern which is what I like ,positive,5371192
I went to IKEA today to exchange a part from a desk I purchased  I didnt have a receipt since it was a gift & Carl from Exchanges & Returns was phenomenal!

I was in last night Jan 2 at closing to purchase paper towels of course I left with a cart FILLED with stuff    standard Target trip    I feel in Love with an end table that formally was $64 and it was on sale for 21 I only bought one I then went home unpacked set up my end table and realized you know what I shouldve gotten the second one so I went in first thing in the morning the following day January 3 and there was a gentleman named Mark working and he was amazing he did his best to help me find the other end tables but the department was took apart earlier in the day by his manager and all of the end tables were sold to one to customer but I was really blown away by his customer service looking and searching for the item   it wad not even his department  Thank you Mark!!,positive,2732148

Maybe because I havent had a buffet in awhile  maybe cuz it was a weekday and not weekend & maybe because we went at 1030a and had breakfast and lunch or maybe cuz it was free!  But I enjoyed it and dont understand all the negative reviews   Yea its not the best and not at caesars level but even if I had to pay for 21 99 thats not bad at all   Plus the service was outstanding   Go when its not hectic right before lunch & enjoy the wide selection ,positive,3589928
Im really surprised on how much people hate on this location   The only reason I didnt give it 5 stars is because it is pricey   But other than that  I really enjoy just walking around the Grand Canal Shoppes   I think its fun  and fanciful  which is what Vegas is all about   If you are going to look around for flaws      really?  Its sin city   I can find a lot of other things to point out ,positive,2946819
CASH ONLY!!! Good Service!!As far as the food is concerned  Ill just say I am not impressed   Its TOO cheap!  I am not looking for the cheapest price for the cheapest food   I am not a college freshman anymore   Instead  I am looking for QUALITY food at a reasonable price   With that being said  you can taste the cheapness in the food The service was top notch however   I cannot say enough about how friendly the staff was   This might be the one and only place I would go back to DESPITE the food and simply for the service ,negative,620999
My first time at this location  The atmosphere is Not as nice as the Indian school location  but its still great  Service was fast and spot on  Order the brisket Mac and cheese and was pleasantly surprised ,positive,3721645
The interior is awesome!!  The salsa and chips are really good   I got the pork adovado and my friend had the al pastor   Both were excellent   I wasnt impressed with the beef or the tres leche and the service was soso   If youre going for lunch during work  expect to stay a while as the service is pretty slow ,neutral,4911452
I would definitely give this place 5 stars mostly because of the food  The deep dish pizza is soooo good  But the server was training and she came off really rude to the trainee   I felt kinda bad for him   I asked for no ice im my bevs and got a bunch of ice and My table didnt get any refills of our drinks and it took forever to get the bill  But the food was too good tho make it a bad experience ,positive,2861633
I eat here all the time  I love salad  Lots of salad  Actually  if i could be anything in the world  id be salad dressing so i could hug salad all the time   You see  when ur starving  health conscious and indecisive   this place always leaves u proud to be full of leaves n things  Sometimes i wish i could eat there twice a day but that would be ridiculous even for me   Their hot food sucks  but idc  Im a two plate salad person   If ur a student  they offer discounts  Sometimes i dream about my next salad in class n doing fancy things with dressings  Like putting some on the bottom of the salad! Genius! The staff is friendly  I love people watching n this place does it for me too   Oh n its cheap as hell   Plus theres a nice park behind the building   Only thing i wish is that it was open 24/7   Its 6:45 am n im craving greenzzzz ,positive,2039540
Very good place and cheaper than China Buffet  I think the selection of food items is more as well  On the weekends ( sat and sun) they have dim sum all day as well  Definitely be going here again $8 99 for lunch $12 99 for dinner after 4pm,positive,5830652
We stopped in on a busy Sunday morning  While waiting in line to order I couldnt resist a sticky bun  it looked just like those my grandma used to make  I also had to try the jalapeno cheddar bagel  My husband ordered the Waffle Breakfast Sandwich scrambled egg  cheddar  ham  with bechamel sauce  It was the highlight by far  Thankfully  he shared some with me for exchange of some of my bagel  The bagel was very good as well  Great vessel for a sandwich  in fact  Id the breakfast sandwich on that rather than the waffle  Another time  perhaps  The sticky bun was a big disappointment  It was a rock  The appearance totally fooled me  this was nothing like grandma would make Service was spotty  my order was incomplete and I had to make it a point to collect my bagel ,neutral,6112128
If i could do a zero star review I would  So about 2 months ago I was in this location and after waiting 30 minutes and a lobby full of people a new client comes in and gets to go in front of everyone thats been waiting  I left a review following that incident and my next visit the Dr  called me back to the office and asked me to change my review because they got in trouble for it and tried to explain why one persons pain is more important than anothers  So i change the review and go back in today  Well guess what happened again  I was waiting this time for 20 minutes  I was next up  and a giy walks in  checks in  and gets called back next  Looking thru the reviews there is another client that has had this happeb as well  so its not an isolated incident  This location obviously needs to learn how to take clients in the order they come in  As this location is the closest one to my house I am going to cancel my membership and find a chiropractor that actually cares about the clients ,negative,3108327

I would have given this place 4 start but the poutine cheeseburger combo with a Jones drink came to $17???? Decent food  clean and very busy  Would recommend it  just get something cheaper ,neutral,2868589
Great food  great service  and well worth the drive if you dont live nearby The food was absolutely great  I had the bulgogi with the sides that accompanied it  While eating  we were offered free samples of some of the other great food simply to get a taste for it  Cant guarantee this happens every time to everyone  but I thought it was a great and friendly gesture!,positive,1485451
Overall  great place for heathier options  Ordered the Korean Spicy sauce with chicken in the regular size which came with choice of white or brown rice  I think there may be some other options besides rice  I chose brown rice  My husband had the honey seared shrimp with white rice  If you like spicy  the Korean sauce is the way to go  It is pretty spicy without killing your taste buds  There was some veggies in the dish but wish there was more  My husband has had the honey seared shrimp before and noted it was delicious but thought it had some kick to it before that it didnt have this time around  The unsweetened tea there was on point and my new favorite unsweetened tea ,positive,4160493
Had marvelous meal here with a great friend who is a Vegas local  They have the best yellowtail carpaccio I ever had and the grilled duck breast with foie gras is delicious! We also enjoyed the apple and beet salad and the beef cheek & bone marrow dumplings  We were sad they were out of the braised bone marrow dish  but I will becoming back to Vegas soon and will be back at Sparrow  Wolf (not like we need another reason other than just really amazing food)  The service was also superb  both servers helping us were very prompt and friendly  The server who took the food order really knew the dishes and made great recommendations  It was great a time to order a few dishes and share with a friend or two  The ambience of the restaurant is great  a nice chill vibe with eye catching decor  its a good thing to go off the Strip and venture out  you end up at places like this!,positive,1656462

La Banquise serves gourmet poutine in the sense that not only serves the tradional style with curds and gravy  They have at least 25 different variations but all the different variations are very downtoearth unlike the poutine that I once had in a fancy restaurant with lobster  brie and bernaise suace I tried the one called Mart poutine with smoked sausage  bacon and sauteed mushrooms as well as the curds and gravy  That was one delicious combination!This is definitely a place to try if you are in Montreal  The decor is very casual and funky    a great place to hangout with friends  Great place for lunch  snack  dinner  or after a night of partying ,positive,3387984
For an all you can eat buffet place  its pretty good and I wouldnt mind going back  When we first arrived and saw the parking lot  we thought it would be super busy (btw  we went on a Wednesday); however  when we went inside we were seated immediately  The parking lot is just chaotic  It took my boyfriend 15 minutes to find parking  The food choices were good and they had a hand shaved noodle which is not typical for a buffet place  It was very good  The service was pretty good as well  They were very good at clearing plates  Often  we would just finish our food and someone is already offering to take our plates  The sashimi was very fresh though for the salmon  they actually had someone stand there to hand it out because it was limited to 3 pcs each time  The place is large and the food was spread out with enough space to walk around Would definitely return  Much better than Mandarin and other places Ive tried ,positive,1251958
EXCEEDED EXPECTATIONS and beyond soothing  Ive only floated 3 times but Ive noticed after each float I feel 100x more MYSELF and who I truly am  I originally came to add additional healing to the chiropractic and physical therapy I was going through but I got so much more out of it  If youre like me and constantly struggle getting out of your head  then this is definitely worth the experience  Also  the staff is beyond genuine  Ive had the chance to conversate with about 4 of the staff members and each one of them made me feel right at home  Thanks guys!,positive,965194

Im a hot dog fan  This place has somewhat of a twist with adding the Korean flavor  The kimchi fries were kinda flavorless to me and so where the hot dogs  They werent bad by any means but Ive had better hot dogs  I def dont dislike this place so I think eventually Ill try it again and just order something different  This place has good potential and I hope to write a better review on it soon Friendly service,neutral,2900897
Party of 8  No outside drinks allowed in   prices were average on the strip    the tator tots   side of ranch and the strawberry lemonade were big disappointments   but everything else was great freshly made and our waiter was greatness    he even mentioned I would not like he ranch and brought out the signature sauce with it for me     we would for sure eat here on the strip again !!,positive,4178320
We did a 20 person birthday dinner and could not say enough good things about the service food embiance and price  Our waiter Michael was extremely attentive professional and courtious  He made sure everyones glass was full and communicated with everyone very comfortably  Everyone enjoyed their meal and had a great time  I have been to parties at the Portovino on the transcanada which was nice but this one is so much nicer  Thanks again to the Portovino staff and management for helping make for a great memorable birthday party ,positive,5984154

My sister and I went here for a quiet beer and something to snack on  What I didnt expect was the feeling of the place and all of the fun games that you could play with friends  The set up is really nice and relaxing while still feeling high end and I love the idea of having games to play  So fun!,positive,3810543
a hole in the wall to be sure but the poke bowl was super delicious! lots of poke for $10  we also had the bento with mochiko (sweet rice flour) battered fried chicken and the ahi  with rice and noodles  the ahi was soso but the chicken was good  the sweetness was unique but id probably try garlic next time  a lot of food for $8 and change  definitely stays on my list to try again ,positive,6554203
Really great service really nice and professional and knowledgeable will use again in the future and would recommend,positive,4311178
A friend introduced me to this place and this is a great alternative to the usual Chinese restaurants in the area  Their food isnt spectacular but this place is quite clean  I normally get the pork bone soup or dolsot bibimbap  I prefer the pork bone soup  Either the ingredients were cooked in the stone pot for long enough or it just lacked in taste but I wasnt very impressed by the bibimbap  However this place is usually pretty quiet and is normally frequented by students (most likely from U of T because of its proximity)  Overall  it is a good choice when you are in the area but if you had a choice  Id prefer other restaurants in koreantown ,neutral,87020
This chain restaurant is very expensive  3 beers  a shot and a PO boy was $29   To me  that is quite pricey ,negative,5171625
This is the 2nd time weve eaten here and both times were quite good  Its not nearby or wed go even more frequently! Prices are reasonable and there are a LOT of vegetarian options in addition to the standard (and not so standard) meat dishes  The spice scale is reasonable  a 5 has some heat but not light your mouth on fire  but they can get it nice & spicy if thats your taste  No one at our table had less than 5 so not sure how mild they can go for the nonspice lovers but they seemed very eager to accommodate  Service was very attentive  Plentiful parkDefinitely worth checking out!,positive,5328820
Love this place    but first time at this location isnt starting out too good  Walked in     manager said open seating feel free to sit anywhere  Nice  Sat down after about 7 mins my husband went to look for someone to serve us    found manager he apologized and went to find a server for us  After couple mins he came back and took our drink order  Then a server finally came  Took 24 mins to get our drinks!!!  Wonder how long our food will take ,negative,3534389
I use to see Sunny for a full set/fill  He always left a space on the top so they would look grown out a little but I never complained about it until it was pretty bad the other day  Three nails popped off and they looked 3 weeks old when I just got them done last week  I went back in to see if they would take care of me and just redo them but instead he didnt even speak to me and had someone else do it and then they recharged me for the fullset  Ive been a regular for 8 months now  so I thought that was pretty rude ,negative,2659425
A recent tip from a Facebook group to check out this new restaurant that opened last March inspired me to try it out tonight  I kept it simple and ordered 2 souvlaki pitas (pork and chicken) and a side of Greek potatoes for takeout  The price and the wait time were reasonable  Most importantly  the food was excellent and am very happy to have such quality fare so close to home! I look forward to returning and sampling more of their extensive menu in the restaurant Lastly  the staff was welcoming and courteous and the interior is very clean  modern and very well laid out  There is ample parking space  wheelchair access and an outdoor dining area  The owner should be commended for putting alot of thought into the design of this establishment ,positive,118208
The service was terrible on valentines day  The candle on our table was out I asked for it to be replaced   never happened  Took forever to get refills    I figured it was due to the amount of customers  Then walking out from the cold terrace about to leave I noticed everyone had bread and oil  We werent even offered the bread and oil that ticks me off  Lobster mac and cheese should just be Mac and cheese because the lobster was no where to be found  Asked for medium well steak   it was more medium rare  Not a fan ,negative,5006956
These poor employees have to deal with obnoxious immature snotnose ASU punks all day  every day   I have never walked in there and not seen some young a$$hole giving the staff a hard time or making a mess   It really sickens me to see how poorly kids are getting raised nowadays   I can say with certainty that if I had to work there  I would fucking kill one of these brats   Despite all this  the staff is always nice to me and genuinely cares if my order was made correctly   Today  the cashier helped me save a little money on my drink by telling me about their happier hour pricing   Thanks taco bell I want to hug every one of you ,positive,5103055
Sometimes you just gotta have a salad  And when that you is me  I often go to Jasons Deli Although their salad bar isnt as big as the one at Sweet Tomatoes  I like it nonetheless  Everything is fresh  and I like the crunch that their snack mix and wholegrain crackers provide  They also offer whole hardboiled eggs if you need a little protein boost  And if you have a sweet tooth  theres free softserve ice cream to boot Sure  you can always get a sandwich or some soup  But if youre in the mood for a quick salad and you dont want to fill your head with a lot of options  give the salad bar at Jasons Deli a try ,neutral,4552706
I came here on a Wednesday night and there was a steady stream of regular customers ordering to go and eating in  Upon walking in I was immediately greeted by Fernando  He was incredible! He walked me through the menu and let me taste a few of the items before I ordered  The menu had different types of bowls and plates with options for chicken  steak and falafel  Fernando recommended the falafel and the vegetarian sampler  I ended up ordering the vegetarian sampler platter with a side of chicken  Everything tasted delicious and fresh  The portions were also very generous  The big standouts to me were the hummus  the baba ganoosh  and the eggplant salad  Ill definitely be back for both the food and the customer service!,positive,1934142

I went to this starbucks earlier and ordered a pineapple tea infused lemonade and a mango dragonfruit refresher  i got a peach tea lemonade and a strawberry green tea instead  the guy red head at the window was very rude and acted like my service meant nothing  I think every time I visit this location I get horrible service and they always get my order wrong  Ive never had an experience at this location where they get my order right  or seem like they enjoy working there at all ,negative,2834093
I have one (ok two) words: CHOPPED SALAD  Some people like to sub the smoked salmon for chicken  but I prefer the original (smoked salmon)  It adds way more flavor  The textures and flavors in this salad are unlike anything youve ever tried  The nuts and dried corn make it crunchy  the cous cous makes it soft  the the currents make it sweet and salmon make it salty  the creamy (but light) cilantro salad dressing is SO refreshing I order this togo at least once a week  Order it unmixed  because its fun (and more fresh) to mix it yourself  Even if you dont eat all of it  the salad is just as good 24 hours later (unlike a lot of salads) If I had to eat one thing for the rest of my life    I could live off of this chopped salad  No joke  Ive honestly never ordered anything but the chopped salad because its SO good  so why would I?!,positive,2269990

First time I went here last month  I thought this place was okay  They gave me too much noodles in the soup that I was overwhelmed  Second time  I LOVE IT  My boyfriend got the Pho Tai (rare steak pho) and the broth was perfect  My grandma was impressed with how clear the broth was (listen to the old asian lady  they know what they are talking about when it comes to pho!)  I liked how it was not too salty but still flavorful I got the Bo Luc Lac Rice (shaken beef)  The beef was tender and they did not drown it in sauce like some places do  The lady  recommended steamed rice but I opted for their red rice (i think its tomatoes that makes it red   but I am not sure)  Next time  I will do the steamed rice  Thai tea was amazing! Some places  the thai tea is too sweet  I can still taste the tea at this place  Service was nice  I liked that they refilled my water so much  Great selection of food  Will be back ,positive,1147998
A strong 4 stars for the pizza (if you order a fresh new pie  as the slices for lunch specials looked like had been sitting 3045 minutes)   Anyway  the pizza I ordered was excellent   This place though loses a star for the customer service as well as the environment   Nobody comes up front  they have 1 cheese shaker for like 30 tables  there is food and crumbs on a lot of the tables in a mostly empty restaurant (only 2 tables used for customers)  the employees seemed to hang out in back most of the time rather than have anyone at all at the counter  and a few of the table clothes were ripped   Kind of a sloppy environment The pizza though  was excellent   I would get takeout from them for sure  but eating in the actual restaurant left a lot to be desired ,neutral,122549
So next month Mary Coyles is closing  Another Phoenix landmark is fading away  Like so many others  Legend City  Harkins movie theater (24th & Camelback) Toy Cottage and so many more  I wish my grandchildren had them to go too as I did  We slowly lose our identity of where we came from  Thank You Mary Coyle for always providing great ice cream  family centered fun and great service  You will be greatly missed!,positive,4514935
People  have a sense of humor! This place is great  Delicious food that was definitely unhealthy but hey  whats a vacation without going all out  The drinks were massive and quenching  Our waitress was a trip! Even though her goal was to be mean she was still attentive and a sweetheart  A great time definitely was had  Of course Ill return!,positive,4185432

After checking out a laser show  rainstorm  the fountains and almost all the stores at Miracle Mile  its time for tea We needed change and it had started raining outside   I like Coffee Beans Japanese Cherry and was amused to discover you can follow them on Twitter and Facebook   What could a coffee shop possibly have to say?  I was curious to find them and check it out but disappointed that my tea was made wrong   The water was poured boiled hot which scorched the tea bag making my tea bitter  I drank some of it anyway because it was getting really cold in Vegas and we had to leave the shops soon for our next adventure ,negative,185236
Best atmosphere in Chandler since El Zocalo  Have to wait for a table?  No problem  Bam!  $30 000 worth of exotic birds to look at  Some of the Amazon Parrots even speak (just dont for the love of God stick your finger inside their cadges ) Great service from bartender upstairs  as our friends slowly gathered  great service from the upstairs wait staff  Oyster shooters were ice cold  fresh and trustworthy  and not to be missed!  Once downstairs for dinner  we had prompt and even enthusiastic service from wait staff  They smoke all their meats  their kitchen is in full view from outside  This is a destination restaurant thats surely the envy of many in old town Scottsdale  Go!  Enjoy!,positive,514752
The new owners are doing an amazing job! The food is delicious and the customer service is excellent  Ive seen this restaurant go through a few owners and the current ones are amazing! I would highly recommend this place now! My favorite is the crispy lemon chicken!,positive,4935297
Face it  when in Vegas you will shell out the big bucks to eat a steakhouse  so why not go to the one with the best view!  I do have to warn  you might get a bit lightheaded but its definitely worth the food   I had a steak and it was amazing  I set the whole thing  probably shouldnt have  but in Vegas thats the only time I am allotted to do the shouldnt haves in life   Great service  great food  and great ambience!  BONUS TIP:  At the end of your meal you are granted free access to go to the viewing deck  DO IT!,positive,1081792
Disgusting the way they treat there patients! Just because these individuals are old does not mean they are senile  My grandmother was in there for three weeks and never saw a doctor or therapist until I had to speak up! Never again will she ever go to such an incompetent facility again mark my words  She had 20 days covered by her insurance and it seemed they were trying to use those up until she became had o become a cash patient  Wed never give them a cent!,negative,895895
Its been about a year since Ive been back  and this time overall meal was a bit of a letdown (went on a wednesday night)   Only sashimi we had was the salmon  which was pretty good for AYCE (im spoiled from the quality stuff from Taros in North York)    The rolls with the soft shell crab was good as well  while the rest of the rolls were just ok   Chicken teriyaki  pork cutlet were a bit dry  and udon was bland   The grilled scallops had way too much overly sweet mayo on it   The worse was the tempura shrimp  while the batter was fine  the shrimps themselves were soft and mushy and didnt taste fresh   At least my parents seemed happy with the place  although wed probably stick to the ala carte higher quality sushi places next time we crave Japanese ,neutral,3259126
We held our wedding rehearsal dinner at this restaurant  We worked with Ally to arrange the menu and Wade was our organizer that evening  They were fantastic  People raved about the food  service and the ambience  Highly recommend for a formal event  or just for fun ,positive,6052668
Cant speak to the quality of the paint job because they never bothered to show up for the estimate appointment  I left work early to meet them at our home and when no on showed I called the owner and he said he would call me right back  He never did  The next morning in received a text from the gentleman who was to do the estimate and he said he had our address wrong and forgot his phone  He asked for alternative times I provided those and he never responded  I get that trades are busy these days but if you dont have time just be honest and tell me that as opposed to wasting my time ,negative,705198

I got two tires changed at this location  Two weeks later one of these new tires went flat so I had to get it replaced  I didnt have to pay because of the warranty  A week later  the other new tire went flat  They wont pay for the tow truck  So I paid for their worthless tires that go flat  they dont send a tow truck  and theyre rude  Seriously  dont waste your time with these people or their crap tires  Julio  Jason  and Jeff were the three service guys that gave me two worthless tires  horrible service  and attitude  I went to the chandler location purely because its closer but Tempe Nissan will be my new location now  What a rip off ,negative,2096981
This is an old location   Hopefully with the recent announcements that KFC will be doing upgrades to their Canadian restaurants this will be one of them,neutral,5251656

I would recommend the rigatoni with fennel sausage  Delicious! Dont waste your $10 on the house green salad (unless you enjoy a plate of a variety of lettuce) bland! Also  the fettuccine with shrimp is pretty good  Light and shrimp is great quality ,neutral,2877896
I gave this place a chance since I love Target  & its nearby  Its a pretty place  They are overpriced and they are high pressure sales people  What they charge for arcrylics I can get gel elsewhere for same price  Then the guy kept asking me if I want gel  I said no & Ive had it before & no  Again he asked I said they dont lasts as long as arcrylic & I again he asked I said no & he asked again & I didn say anything  It seemed pretty after nails were done but upon closer look you can see where polish was applied too high & spots that werent filled  They went too fast  Wont be going back  Its not personable here ,neutral,2073013
I usually love this store  Ive been going for years  I sent one of friends in to purchase hair and she was taken advantage of  She was told that she was being hooked up  In reality after I looked at the receipt and product  she was charged for 4 packs of hair; twice  Basically she bought two packs of good quality hair and was charged for 8  The associate then used her friends discount for the transaction  So all of that for the points? Youve lost a loyal customer ,negative,2677047

I would leave no stars if I could  I visited Babalu for the first time recently for a Taco Tuesday lunch and was completely appalled by the service we received (or lack there of)  We waited over an hour for our food during a relatively slow lunch hour  Our appetizer  the queso  was horrendous   basically baked cheese covered in oil with a side of pita chips  After sitting in the restaurant for over an hour  we requested that our tacos be prepped to go  as we were on a workday lunch  That took another 1015 minutes  Might have been the worst dining experience Ive ever had in my entire life  All that said  our waitress was very gracious and considerate  Will not be going back  Ever ,negative,2870902
We enjoyed a late lunch on the outdoor patio during the first week of June 2010   The service was good  the food was excellent and the ambiance was nice   As other reviewers have noted  it does have a European feel   The salad with chicken livers was excellent as was the goat cheese salad ,neutral,5990915
I called at 5:58am  someone answered the phone  and dispatched a technician  He arrived about three hours later  Our technician was Jamison and he was great! When our garage door broke  our cars were trapped inside! Jamison arrived  explained what was wrong  explained our options for repair  and reviewed pricing for each option  He was kind  courteous  and very helpful  He lifted the door and propped it open so that we could get the cars out  then he completed the repair in a timely fashion  I like how he took the time to really explain things to us and answered all of our questions  I would definitely recommend this company  but I feel sorry for anyone who needs them  broken garage doors arent fun!,positive,1915281
Super cool bar!! Food is not your typical bar food  I ordered a medium rare burger with cottage cheese and it came out perfect!! My friend ordered a Cali burger with tots and he enjoyed it!! Staff was very helpful  we came in during shift change but Carrie took care of us  Live band on a Tuesday night  daily specials too  We will definitely be back ,positive,4644431

The location on Main St is now closed and moved to 63 N  Greenfield Rd  Ste 101MESA  AZ 85205 It is what it is  cheap pizza delivered   Its one of the few places that delivers to my address and for that they get the 3rd star and a 4th star because they are always quick and friendly   Im not comparing the pizza to good pizza  but when I have a taste for greasy and salty pizza  Papa Johns fills the need cheap and quick   What more could I ask?,positive,4920558

To me this is the ideal for getting your dance on   A free lounge with a live band that covers all the current top 40/hip hop dance tunes  you know the ones you hear on your car radio that make you want to boogie?  My only complaint is it seems like they group artists songs together   They did 3 or 4  of Fergies songs close together  same with JT   Minor nit pick   I would definitely return ,positive,5677077
Beautiful restaurant in the distillery district  Tried several dishes including the asparagus  lobster  frog legs  and escargot  Food was 4 stars all around  I like the vibe of the restaurant  Decor is great and the music perfect   Service was friendly  knowledgeable and attentive  All in all great dining experience  Do indulge!,positive,457045
Amazing place  Authentic Italian  Keep that in mind when talking to the owner  He is well  Italian! Had a very good and very fresh lunch sandwich one visit  On other visits the Gelato is amazinginginging      Made in house      Did I mention the Gelato is amazing??        I like private owned restaurants  This one is not fancy but it is definitely a local feel  Just what I wanted it to be ,positive,285695
The spa Mandalay is better than the bathhouse  here is why  The Bathhouse is stylish but cold  Nothing organic about it  where the spa mandalay is very inviting  The gym is fully stocked with great equipment and helpful service  The locker room is nice and clean  The showers and the steam room are very clean and the staff provides you with everything you need  All you have to do is ask  I would choose this over the bathhouse any day  The massuer was kind  She had a great touch and if things hurt  she would apply less pressure ,positive,5012973

Ive been here many times but Ive noticed that it has been getting slack with its quality and selection of pizzas  All I wanted is a veggie flatbread pizza which they usually have on deck  Not today  To get what you want you must custom order  Today apparently everyone had a order in a they actually ran out of numbers  I guess you get what you pay for so I shouldnt have too high expectations ,negative,3000451
The chilli chicken was good and up to the mark  The biryani Was properly spiced but a little less on the number of pieces in it and the masala  The take home option was a bit delayed as it took them almost 45 mins  They did treat us nice with a complementary mango lassi while the wait  Would recommend this place!,positive,4806768

Sorry but they are sexism  They have to give us an explanation for what we have done that they push me out  Ok we may be Asian but why? Ok just for one word  They are too strict for no reason  For you are asian  For you are lgbt  For you are not ladies in the sexy dress  If you wanna enjoy some night fun dancing in a good hiphop pub  Dont go for it cuz you can enjoy it if you are only ladies ,negative,4558428
Hotel is very outdated  MGM needs to put some money into this place  Prices were great for being on the strip  Food places are a little pricey  The bartenders Ive talked to have all been very rude  especially the ones working by the entrance for resort tower  Not as much going on as I was hoping in the actual hotel but I enjoyed the convenience of going to the Luxor and MGM easy ,negative,1784811
One of my favorite place for tart cravings  Specifically  their tart crust has a short bread texture and the filing quality has the right amount of sweetness and the flavors are prominent  My favorite tart flavors are matcha  molten cheese  and espresso  Either coffee or a Shirley Temple drink would go really well together  I would go back for more ,positive,4058098
Great location and atmosphere  wed visit again just for that   However  the reviewers commenting on the lack of true bbq flavor are on the right side of this argument   Thankfully they have good sauce to add on  because the inherent flavor of the pulled pork and brisket are nothing to write home about  The beans were delicious  while the chili was ok/good ,neutral,1512116

Sasa has to to one of my favorite restaurants here in the city  First  the atmosphere is exceptional and the whole place reminds me and my family of a really great New York City bar  If you are a fan of sushi  this is the place to go  For me  the salmon  Ika squid  and the Ebi shrimp are the best things on the menu  The portions are great and if you add in a specialty sushi rollScandinavian roll and White Spider Webare the favorites in our family  you have the perfect meal that is brimming with flavor and exploding with umami As for the service  it is impeccable and each server I have ever had is spot on with the menu and making sure you are taken care of in the most professional manner Additionally  the prices are not too pricey for such an exceptional meal If you like sushi and love an uptown atmosphere  this is the place to eat ,positive,4378564
If youre a vegan/vegetarian or would just like a healthier option then try the Urth Burger! Amazing  My friend ordered a virgin Capt N Crunch shake with Oreos on the side but they added the Oreos to the shake instead  Interesting yet still tasty concoction  Hence four out of five stars ,positive,3152908
Decent quick food for when youre on the go  The fries rock and the shakes are okay  A small step above fast food ,positive,829203
Decent pub food  and part of the Calgary Best Pubs chain  I think they are a chain as there are 5 or 6  irish pubs with different names but the same menus  Limericks Kilkeny  Dixons  Anyways  what does it for me with this place and why others seem to enjoy it is the staff are generally friendly and welcoming  Like a bar where everyone knows your name  Wing nights are decent (25 Cent mondays)  Wednesdays its a pound of wings for 6 50  and a bacon burger with fries for 6 50 (Can you get that at wendys across the street  with a beer order no less?),positive,829134

Went to Greenfield nails on Friday with my 5 yo daughter and had a great experience! I made an appointment online (through Yelp) and was contacted right away to confirm  The space was clean  big  bright and very comfortable  I got the basic pedicure and manicure and my daughter got a polish change on her hands and toes  All the people that were working were SO friendly and nice  Our services were very good  My manicure (regular  not gel) is still pristine  which I cant believe!! I had them painted Friday at 4pm and theyre still perfect Sunday at 6pm  We will definitely go back!,positive,6274889
We took both of our cars to Discount Tire in CO and always had a great experience so when one open in Ohio by our house we started going to them  Our experience at the Macedonia has been horrible  We have gone in more than one set of tires and each time it is a run around  This past week we took our car in because there was a screw in the tire and while repairing the tire they broke the tire pressure sensor  It took over a week to get the part in and now they dont remember what tire has the broken sensor  We not recommend anyone to this location for their incompetence ,negative,6115559
Curl  super curl with a feathery twist or the all natural  You name it  Cherry Lash has it!

Here is my outlook on the Trump International Hotel:PRO: Comfy ass bed complete with thick memory foam  Oh baby Kitchen in suite! That includes a stove and a fridge! Pretty snazzy Art books on the shelves to read and interesting art sculptures  CON: NO casino  The friends that I went with wanted to stay in a hotel without a casino because of the smoke  The hotel was cool because it didnt smell like cigs  but no casino? :[ I was a sad panda  What is this asian girl supposed to do when its 3am and you cant sleep? Le sigh!While there was a full kitchen  the toaster in our room was broken (RIP my poptart) Definitely a clean hotel and the service was great  The rooms were very spacious and well taken care of  While this is not usually my go to place when I go to vegas  it is not bad for the price  There is also a complimentary shuttle that takes you to Caesars Palace for shopping or Wynn for some gambling or clubbing ,positive,1730070

Usually we thoroughly enjoy our time at ChickfilA    but this one in Homestead  PA was another story altogether   Actually   it was hard to believe that this was actually a ChickfilA   The restaurant was extremely dirty   trash all over and under tables   open sauce packets (ketchup/mayo/nugget sauces  etc) all over serving areas   We were so tired from a long day of travel we actually stayed and ate   but we had to clean a table before we could use it   and we will NEVER go back to this location  Avoid at all cost ,negative,5788808

Wow  this little ole hotel is actually not too bad  After reading all the reviews here on yelp   I was expecting a notsogreat hotel/casino  I stayed one night in the newer suites and enjoyed It  Yeah  sure its not the best of the best  but still gets the job done if your looking for something simple  When I first initially checked in  the front desk guy seemed standoffish as I was trying to make a friendly convo with him but he didnt seem to reciprocate back so I just left it as is  The beds were comfy and seemed pretty clean  I really loved their glass elevator as it had a pretty view of Las Vegas ,neutral,6479174
This is a good little spot if you want to grab a quick lunch but pales in comparison to some of the other poke spots in town  While it is affordably priced  its likely due to the fact that you get pretty much as many sides as toppings as you want but an insignificant amount of protein  Also  the spicy mayo is a total let down ,neutral,5210332
Big Bang for your buck!!!! Especially for coffee  Never had any problems with any of the food with the exception of a large ham and a steak  Which is why I buy my meats elsewhere but the ham steaks and ground beef are the same as anywhere else  Great location!

I enjoyed my first experience here so much I decided to come back for seconds during my 5 day stay in Montreal  Being a beer lover  this place is fabulous  I highly recommend the Amber  and order a pitcher  The service is great  the staff is friendly and attentive  I would give a 5 star if only the food met my expectations  I ordered the goat cheese and sundried tomato pizza my first visit  it was o k  a bit dry and lacking flavour  On my second visit I ordered the trioofdip  which was FANTASTIC but it was only served with 6 small crostini slices which is far from enough to finish the appetizer  I did ask for more crostini but they came cold  stale and unlike the other ones from the original dish :( But thank you to our server Amanda for being so patient and kind  Overall  I would recommend this location for a night out with friends and the chance to try some new brews ,positive,2044751

I would give it a 3 5  Pros: Good food Decent menu selectionCons: Had to wait a while to even be greeted by someone at the door Prices were slightly high for the portion sizesNeutral: Although they forgot to bring out something I ordered  they apologized & comped that part of my meal  Good job on the save there  The atmosphere was loud  but only due to other customers (several groups of loudly cackling house wives)  I didnt try the coffee products  but they seem like theyre trying to serve gourmet coffee / espresso at those prices  but nobody knew anything about their beans & they have automated machines that make the coffee  not really hitting it home in that area Ill try it again  Im neutral at this point  Maybe next time theyll deliver better on the service side and itll get a bump up to 4 stars!,neutral,2863867
This is my favorite place to stay in Glendale  The rooms are nice and Aveda products  Pool table and indoor and outdoor seating area  The gym itself is amazing  The outdoor pool is warm and the jacuzzi is huge  The indoor pool is colder  Good place to stay for the AZ Cardinals home games  just walk out the door to the arena ,positive,5279188

Horrible service and definitely not worth the wait  Youre better off going to The Habit or Five Guys  Theres nothing special about these burgers when the wait is an hour long and the staff cant even acknowledge that the customers are in line  It took around 30 minutes for the staff to come out and attend the line  They were too busy prioritizing drive through ,negative,1773751
Fast  friendly and attentive wait staff  No MSG selections are awesome! I dont get thirsty afterwards so there really is no MSG (or very very very very little) for the no MSG selections  Their side dishes are surprisingly good (fried fish fillet) and overall great experience  Always busy so that should mean something  Will go back as I usually do ,positive,1104583
Life is really full of unfortunate  This place is a solid 4 5 star  I wouldve gave it a 5/5 since I cant put half a star on a review (my standard has be lowered when you have Waterloo food for 2 weeks straight  #hell)  The food was good  but one of our pasta was serve cold and it was just very upsetting  Although the manager was very kind and quickly made us a new one (when I say quick  it was like 2 minutes)  it just doesnt deserve that 0 5  (Hi manager  if you are reading this I know you know who I am  You did great)  The food was also very filling  I almost threw up cause I was that full  Give it a try  I cant guarantee if your food will be hot  Good Luck ,positive,3426843

Coffee bean    need I say more?! Though this location has service that is a little slower  there is a huge sitting area for people to study if they dont want to be in the library  A door connected to Book n Bean is a silent area/room so you can have the best of both worlds ,positive,751121
I wasnt thrilled the last time I was in here  Its a great location to pick something up on your way home  But I was confounded as to why they dont offer individual slices   It actually the first pizza place Ive ever been to that does that  Very weird if you ask me ,negative,2786458
As a third generation hillbilly once removed  I am always on the look out for good biscuits and gravy  Not dry heavy bread balls with bacon fat  but real b&g  Slap my Grandma and kiss my grits if these arent the best youve ever had! The biscuits are light and fluffy and the sausage gravy is perfect  You wont be sorry but you may need to lie down after you eat ,positive,346427
Youve seen the commercials with Melvin the dirty  clueless plumber  This is where he works! Dirty  dirty  and inconsiderate! If a guy named Skip comes to your door turn him away! Our bathroom showers were the problem and he spent the first 10 hours snaking every drain but them  On top of that  he tracked sewagesmelling mud all over the house and covered our bathrooms in it  When we asked about the mess he said a cleaning crew would come  The next day  a new plumber came out and told us that was completely false and Skip was supposed to clean up after himself  The second plumber was more knowledgeable but just as inconsiderate as he pulled our tub and dug into the foundation without once informing us that we should probably remove our belongings  I only gave them a two star because the last two plumbers (everyone other then Skip) were quite friendly  However  friendliness aside  I recommend you go elsewhere ,negative,6534922
Dr  Laris did an AMAZING job on my chin/neck liposuction lip and cheek filler  My appointment could not have gone any better  Him and his staff made me feel comfortable throughout the whole procedure  I have no doubt I chose the perfect place to get my procedure done  I would definitely recommend Phoenix Skin Dermatology they are by far the BEST! I I would definitely give more stars If I could!,positive,944471
Went here for breakfast one day when I had to be downtown after reading Misti Y s review of the place   The building architecture was definitely interesting and fun to look at  and the food was fine  nothing to exciting  but a fine breakfast   If youre looking for a deal  the breakfast special is probably the way to go   Also  dont let the name fool you  this isnt an Italian place  Im pretty sure its Argentinian   Either way  perfectly good place to go for breakfast when youre downtown ,neutral,6230131

Im not really a spa type person and were it not for YELP I probably would have never ended here  but am glad I did   $45 gets you access to the dry sauna  the steam room  the other steam room with a sink to shave in (its like shaving butter)  a hot tub jacuzzi and a separate jawdropping roman bath room with 3 mineral baths  one super warm  one super cold    and one just right    I spent about an hour in the just right one    There is also an arctic chill room with snow flakes falling from the ceiling  which feels pretty nice after cooking in a hot tub or sauna Great for detoxing  great for relaxing ,positive,2936387
These guys are fantastic  Probably one of the best magic shows on the strip  They are funny and will keep you guessing on how they do some of their fantastic trips  We have been to see several magic shows on the strip big and small and this by far beats a lot of them  They really engage the audience and it is family friendly ( with a few adult jokes  that go right over the kids heads)  We will definitely go back again and again  I hope this show hangs around for a while and continues to be successful  We had great seats and the guys were great at the end and we took pictures  got autographs  etc  Regardless if your group is looking for an adult night out  or you are looking for a night out with the family  this is one of the coolest shows I have been to on the strip  Go and enjoy  you will thank me later!,positive,5093462
Drinks way over priced!    BWW and Hooters captains are 3 dollars right now during the games  this place is $5 99    No wonder there is nobody here watching the games and the other places are full  I know times are tough  but good god    Do some market research and at least make an effort to compete ,negative,952923
I used to LOVE supporting ACCU   First  they got rid of Central Points and started charging overdraft fees   Overdraft fees are the reason I left major banks in the first place   Then  they RANDOMLY stopped accepting my online transfers from the Cash App or Wells Fargo Pay Anyone   It now takes two full days for a transfer that used to be instantaneous  because they refuse to upgrade and join the next century   And no one can tell me why   Save your time  pay the Big Banks even unethical as they are  they wont make your life unnecessarily difficult ,negative,2662548

This is my third time here and I can honestly say their service and food has been very consistent   While we were still in the parking lot the owner came out  greeted and opened the door for us  which was a very nice gesture   As for the food  I always get the chicken fried steak and it is always delicious   The batter is nice  crispy and adheres to the steak well   The meat is also very tender   The country style sausage gravy is creamy and has the perfect consistency with chunks of sausage    It definitely tastes better than most of other breakfast joints   My wife has tried their omelettes and they are always flavorful and fresh tasting   Their prices are also a little cheaper than other breakfast places which is another plus and with their $15 for $30 yelp deal you can not beat it   Will definitely be coming back here for breakfast ,positive,5295373
I think this was great  The price was okay and the location is perfect They redid their rooms and are still undergoing renovations  The rooms are re done but you can tell the place is aged oh well The staff was all friendly  The parking was easy  and the pool was fun I gave it an AOK because its a good place /location and Ive seen nicer  and worse places  There also was no mini fridge?!,neutral,2630408
Very nice place with some healthy options  Meals include a drink and a side  although if you get a large salad  you probably dont want a side salad  and their soup isnt vegetarian  so chips it is ,positive,5846901

Whenever you are in Las Vegas this is one place you must eat!!!  The food is awesome very affordable and the people who make up the atmosphere are the most hospitable  kind and service oriented individuals in the world!  So  if you want to have a wonderful experience in Las Vegas go right to this lovely and casual establishment   I know they will always see me when I visit   You must eat the mouth watering biscuits and the awesome homemade lemonade   Not to speak of the watermelon chunks with mint just to ask for more   Loved every moment I was there   See you real soon!!!,positive,6370848

This Taco Bell was the closest to my work  which is why I came here and I will not be coming back  The cinnamon twists I ordered I had no cinnamon on them  They were literally all white and tasteless  I was only given 8 twists  which is just about half full of the bag they serve them in  My bean burrito was full of beans  which is nice  Some locations barely put any  However  there was a hair in it  Customer service was good  but the quality and portion of food was not ,negative,5160202
We discovered this gem last night  Mediterranean food is my favorite cuisine in the world  I have been fortunate enough to visit Turkey for almost a month and while there  I never had any food that was not superb  Anxious to try this after reading good reviews  we were not disappointed  I had the chicken shawarma plate while my husband had the gyro plate  I also had a bowl of their lentil soup   Everything we were served was incredible  I particularly loved their tabouli and the lentil soup   Both meats were prepared beautifully and the rice had a lovely subtle flavor   I have never really liked baklava but their version was magnificent  I realize I have used many superlative adjectives but thats how good this place proved to be  If you love really good quality  well prepared food with a Mediterranean flavor  you will love this place ,positive,5987137
Great service by Savannah   Delightful tapas  Enjoyed everything we tried  Ambience was awesome   Only downside was musty smell which bothered our allergies   We plan to go back though because the food was great:  Poke stuffed avocados  veggie flat bread  oyster sliders ever so lightly breaded  lightly breaded deviled eggs  very spicy chicken and waffles  pork nachos and pork tacos ,positive,1573473

Went to The Venue Bistro 8/20/2015 for a business dinner   Group sat outside on the beautiful patio area   Food was very good  Group shared Sausage & Ricotta flatbread  stuffed Prosciutto Rolls  and Stuffed Portabellos before entre   All were very good   The service team at The Vendur Bistro was excellent Checking on the table at the right moments   Only thing that I would hope tey work on is the music sound system a bit loud and had to talk loud to hear each other when the act was playing ,positive,6278458

Ok so my partner surprised me with a promise ring  It was beautiful and so me  sadly was not the best fit  Me and my partner went back to get it resized  The staff there was very helpful and accommodating  They even brought me over to check out the others to make sure it was the perfect ring for me  They also resized me on the spot so I know my size Sadly the ring I wanted wasnt in my size so they custom ordered it with free shipping g and they will call me in 2 weeks or less when it arrives  All and all a good experience  They werent trying to upsell or force me to get something I didnt want because if price  I will be back for sure with any other jewelry need I may have :),positive,4009900
So you get to Vegas and you are all like OMG OMG VEGAS OMG WHERE CAN I SPEND MY MONEY LIKE A FOOL? Then  of course you come to a realization that he slot machines in the airport suck and you have to get to the strip? Who is there to give you a ride? Your choices are to walk (20 mins)  or take a ride  If you take a ride you have taxis  shuttles and limos  Taxis are overpriced for such a short ride (even to fremont st )  Limos are only for ballers  If you are looking for a review of a shuttle service on Yelp  you might not be a baller  Lastly  you have different shuttle services who let you cruise the streets of vegas with a bunch or total strangers  Good stuff  Anyway  once you get your bag from baggage claim and get outside into the dry heat (mmmmm heat!)  you will be presented by a few shuttle services  The closest one to the door is the most expensive  Drag your coke drinking  HFCS consuming butt right down to Nevada Coaches  Give them 9 bucks and enjoy the ride ,positive,4528726
Dr  Dossett was very good  I had no problems with her services  Problem is  this office changes personnel every 2 months  They constantly up sell you on procedures that other dentists explain as not really necessary  The whole billing department is terrible    never get a straight answer  and be doubly sure your insurance will cover a procedure and GET IT IN WRITING  Professional dentist  but terrible front office and very pushy sales techniques ,negative,940848

my dad used to speak of this place as his high school hangout place  and that hed drive some distance intentionally just to come here  at last  ive had the chance to try the ice cream here myself  and it did not disappoint  their portions are really generous  and their ice creams are not overpriced  the espresso is by far my favorite flavor there  they have many fancy waffle cones  but my favorite is still just the plain one  its crunchy and delicious  the banana split was also quite good  yet another example of the huge portions there  the store decor is also so cute! definitely worth going again ,positive,6612196

Hurry up and open Distill!!! I used to love the place  (see previous reviews) but they are starting to get weird with the regs  we used to play and play  be served drinks and served some more drinks  suddenly today we get Sh***y attitude from our ex fave bar tender and told we have to now pay for cognac  Meanwhile others at the bar yapping all afternoon served with no problem   we play at least 100  and are told we now have to pay $10 00 per shot? when did that crap start? oh its been always  nope! we used to be comped food and drinks and now they are becoming Timbers  ok  well if I put $20 in the machine multiple times give me two shots a pop  they are starting to suck service wise and Ill lose my money elsewhere because the machines suck as well!,negative,1798903
Oxtail empanada tastes good but has very small portion  For the given price  it is not woth getting  We also got porkchop which was slightly overcooked although it came with great mash potatos mixed with mustard  Their classic red sangria is also very good ,neutral,4167666

Please dont use this store  Terrible customer service  No attention to detail  I have never posted a comment on any site before  but this one warrants it  My mother used their services to pack and ship a delicate item  It was thrown in an empty box with no packing material  There were continuing issues with the claim check (as my mother had taken out insurance on this item) and Peggy quite literally does not care about customer service ,negative,4216875
The idea is greatI love to see Catholic Churches transformed into breweries  The service was slow and mediocre  The food was terrible  The beer was potable at best  They need to reevaluate their model ,negative,4910217
This little Taqueria is amazingly good! The owner Alboro has a passion for excellence  Everything that comes out of the kitchen  made by one of his 3 beautiful cooks  is looked over by him and does not hit your table unless its perfect  I fully recommend paying the dollar to get into the Fantastik Swap meet just to get into this place for food  If your already going to the swap meet check out Tias you wont be disappointed its quality Mex grub for sure  The Mexican Corn is probably the most popular dish ,positive,5365544
Stopped in and had lunch here  I have eaten at one in the Bahamas before  The atmosphere is hard to beat  The portions are big enough for 34 people easy  as its family style  We ordered chicken parmigiana and portobello parmigiana  Both were fine only thing that prevents the fifth star is that you had to pay an extra 12 dollars for noodles with the chicken parmigiana   I would eat here again ,positive,4609235
Came across Atwood via friend referral  and I was not disappointed  Mercedes G Wagon has a high repair cost  however Andy and his team were not only surprisingly reasonable  they did a great job it drives like new!

I LOVE WAFFLE CRUSH! Whenever theyre on the west side of the valley (about once a week  theyre mainly in the Gilbert/Chandler area) I always have to grab a gluten free waffle! The employees in the truck are so sweet and fun and always present an Instagramworthy waffle! The gluten free waffle can be a little dry  but 1 ) thats to be expected from a lot gluten free things  so I you cant complain  and 2 ) its nothing a heaping serving of strawberries  a layer of Nutella  and a giant scoop of whipped cream cant fix  Stop by the truck and get yourself a liege waffle!,positive,1806902
I wish they were open later!!!  Granted I shouldnt be eating so late in the first place to anger my stupid acid reflux  but as an industry person in Las Vegas  you sometimes just want late night ramen after a stressful shift  Am I right or am I right??      Now back to business     LOVE this place!! Hands down the most beautifully flavored Tonkatsu broth in town in my humble opinion  That along with the fantastic service by the friendly wait staff makes it just that more perfect  For you gym rats on a carb loading day  have a small bowl of their curry rice with your ramen bowl and you  are   set!! Oh and the Chasu pork on that ramen? Packs a delicious delicate flavor thats truly accentuated by that amazing broth   I could eat ramen everyday and I might have just found my new obsession   ,positive,2853525
Went back for round II! Got the Oolong macaron again along with a passionfruit chocolate  WOW the flavours are really good here  And when you bite into the macaron   NO air pockets! Very pleased Got the Mont Blanc which my parents LOVED (they are big chestnut fans!)Also got the LEMON TART ($4): is very tart and refreshing in comparison to all the other desserts  but that is why we absolutely love it  The balance of shortbread to lemon curd is perfect  The presentation is nothing too fancy like the Mont Blanc or Pistache  but dont let the looks discourage you from trying this delicious treat!  And lastly  got the PISTACHE ($7)  The shortbread crust adds a great crunchy texture to the light pistachio filling inside  This dessert has a light pistachio cream which is not too overwhelming and topped with raspberries to give it that fruity kick  If you are looking for something that is not as sweet as the popular Mont Blanc  the Pistache is a great option ,positive,6213702
We went and saw this show on a Tuesday and they had 241 tickets for VIP! (google that stuff)  We were right next to the stage and this show was great! Coco is very pretty and the dancing is spectacular  The guys in the show do a real good job keeping your interest   It is amazing what a pair of tight theighs can do    OHH Sorry   Let me talk about the show again  LOL I would highly recommend it  They did make me coat check my Popcorn that I had bought in the mall   I was hoping one of my guys were picked to go on stage but maybe next time  This was tasteful and calssy great couples night out   Makes you want to be Little bo Peep~,positive,6133218
Tofu Hut is just one of those amazing value places that stick in your head every time youre deciding what to eat  There are a ton of Korea BBQ places in Vegas   but Tofu Hut has the combination of price and quality that is almost confounding Expect a wait no matter the time of day  They stop seating at 1am  but I would not show up later than 12:30 because if the line gets too long  they will close the sign up sheet  I still dont get why its called Tofu Hut  but youre going for AYCE Korean BBQ option  and even though the price is cheaper for late night  Id still get the kalbi which is a little more because the quality of the short ribs is excellent  Other favorites were the marinated sliced pork  marinated sliced ribeye  and boneless chicken thighs The only knock on this place is service  but the quality/quantity of food makes this place a mainstay in our list of late night cravings  For less than 20 dollars including tax/tip    just go ,positive,5688378
One of my favourite small deal places to go in charlotte  They have what seems like a endless variety of fun little snacky food that appeals to people who are just looking to lounge around and  on occasion  listen to some live music  The acts they are pulling in are mostly local people who would rank at best open mic level of performance but as long as you dont go with super high expectations you will have a good time  They also have a good beer selection and if you are looking to drink cheap the domestics are reasonably priced  I have only eaten there a couple times but the food I would say is mid grade and priced reasonably  They do have free beer and wine tasting which will give you the chance to sample some different brands at times ,positive,4063757

My little brother and I checked it out    Nice place to sit on the patio and drink some Turkish coffee (ugh so good)  Im a vegetarian so I got the falafel wrap which I give a 3 5    I have had yummier falafel elsewhere  but the gyro my brother got smelled awesome and he loved it  I sense that the lamb here is its main selling point  The atmosphere was very sweet  seems very family owned and operated ,positive,3787376
While what I ordered was pretty tasty  I think Im just irritated overall  The menu had a broad selection  I chose a special  Alaskan Halibut  At $38  I figured there would be a nonmenu side salad I could get as an accompaniment or to trade what the special came with for a salad  I only could select from the menu salads which was $8 minimum  Like I said  the food was good  I just expected to have been given more options for what I paid ,neutral,6388385
the patio is really great in the summer  I dont have a reason for going here in winter though  I ordered some jerk chicken thing  and pieces of rubber were in it  the server apologized and took it off the menu  other than the pieces of nasty plastic  the chicken was meh   then I saw a drunk man stumble out of the restaurant and get in his car and whip down queen street   what a delightful meal ,negative,6637575

For lack of a better term  secret pizza a hidden gem  the line to grab a pizza was a long one but it was well worth the wait  the only problem that was with the pizza place was the prices were a little expensive but not too bad  I had the supreme pizza and slice was huge  I will definitely be going back to enjoy another pizza,positive,1254237

Kinda has that kitchen nightmares vibe  Dining room was huuuge and the place was nearly deserted  I honestly dont know how places in Vegas can survive when not backed by a big name chef  They must pay a fortune in rent for the size of this space; doubt they are making money  We had 30 minutes for breakfast before our conference which is why we ducked in  Server told us not to order the shrimp and grits breakfast  Just silently shook her head no and then said I like for people to order things I wont have to take back  Believe me  we appreciated that from the server  But yeah  Kitchen nightmares  I had the huevos rancheros and it was good  Just not Vegas good  You expect so much more from the food scene in this town  This dish was basic  My buddy had the smores pancakes and did not complain  Not worth it when there are amazing restaurants all over the place  Will probably be closed by the time you go to Vegas ,negative,3373488
Phoenix Sky harbor Airport is a very busy place on most days  Terminal 4 is the one i use the most  It is organized and laid out well  If you read and follow the signs you will find your way around very easily  There are the people in Purple outfits that can answer your questions if you have any  It is a perfect grid with moving sidewalks so  you wont get lost and you get through quickly  Always give your self at least 2 hours before your flight because  sometimes security lines can be very long   Not too much choice in restaurants very high priced  Plus a few nice shops to buy this and that  They even have a drug store now but be prepared to pay double  Parking in the garage is very high  So you want to park off site and take the shuttle in  Unless you dont care about spending  All in all a pretty nice airport ,positive,4197085
Great real BBQ! Recently moved here from Detroit & was having a hard time finding a good BBQ place  This place is it  The owners are from Memphis & boy can you tell  I had the 1/2 chicken with mac & cheese while my boyfriend had the beef ribs & fries  We both got very generous portions & the leftovers were just as good  Found our new go to BBQ spot ,positive,1560534

What a beautiful place to have dinner  The fountain view is not to be beat  The service was over the top  The food delicious  I am gluten free and they had a special menu  I was there with a party of nine people   The side dishes are shareable and every dish that was presented at the table the waiter leaned over and told me if it was a safe dish for me to eat  It is extremely pricey restaurant but was well worth it ,positive,6296184
Im a big Fan of Lowes Foods  I have to admit one of the biggest reasons I love it so much is they have the best     Pistachio Muffins ever made !!! Its the only place in town I know that has this particular type of Huge Green Pistachio Muffin with an awesome sugar topping   Sadly all the stores by where I live closed down and the only one left is in Harrisburg North Carolina that I know of   So I guess I will be looking for cupcake and muffin bakeries next to find a replacement  Anyway as far as a grocery store they always have fresh produce decent prices if look for the sales just like anywhere else  and The deli and bakery are always spot on !,positive,2896534
chloe waited on me  & was very rude  She acted as if she didnt want to be there and didnt have a great attitude toward me AT ALL     it was my first time being at this location  and i will not be returning  ALSO  all the food tasted quite different from other pandas  It was odd    i got orange chicken  tasted like sh*t  and i ordered angus steak  Tasted NOTHING like the angus steak  and didnt even look like it  Tell me what u think    ,negative,6611
I found The Attic on Taphunter while in Phoenix on business   and what a find!

We went here for dinner this week in Vegas   The restaurant is beautiful  definitely what you would expect from A nice restaurant in the Metropolitan The decor was stunning  the DJ was awesome  the service was shop  but the food was severely lacking We ordered salads for appetizers (ceaser & wedge)    both had wilted lettuce and pretty boring taste   Not to mention they were about $25 each The menu is a la cart  so we ordered filet ($60)  chicken ($39)  and a side of asparagus ($15)   The entrees were just ok  certainly not what youd expect for that price point and the asparagus tastes like tree bark All glitz  no substance!,negative,6138686
We have tried to keep giving the location more opportunities to improve their service since they opened     They are always out of things that we order  the staff for the most part are miserable  the orders are incorrect half the time     Very disappointed since I generally love DD ,negative,6050033
Late lunch the day after Christmas  Ordered ala carte soft chix taco  beef enchilada & refried beans  Decent but not flavorful enough  The queso blanco cheese is very salty so if you serve it without vegetables or salsa or something to cut it  it tends to overpower the dishes   The liberal use of queso blanco is reminiscent of El Campesino   GF ordered fajita chix salad w extra guac  Again  decent but a little bland  Guac was limey and flavorful   Free basket of chips/salsa was very good too  Service was really good  Ladies room was one of most disgusting Ive seen in a restaurant  They need to clean really well  including the walls & fix toilet leaks GROSS!,neutral,3401567

When I got home from Vegas  I immediately searched the internet and viewed every clip and YouTube video I could find   Check out the videos of Terry when he performed with TEXAS the Band  in his earlier days   Long hair  great vocals & ventriloquism    His book  Whos The Dummy Now is a great read and really gives you insight into all the blood  sweat and tears he put into perfecting his talent   Its truly inspirational  I wish him all the luck and admiration he deserves!,positive,2585645

I have been a regular at this location for the past 3 years and would give it 5 stars   However  I had one bad haircut last December that I am still trying to outgrow   I asked for layers in the bottom inch of my hair and ended up getting layers 4 inches higher  does not look good on someone with thick natural wavy hair   Lucky for me  I have had several excellent stylists cut my hair since then and I have about 2 more visits to go before my hair is back to normal and the layers are where they should be   My only request is that they change the opening hours to 8 or 8:30 am  I live and work nearby and prefer to go in the morning when there is less of a wait ,positive,2190236
Place is geared for anklebiters but can be really funif you had 5 or more mixed drinks  Shooting zombies  racing cars  shooting soldiers  shooting monsters  allthat fun arcade stuff  And you also get tickets towin overstuffed animals or just put it back as creditto your Dave and Busters card  Theres a cool bar up on the 2nd floor that overlooks the mall if youget tired of all the arcade mayhem  Probably worth acouple of hours of solid fun or until a member of yourgroup gets booted from the premises for trying to smoke in the bathroom  Whichever comes first   ,positive,4208157
BEST VEGGIE BURGER Ive had yet!  It had the taste of a traditional meat burger  the texture and grill flavor  and is offered several different ways   The bun isnt gluten free for those wondering but you can make it a wrap or on a salad   We opted for the sweet potato fries instead of the side salad  fries were seasoned and not overly done    The hummus bowl was another hit   A good creamy texture  not overly dry  served with pita bread and veggies for dipping and topped with sesame seeds ,positive,427722
RECOMMEND:  ARRIVE 30 MINUTES EARLY!  Seating arrangements is firstcome firstserved basis (despite reservations)   Meaning  if you arrive within the last 15 minutes  chances are you will be sitting in the back   Theres a bar as well as kitchen so come early and snack/drink there while waiting   FOOD: 5/5I cant really remember what i ordered but i do remember the food being decent   I cant comment on anything more DECOR/AMBIANCE: 5/5Its a lavish casino restaurant  why would it be anything less?COMEDY: 5/5If you go on a night with a reknown comedian you will have a great time   Even if not  most of their openers if not all are very funny so you can be sure you will have a good time   Great little spot to bring your date ,positive,4281767
The service was great  dont get me wrong However  I was really disappointed with the food  we ordered the Caprese and a Margarita with mushrooms  The Caprese came out first and the tomatoes and mozzarella were really poor quality  Its not like I dont realize tomatoes are out of season but they could really do better than that  The mozzarella was just bad over all  the texture and taste  Seeing as how bad the mozzarella was  I had our waiter change the cheese on our pizza to the buffalo mozzarella which was like 3$ more just to hope it would turn out better  Our pizza arrived  I expected the buffalo mozzarella to be a bit more watery  but our pizza was literally flooded with the water from the buffalo mozzarella and was a nightmare I dont drive all the way out to Phoenix often  and I usually just do it to go to nice restaurants I find on Yelp  Such as Bianco  Matts  and Atoyac; and I always seem to have a good time and experiance at all of these but this place let me down ,neutral,5004701

Whoa So silly me  I assumed that this workout would be easy  Like you know  swing around in hammocks and do a couple ballet moves  No sweat  Right? Ha Im still sore from this workout  This class was for beginners and thankfully a lot of newbies like me were in the class  Air Foundation teaches you some of the basics of getting comfortable with the hammock (which is the first battle)  I wont lie I struggled to let go and fly but once I got more comfortable it really worked out my core  Youre using muscles you dont even know you have! Really fun class! Everyone was super welcoming and friendly too! Id definitely recommend giving it a try!,positive,6392867
I love go carts and this IS the best  I came with my daughters 17 and 14   We went in a week night   Not crowded  Cars are electric so no fumes   Staff keeps it a controlled environment   A few snacks there so nothing special   And the have a segregated room for an office party if needed   Great safety equipment   Price kept me from rating 5 stars ,positive,2397197
These people did a beautiful job in my garage   I expect it to hold up for years   They filled the deep  widecracks in the concrete and sanded off the old paint which took some time and machinery   Two car garage with big prep job around $1400 and it looks amazing and I think will increase the value of our house by at least that much ,positive,5102364
If you are looking to enjoy nightlife in Vegas  there is no other way to do it except by getting a host  Enter Lance Sherman  the most down to earth  straight forward  and nicest guy I met through a recommendation from my casino host  Ive never been to Vegas before  so I solely relied on his decisions of what clubs to go to  and he killed it every time! We used him 3 nights in a row  him being out of town for one  so he sent his partner Cheech  another stand up guy  Cutting nearly every line to get in was well worth the price alone  the lines looked longer than an amusement ride in Disney  Ill be coming back within a year  and you can bet Ill be using Lances services again! Thanks again Lance!!,positive,3124511
very nice accommodations  while it is off the strip  its close to the hot spots (XS  Tao) and very very convenient  cab ride is no more than $10  love the two bathrooms! perfect when rooming with girls  also liked that it was easy in/out  no getting lost with multiple entrances  quite a roomy and affordable hotel with a high level of service ,positive,6653044
We ordered the Stir Fried Pork Bulgogi with Vegetables on Rice  and the Stir Fried Rice with Kimchi and Chicken  Both came to around $23  which was an excellent deal because the dishes were massive and we were super full by the end of it  The pork was tender and full of flavour  Even though Im not a fan of onions in particular  the sauce was so tasty I didnt really care! They dont skimp on the meat portions either  As for the kimchi fried rice   it had a nice kick  but there wasnt a lot of chicken  This is definitely a good dish for sharing (along with another main or two)  Overall  really glad we stopped by here for lunch  Service was prompt and friendly  food was excellent  and its worth revisiting for sure!,positive,6086119

Dr  Loud and her staff are quite amazing and so helpful!

I went there last week  Saw a BMW that really caught my eye  I had called the dealership maybe a week and a half before I had time to come I to the dealership  When I got there I was so excited to test drive the car and possibly take it home  At this point the car was advertised for about 3 weeks now  So when I got there they told me that if I bought the car I wouldnt be able to drive it off the lot because its not ready to be delivered  I said ok fine  but why is it advertised  At this point I was already frustrated  they run my credit then they come back and tell me that the BMW is not up for sale because it he a bad transmission  WHY WAS IT EVEN ADVERTISED!!! thanks for wasting my time!,negative,2813996
The cassata cake and the cannoli are amazing!!

Ditto many of the reviews here    we were approached by a promoter by the hotel lobby and he seemed so nice so we decided to try Jewel for our final night in Vegas! Probably the worst decision of my Vegas life  and weve all made dumb decisions here  But no worries  the best decision also is made later  By the time we showed up  an hour after he told us we had to be there since no one starts waiting at 925pm  there was a line of maybe 2030 folks  So we get ours IDs checked and guestlist nods  we wait  And then we wait some more  Its 120am and I text the promoter wtf  he says 4 minutes the doors will open  20 minutes later I text again and he said the private event is about to let out and that were fine  I did not go to Vegas to stand in a dumb line for 2 hours so we left  Probably the best decision I ever made    went next door  got in within 20 minutes and we danced until we needed to eat steak and eggs  The end ,negative,897363

Best sushi in the area   Went here the weekend after Thanksgiving with my parents  who have been regulars since they opened   We are from Philly  and BigEye is on par with the best sushi in Philly   Pop had the sashimi deluxe combo  which had a phenomenal assortment of fresh cuts of fish in a nice presentation   The white tuna was incredibly fresh and buttery  We ordered a bunch of rolls for the table  including the Mustard Roll  Dragon roll  and various spicy rolls    The Mustard Roll was fantastic (my new fave there)  as was the Dragon Roll   The various spicy rolls were decent   Finished dinner off with the mango ice cream  which was creamy but not too rich   a nice palette cleanser   Kim and Barry  the owners  are very welcoming and friendly   Would go back in a heartbeat ,positive,554157

The food included a turkey burger that had a blackened bottom from being burnt  even though I was charged for an extra side I was never given it  The entire time we were there we never got utensils to eat with and our table had two empty ketchup bottles  Our waitress only came to take our order once then when we had to flag her down after 1015 minutes of not seeing her at all even though it wasnt even busy  She never refilled our drinks  Our kids were crying and fussy after we waited around 3045 minutes to get our food  Spare yourself  the only memorable part of this dining experience was that it was probably the worst food and service I have ever gotten at any restaurant  This is the only negative review I have ever written and I am pretty forgiving but this was bad ,negative,4850819

Canceled my reservation   Went thru Amex Travel   Said it was a Jaguar XJ or similar   Thought it was wise to check YELP   Bingo  called up Sixt at the Las Vegas Airport and when they verified my reservation  they said the car was a Dodge Charger (6 cylinder)! So the AD in AMEX for Sixt is a BOLD FACE LIE   Checked with payless on Amex for a Premium car   for $98 instead of $142  I can rent a Dodge Charger! Same car for $44 less   Read the reviews 2 stars and below  this Rental Car place should have a 1/2 star   The 5 stars are most likely stock holders or executive staff at Sixt  just saying ,negative,705900

Not really that good for all the hype this place is getting   First off   the chairs are cheap and very uncomfortable   The cocktails were good but nothing to brag about  The draft beer handles just dont belong at a place like that either  The one black bartender was nice   but the two white bartenders were very hesitant   Its too rustic and you feel like your in a dungeon   Didnt really care for the religious stain glass windows either   Not a well thought out cocktail bar   I wish the spotted owl the best   but I wont be back  ,negative,3941007

Decent selection of food  The draw is the crepe station  Was expecting a foodcrepe station (i e  non dessert crepes)  but it was just dessert crepes  The egg station was good too  Actually  I didnt end up eating crepes or eggs because I ate some other things first and then was full The pastries seemed like the typical buffet pastries  little things on plates  The creme brulee was gross  The soft serve ice cream machine was fun and the ice cream cones were the good sugarcone type The eggs benedict was ok  but Ive tasted better hollandaise sauce Maybe my buffet bar was raised because I had just eatten at the Bellagio buffet    but Le Village Buffet was ok ,neutral,829486

Playful  clever   brilliantExpected more theatrical gastronomic fireworks   but this was very refined and focused Think of this place as dinner and a show   if you appreciate refined  creative  and brilliant food   this place is a must see That said   now that Ive done it  I have no interest in going back and   I cant say that about The French Laundry because    at the risk of sounding horribly pretentious  when I ate at the French Laundry  I knew I was doing something special   I knew I was eating at the best restaurant in the world and seeing what those chefs did changed my perception of what food could be This is cool   but its just a branch of minibar ,positive,4213823
We just moved to Southern Highlands and so happy to find this neighborhood place!  This place has fabulous service and amazing food! What most impressed me was how fast the waiter came to the table to offer us a drink   We had our kids and my daughter kept spilling stuff and they were on top of everything   I spilled the entire pepper on my garbage salad  which was delicious  and they asked if I wanted a new one and I truly didnt and knew it was my fault so didnt want to hassle   After saying no they still brought another full salad out   Great artichoke appetizerS! Great happy hour prices too! Cant wait to go back ,positive,6058213

I think Ive found a new place to get my boba fix and to bring friends  Im looking forward to getting to come back to this spot soon (especially because I cant wait to try more drinks off the menu) This time  I ordered the peach tea with honey boba  The tea itself was sweet without sweetener added and I loved the floral flavor of it  I also got to try the cantaloupe tea  which I am definitely going to get on a future trip  The boba were perfectly chewy and I got a perfect amount of boba in my tea  On the menu I also noticed egg pudding as an add in  which Im hoping to try on a future visit in a thicker drink  Overall Im looking forward to coming back here  I loved the boba and its on my way to and from most of the places I go  which is a great excuse to stop in ,positive,2623106

Professional service and staff who actually want to help make you feel better  What I mean  is they will try to explain what might be happening  recommend stretches and even give referrals to other things that might be helpful  This is a no frills place  its not like going to a spa  You may hear the streetcar below and you need to trek up a flight of stairs  So in that respect I gave it four stars  I know therapeutic massages do not need to be a super elegant place  but its a nice added bonus when your paying to get a massage  It is clean though  On the other side  the work they do  ease of making appointments  and location make this a great place to go to see a RMT  I hear the owner however is only available during the day  during the week  which is too bad  I heard shes good with TCM ,positive,4260036
Popular with students from UNLV since it is very close to campus  so obviously catering to that population  This establishment serves healthy acai bowls  juices  and poke bowls Acari bowls here were nothing special  I have tried a few of the acai bowls  the Ocean and PB lover to name some  and nothing really stood out  The acai bowls were very watered down and bland  I also expected a lot more acai/pitaya  Most of my bowls were packed with granola  Not to mention that there is not much consistency and I finished my acai bowls very disappointed Service is lacking  as well  Employees did not seem like they wanted to be there at all and were quite rude to me and many customers I witnessed ordering  Very big turn off Will maybe come back to give this place another shot if I am in the area  Maybe I will try a poke bowl  Hopefully by then their customer service and food quality would have gone up ,negative,4225795

Horrible experience with Urban Nest   Since we dont live near the property  we trusted them with our home while on the market for sale   They insisted on  new painting and carpet  which it did need   But then hired non professional  non insured or licensed people to do the job!  They also wanted to do repairs in the home    When we showed up unexpectantly  we found the repairs were not done!  We  of course  were charged for these repairs   The paint and carpet were done very badly  along with the cleaning and landscaping which we paid for but have a feeling was also not done   Needless to say  after all the lies and charges we fired them   They then proceeded to yell at us and tell us it was all our fault   Should have their license taken away    BEWARE!,negative,1769308

Ive never met a physician who is as thorough  caring and competent as Dr  Metzger   She takes time to really explore the root causes of your medical issues   When you are being examined by Dr  Metzger  she takes her time and truly focuses on YOU; unlike many other physicians where you can tell how busy they are and how eager they are to move on to their next patient   Not so with Dr  Metzger   I would trust her with my life (which is a good thing  since  well  you know  she is a physician)   She also explains things in terms you can understand and provides commonsense solutions to improve your conditions After using Dr  Metzger for years (and being impressed every time I was examined by her)  she switched to a concierge style practice so she could have less patients and spend more time with each of them   Once I can afford this type of practice again  I will be switching back to her as she is  without question  an outstanding physician and compassionate human being ,positive,3063883

This is a cute little family business thats tucked away in a quiet Las Vegas neighborhood  I met the owner and his daughter and they were super sweet and passionate about their cooking  The food was amazing  I went with my parents and everything we had was very flavorful and fresh  Collectively  we tried the kashke bademjaan  the lamb shanks  and the chicken soltani  The meat was very moist and tender!

Very fancy place that my family has been coming to for years   The owner is a nice guy who comes over to our table to chat with us (weve known him from his previous restaurant)   The type of place youd go for an anniversary or birthday dinner  weve never had a bad experience here  Very nice atmosphere on the inside that reminds me of a decorated castle of some sort  complete with the large doors and ridiculously high ceilings to match Their steaks and seafood are their speciality (as the name suggests)   The waitstaff are extremely good at their job (water glass never got empty  they sneakily removed all empty dishes  etc)  so if theyre forgetful or rude you can probably bet it was on purpose  My personal favourite is their ribs  which can get a bit messy but they bring you a small waterdish to wash your fingers   Lobster and filet mignon is also a family favourite ,positive,5816712
Be carful what you order at this restaurant The carne asada plate is ridiculous with the meat chopped up and little rice with beans for $15 00 plus tax  I cant believe at that they do not give tortillas  WOW!,negative,450030

Went here for lunch back in March before we went to see Wicked  Didnt have much time so we got food that we thought would be prepped easily  Shared the Cold Pikilia platter (with the different spreads)  very good and filling  Especially liked the Htipi  super rich  We got the gyro platter and the chicken souvlaki platter  I know  I know  not very adventurous but delicious  Had a nice atmosphere  Waitress was just okay  but it looked like they had someone designated to refill drinks and she kept the water and tea a coming  Will definitely go back and try some other dishes when were not pressed for time  PS their Tzatziki is very good  very dense  spreadable almost  seems like they use shredded cucumber which changes the texture ,positive,6232400
Some of the best pulled pork I have had in life  let alone in the Phoenix valley  My waiter Kody was fantastic and and the meat was the perfect amount of smokey sweetness!

We had a totally positive experience with Troys Tree Service   Troy and his whole crew were professional  hard working and prompt   We had them remove a large Fruitless Mulberry  an old dying Ash  two 60 ft Mexican palms and a clump of several house height California Palms   Every crew member was constantly working hard   My husband liked that Troy offered a senior discount AND a Military discount  usually you must ask and there is only one discount  not so with Troy   Plus we got a multi tree discount   We will definitely recommend Troy and his crew to our friends and neighbors ,positive,6014091

First off I want to say I have had my fair share of experiences with towing companies and Speedway Towing is by far the best experience I have ever had  Las Vegas is known for its heat  so when my car broke down in the middle of the day I immediately started dreading the thought of having to endure this sizzling sun for however long a tow would take  However  immediately was welcomed by the dispatcher at Speedway Towing  This person was very respectful and had great enthusiasm in help me  Surprisingly  it only took them 20 minutes to get to me which was very fast compared to any other towing company Id used before  Mike was so sweet and fast with hooking my car up  I had no issues with this company  the service was astonishing  and I will definitely be using them again! Thanks again Mike and Speedway Towing you guys were wonderful :),positive,1138145
Food was great  portions were large  It was busy  expected on a Saturday morning but the waitress checked in often and refilled our coffee  The downside was that it was about 30 mins for our food and the table who arrived after us was served first  Otherwise  great food  great service and we will definitely be back!,positive,1232677
Ordered the fish taco and local style grilled fish (ono with Asian flair)  The fish taco was good but there are many better  cheaper options  The grilled fish was dry and flavor was average  I would not recommend it if you dont like wasabi or the slight sting in your nose wasabi gives  Overall  wouldnt come again  Not for the price ,negative,4115827
Im a fan of this Marshalls  Its nice and clean and Ive never had any issues  They carry VOSS water in the glass bottles  which is rare  They always have at least SOMEthing we cant live without  The kitchen section is fun  The housewares is nice  I love discount shopping  and this is always one of our first stops if we need something quick and dont want to spend a lot on it ,positive,2899687
I had an issue w/ a blockage in my home   I had another service provider come out the day before to fix the issue and $325 later  I still had a blockage  After quoting me one price to camera my line  they then said it would be 4 TIMES that amount to camera after trying to rooter my lines I called Darrels to come camera my line   Showed up towards the end of the window (why they didnt get 5 stars)  BUT they found the blockages  rootered them  and solved the blockage issue   Wish I called them first   would have saved me my initial $325 I paid someone else ,positive,2126930

Krystal is by far the most talented stylist I have ever had  I found her close to 3 years ago and have been to countless Avedas and other upscale salons in numerous states in search of someone of equal talent  Unfortunately for me  I have never found one  When I lived in South Carolina I would drive 2 hours to see her  now that I live in Washington DC  I drive 6 and a half  It doesnt matter if you have short or long hair she always does an outstanding job  Your hair not only looks amazing when you first get it done but  as it grows out  it still looks just as good as the first day when you left the salon I am a huge fan of Toni and Guy in general  They shutdown their salons weekly to train their stylist on the latest trends and new products from their line  (Personally  I only use Bed Head  SFactor  and Catwalk products on my hair  all being the Toni and Guy line )I promise you will never be disappointed!,positive,3377848
They have a great variety to choose from! I was impressed with how many options they gave me for my flooring!

Delivery went very smooth and fast Great service and experience!,positive,5122180
BWW is one of those places where you have to know what they are good at  and focus on that  BWW is good for: wings  bar food  beer  and the game  Thats about it  If youre expecting gourmet burgers  look elsewhere  If you want a place to watch all of the games and get reliably decent wings  they hold up  Are they the best? No  Still  I never have to guess about what Im going to receive  and the quality of the product they do best is quite good  If you go for lunch  sit at the bar and get one of the specials  Not bad for under $10 with a drink ,positive,432805
Whichever toppings you choose for your cone or cup  they will also be put on vanilla soft serve  the only ice cream flavour offered Ice cream is kind of bland and has the taste and mouthfeel of an iced lowerfat milk rather than cream   Fun to choose your own gourmet dips and ice cream toppings  but they dont really taste very strongly of whatever flavour theyre supposed to be  Not my top ice cream spot pick   ,neutral,6377442

It was alright   not the best sushi Ive ever had  but not the worst   And  plus  we were in Surprise   so I had low expectations   It was definitely more expensive than we expected   And  they were missing key ingredients like pickled radish or gourd  so they couldnt make a Futomaki roll or any of the more authentic Japanese rolls   Its Americanized sushi  but hey  its in Surprise   whats that saying about a thirsty man in the desert?,neutral,3226154

Ive been to that place two times  The place is dark  dirty  washroom disgusting  The cashier was the same person that made the bubble tea and he wasnt sympathetic at all  Didnt great and neither said goodbye or anything  The sweets displayed there were not appealing That is the only place that I know around Yonge and Bloor  I was craving for some bubble tea and went there  I drank a Honeydew milk green tea with tapioca balls It was terrible  The milk was kind of watery  no taste of honeydew  the tapioca balls were way too soft (and that is the best part! I love biting them)  I was drinking and something came to my mouth  it looked like earth!! I dont know what it was  but after that I couldnt drink it anymore  It was an absolutely deception   I think at some location such as Yonge and Bloor a Bubble tea store should be way better ,negative,3025562

Generally an OK Gym   If I would have looked a little closer before I signed up I might have noticed:Changerooms are among the dirtiest of all the gyms Ive been to in Northwest Calgary Shower are often grimier than a sketchy campground on a long weekend    bring flip flops The same machines are broken week after week   Youd expect a facility of this size (especially one that charges a maintenance fee) to be more on top of this   Whether a broken pedal on a bike  a clunky elliptical  or a tv that doesnt work its very predictable as the broken units have been that way since I signed up 8 months ago   Overall its decent but not much TLC towards the facility and it shows Not really deal breakers as location is the main thing for me  however I think if I had it to do over I would have looked closer at the Y or World Health Club up around Crowfoot ,neutral,1320124

For airport food  this place serves relatively healthy  okaytasting food that actually has a number of choices for a vegan  However  this place is a far cry from the likes of Chipotle  Qdoba  or Moes I ordered a small strawberry banana smoothie made with soy milk for $4 96  The classic tofu burrito bowl I ordered came out to be $7 99 plus $1 79 for guacamole  For the dollop of guac I got  this pricing was kind of ridiculous  (It looks like I got more guac than Im describing from the pic  but rest assured its because the lid squished it down ) The corn also tasted plasticky  like it came straight from a can  Trying to get the employee to give me extra of anything in my burrito bowl was a hopeless tug of war where I was on the losing side  If I was in the Cleveland airport  I would eat here again but not very enthusiastically 2 5 stars,neutral,1251223
This was our first visit after reading the glowing review in the local paper   We came on a Friday night at 5:00 when they first opened so there were no crowds but it filled up quickly soon after   We ordered the salmon and yellowtail sashimi which was so fresh and amazing (from Scotland and Japan)  best we have had in a long time!  Also had the nasu dengaku (miso eggplant)  takoyaki (octopus rice ball)  grilled chicken hearts and gizzards  and mackerel   The grilled items were good but could use some more seasoning   The presentation of each dish was simple but elegant   The service was excellent    the server was very friendly  the dishes came at just the right pace  and dishes were removed quickly as we finished   Prices were very reasonable   Overall  we were pleased and will return to try other dishes ,positive,5646260

A friend couldnt decide between the roast beef sandwich or the green chile corned beef hash so he got both   The sandwich was pretty good but the corned beef was divine  Slightly crispy but not hard  They ran out of orange juice so we had freshly squeezed lemonade  Everything was terrific and the service was great   Highly recommended ,positive,2146967
I didnt think Id have this much fun in a spice shop! They have jars with each of the spices so that you can smell each variety  The layout is impressive and not too overwhelming  The staff is incredibly knowledgeable about all the spices in the store  And they have a very cozy coloring table for kids who want to pass the time while their adult counterparts are shopping! Even if you dont end up buying much (prices are a little higher than at the grocery store!)  its a fun experience and opens your senses (pun intended!) to the wide range of spices that are out there!,positive,2004068

Get the majerles wings! Hold cow! Secret sauce was the best wing sauce Ive ever had  The order came out freezing cold which was a bummer but I sent it back and it came back piping hot & delicious Service was slow slow slow  Return visits from the waitress was non existent  This would of been a 5 Star if service was prompt ,neutral,1323982
Really really good food for the price  It all seems fresh  Chicken and veg  Is really good  Noodles are authentic chinese lo mein and loved the sesseme and fried shrimp  Lived near it 3 years and questioned the place  Now I just feel like I missed out until now,positive,4318219
This is a must see stop when in Vegas  You will need two visits to take it all in  The bar is huge and has a slightly different feel depending on where you sit  There is a back room that is more dark  there are thatched seating area along the side of the bar that are open to the whole bar and best for people watching and making the scene  then there are more private booths at the front of the bar if you dont want to be in the limelight  But the whole bar itself is a journey  a story  a ride  Look at the walls and read the signs on the artifacts  It is like a Disneyland ride experience  They have top DJs and entertainment  Oh  and they have a vast tropical drink menu! Most of their drinks are strong so beware ,positive,5226780
Super cute little place  definitely cozy  and loved being seated right in the front so we could see everything going on outside as we had lots of friends in Montreal at the same time so did lots of waving!  The owner and chef was very very nice  cash only  Alex had some plain pasta and Jack had the manicotti  I had a salad and it was just absolutely perfect for lunch!  Gelato for dessert!  Dont expect a menu   todays selection is written on the board and the chef and owner will tell you what hes made after youve been seated! What a great experience,positive,4645403
We had dinner reservations at the kingfish house this past Sunday afternoon When the waitress asked if we needed straws for a drinks and we said yes she went on a rant about her studying to be a marine biologist and how we were polluting the ocean she treated us like ecoterrorist after that we got terrible service we had to ask twice the hostess to bring us different things for our table that was my first and last time I will eat at any Kingfish House Restaurant If they have a no plastic straw policy provide us with a paper straw or none at all but dont insult the customer I emailed their corporate headquarters but dont really expect anything from them Theres too many other fine restaurants in Henderson and Las Vegas to go to Im done with the kingfish house,negative,6020348
Ive used Mikes Collision for several years after the referral from my neighbor who races and operates a Viper shop recommended Mikes  They do all his body work for him   Since that referral  Ive had them work on 2 of our vehicles and also my brothers car   Just recently they worked on my truck after a rear ending hit and run accident   Mikes did a thorough inspection after the insurance review since there are areas that the agent couldnt see   They were in contact with the insurance carrier often with additional items for claim and repair  updated me often on progress  hold ups  etc so I was in the loop always   Upon return  my repairs were fantastic  truck looked wonderful and was also cleaned up and spotless   Thanks Mikes for the consistent quality work you all do ,positive,3079931
Waffles  crepes and hot drinks were very good  This will definitely satisfy your sweet tooth  Im knocking off 1 star because the lady at the register seemed impatient and almost a little rude  And we were served on paper Christmas plates  Real plates and cutlery would have been nice ,positive,5891358
My cousin worker brought me and unfortunately it wasnt a good crepe i had got the carnasada one and the salsa just made it really mushy and gross and unfortunately i  couldnt enjoy it  The place is cute and the staff is nice just didnt enjoy my meal ,neutral,3673425

Ive always liked the Union Grill and have been coming here since I moved to the city in 2003  Its traditional American fare and by no means will the menu blow you away with creativity or culinary ingenuity  but it does serve satisfying hearty meals at a reasonable price  Ive went here with friends  Ive went here with dates  Ive been here by myself  so its the kind of casual place that suits whatever you might be looking for  The menu changes occasionally depending on the time of the year  but I usually stick to the basics like the Reuben or the fish tacos  Ive had the famous Turkey Devonshire which is good  but very heavy which makes it sort of overwhelming  If you dont feel like waiting for a table or are by yourself take a seat at the bar and order your food there  Its a nice little restaurant bar with a nice beer and liquor selection which also has some nice happy hour specials ,positive,2966517

My family and I have been going to the House of Leng since it opened a few years back  My parents usually eat there about once a week and never have any complaints  I have tried everything on the menu from the Chicken Lettuce Wraps to the Garlic Scallops  The Lo Mien is great and so is the Sesame Shrimp  I could name off quite a few delicious options but you should try it for yourself  I recommend going during lunch which is served until 3:00  This is an inexpensive way to sample what they have to offer and with each plate you get an egg roll and fried rice ,positive,3690560
Sam is amazing! He always does a really good job and puts a lot of time and passion into his craft! The price is also very reasonable ,positive,4374260
Had not been to Vegas in a year  Looked forward to ordering the Monte Crisco again  Ok Actually I dreamed about it Soooooooooo I ordered it  waited patiently for it to arrive  and when it did  I dug right in to enjoy it  YUUMMMM! I took about 5 bites (OK I actually inhaled) Then I decided to eat the strawberry that was an edible garnish Bit into the strawberry  and a brown crumbly dust fell out of the leafy part of it  I said to myself YUM!! A dusting of chocolate! Dipped my finger into it  AND CRUNCH  Tasted like dirt  WHY?Because it WAS dirt  It got all over my plate and my lovely  Monte Crisco  Appetite instantly gone  I promptly  with a heavy heart and sad tummy  told the waitress about the dirt  She was totally sweet about it  and even went and chastised the kitchen about what happened  Without even asking her  the meal was comped  but I left hungry  I did not want to eat anything else from there Im sad  but I dont see myself going there again next time Im in Vegas ,negative,1659277

For a fancy restaurant  this place was only casual dress! The food was beautifully plated and delicious  Even the appetizer portions were huge! We had a party of 4 and we didnt order that much because of the large portion size  Everything was just phenomenal! We ordered the scallop and shrimp special they had going on along with the veggie appetizer and rice pilaf and bruschetta  Overall everything was above par and just great  Definitely will consider it the next time Im in Vegas  Its also conveniently located right next to Fremont St  which Ive never been too and it was a great experience to walk around that area after our delightful dinner ,positive,1248554
This goes out to management  Dj Nova has to go  His mixing is all over the place  By the time you get up to go to the dance floor hes changed the song to something that doesnt even work  Hell go top 40  80s rap  R&B  within a minute  The live bands are better  Please get some new talent or we wont be back  I just paid$340 for bottle service and Im totally regretting it   ok it just got better  my buddys dad came who is a marine that served for this country  they told him that he had to remove his hat and pay $3 to check it  They should have just told him thank you for your service and let him in  Oh did I mention they made him pay to get in after we had a table ,negative,5185030
My friend took me here for burgers one night  and I was surprised how much I enjoyed the food  The burgers are a bit unusual  especially the cheese options  If your into brie  goat  blue  or peeper jack cheese  than you would definitely find these burgers to your liking  I myself am not as found of the more fancier cheeses  and I still really enjoyed them  I wasnt a fan of the potato chips though  they tasted good  but I much prefer fries  (substituting for fries costs more) As for the drinks  I felt that the Winking Lizard had more different types  and I only found one or two drinks that sounded good to me  They have a black board near the bar listing a lot of drinks  but I could barely read the hot pink scrawl  I guess my only complaint is the size of the area  which is rather small  The beer is a decent size  but the tables around were relatively small  and all occupied  There was no area to wait  so you kinda just stand there awkwardly by the door till someone leaves ,positive,3736025
This location is not as good as North York location  The ramen broth taste artificial  I ordered pork shoulder  it tastes strong unpleasant piggy flavour and chewy  cant really eat it  Chicken karaage tastes good  but not too much flavour  Price is quiet high  music is noisy and we need to yelling to each other ,neutral,5372335
Very nice people who did an amazing job on two of our computers   One was the transfer of files from an old computer to a newly purchased one   The other computer was a laptop that was running very slow   The laptop is now running great  its like it is a new computer   I am already recommending these guys to friends   They do an amazing job!,positive,5846167

Wow so disappointing I have been going here for years and the service just keeps declining  My pedicure lasted all of 12 min and you now have to pay extra for them to smooth out your calluses  Seriously what is a pedicure if they dont address calluses thats the whole point  Yes the massage and paint are nice (the massage also lacked significantly) but the callus removal/smoothing is the purpose  Lisa really should be more aware of the service that is being provided or for that matter not provided  Very disappointing,negative,6459720
We usually go for the pizza but this time I wanted to try something different  In ordered the spaghetti and meatball  It was okay the sauce was so watery that it seems like I was eating noddle soup  The meatball had no flavor what so ever  We also order the chicken wings which never disappoint  Always crispy and nice and saucy! The salads were nothing special seems like they just opened a bag of spring mix and put it in a bowl  What saved dinner was the dessert we had  It was a zeppoli sundae! Lots of cinnamon and sugar recover zeppolis topped with ice cream topped with lots of whipped cream and chocolate drizzle  Yes is it delicious,neutral,6125012

Pitta Souvli is without a doubt my favorite Greek restaurant in the Valley  It is locally owned  has fantastic customer service and the food is amazing  I am a vegetarian and this place always has delicious options for me  However  prevegetarian days were filled with their tuna salad which is out of this world :) Dont miss out on an order of the greek fries when you visit!,positive,4201400
This is a good little establishment   We popped in for lunch while we were visiting ASU and its old timey  small and rustic   I ordered a veggie burger based on the reco of someone in line and it was pretty good   The fries were simple and tasty and I got a mug of cold root beer which hit the spot   The burgers that other folks got seemed tasty as well   The only bad item were the fried mushrooms  they were crispy on the outside but the breading was too thick or something because the inner parts were still doughy ,positive,5210306

Yes  the Steel City is known for football  But three Stanley Cups aint shabby The Penguins as an organization are awesome  They do numerous charity events and take being part of the community seriously  For all the problems with young players in professional sports leagues (cough  Ben cough)  the Penguins have strayed away from the drama As for the hockey itself  its great  The new era of HCDB and young core makes this team exciting to watch and reinvigorates the sport itself If you go to Consolieum  eat some nachos (filling and worth their price) and get some cotton candy from the old cotton candy man (oh  you will know who Im talkin bout when you get there) and enjoy the game!Side note: There has been criticism about the location of the arena in the immediate neighborhood  but other problems have plagued the area  which I find difficult to pin on one hockey organization (as the arena is used for much more than just hockey ),positive,6508446
We had a really great meal at Cactus Club Cafe  We sat at the bar and enjoyed a nice bottle of Prosecco  Our meal began with the Tuna Stack and Beef Carpaccio  which were great appetizers to share  They both were delicious and very fresh  My husband enjoyed his Hunter Chicken and couldnt stop talking about how moist and juicy the chicken was and how the mashed potatoes were extremely creamy  I enjoyed the Tuna Poke Bowl  It was the perfect mix of all the fresh ingredients of OceanWise Ahi Tuna  Edamame  Cucumber  Mango  Avocado and Rice  with crispy tempura  The food was really flavourful and we really enjoyed the vibe of the bar  Kyla was an excellent server with a great personality and was very attentive  I have to particularly thank Jamie  the General Manager  who took time to speak with us and show us his wonderful hospitality  Jamie really knows how to treat his customers and is a wonderful asset to the Cactus Club experience  We will definitely be back soon ,positive,6012967
It was your typical Red Lobster experience   The food was good but not great (except for the biscuits  I dream about those bad boys)  it took care of my craving for clam chowder and fried shrimp   The server I had was nice and he was pretty quick with bringing everything to me and making sure my water was filled   I think AOK pretty much sums up the whole thing ,neutral,3240281

Good food  great service!Worth every dime! We did a Siri search and found this restaurant in the area we were driving from  A small local joint  look n feel just like a takeout joint  We thought to pass it and go for a restaurant setting but kiddies were hungry and reviews were inviting so stepped in   Glad we did! Great service  good food  wonderful fusion created  Spice levels were suiting our palate  We would return to this joint  if we get a chance ,positive,1360166
I had the misfortune of coming here on Black Friday with my sisters and it was a huge cluster   The music was loud  there was walltowall people with no room to walk anywhere or touch/smell the products  and admittedly  the staff wasnt very happy to be there   I do love Lush Products  but this store is a mad house for the holidays ,neutral,2159578
This is probably the lowest Jersey Mikes rating Ive ever given   Two things rubbed me really wrong about my visit here   First was the owner/managers attitude   He said something to my wife about her order  I forget what it was exactly    trying to be funny I guess  but it came off in a total dbag style   Second thing was the kid ringing up our order   He looked about 10  Arent there some sort of child labor laws  or does anything go in Vegas?,negative,5322570

Omg this was the best jambalaya I have ever eaten  The restaurant has a huge selection and genre of food  Its like a bj on steroids  I highly recommend anyone staying at the Venetian to stop by here because it is conveniently located downstairs  The portions are a huge as well  I will be eating here everyday!,positive,4034597
I am so happy I found this place! I had a Clock that I loved so much and all of a sudden  it just stopped working  I had gone online looking for similar styles  but couldnt find anything I liked as much  I decided I was going to try and see if I can get it repaired rather than buy a new one  And thats when I found JJC clocks  Its actually a super cool antique store but the owner  George  also has a clock repair person in his store  I had a set price in mind that I didnt want to exceed to repair it  Lo and behold  they were able to fix my clock within budget   And they couldnt have been nicer  Love these mom and pop places that actually appreciate your business and make sure to treat you that way   Bonus  theyre open on Sundays  Highly recommend ,positive,1877573
We visited this place today for the first time   Weve driven by it countless times  on our way to Target  or Chipotle   We had an Entertainment Book coupon so we decided to check it out   BIG mistake The service was really terrible   The ladies behind the counter were pretty rude  and obviously did not want to be working there   The salsa bar was disgusting  with warm salsa (!) which had little to no taste  if thats even possible   We ordered a barbacoa burrito  a bean and cheese burrito and a kids quesadilla   Only the quesadilla was edible   We are Mexican food aficinados  but this was truly gross food   (I have an iron stomach and got extremely sick within an hour of eating the barbacoa burrito )The icing on the cake of our visit  so to speak  was the cheap wicker type seats on the chairs   Two nasty splinters became embedded in our young daughters knit pants/rear end  causing her to cry in pain   Nice ,negative,6128521

We had a top notch experience at Spice Thai on a chill Saturday night   While Paninis was slammed  Spice Thai was not   We gladly accepted this   The restaurant was quiet and mostly desolate except for another table and take out orders   Thats a scary sign but thankfully we roughed it out and got some top notch Thai We started with shrimp spring rolls and went on to soup   The Miso Soup was much better than anything you will find at Japanese places  and the Kimchi soup was amazing  and hot!  We prefer spice and heat  so you can select your level of hotness   My basil chicken was sooo good because it was fried chicken  with basil  and peppers   The Pad Thai was also some of the best weve had   And best yet we had food to take home for the next day ,positive,6014082
3 things that i love about this place  1  Unlimited croutons to compliment my soup 2  Handful of iced tea choices  3  The comfy simplicity of the place But not limited to: the wide selection of hot gourmet soups that nourish my body  They pick the best selection of beef for pastrami  Free self serve ice cream in a cone  Staff is overall friendly  Food is so very filling  I always find myself bringing extra food home In a togo box  But then again  maybe its from the unlimited croutons I use to dip in my tomato soup  I definitely love coming here ,positive,45844
We decided to try this place after reading some good reviews on yelp  Great decision!! We will absolutely be going back  Delish and great price with free Thriftys ice cream  The only downside is that its tucked back in a mostly empty lot so people cant see it  Hope that doesnt affect the traffic it may or may not get too much  Totally recommend this place!!!,positive,5983431
It is 4 star because I think they deserve it   Also Im not a fan of the modern decor but I will say this it is clean very clean with good service and a good pho  Also the pricing is what it is probably because off the location being st the mouth of anthem   There are just so many pho places on eastern I think they need to step up the flavor a bit   One good note is opening at 10 am as sometimes we do pho for Sunday breakfast   Been here many many times and highly recommend it ,positive,3206557

Costco really is a one stop shop and that includes when its time to fuel up  Easily the lowest prices in town  usually by twenty cent or more  can really add up over the month and year for that matter  Im thinking it pays for my executive membership  sweet  !! Lines   yup theyll have them if you go later in the day but it moves pretty quick so I just kick back and listen to the music  If you go early around 6:30am to 7:00am theres rarely a wait so get your ass up early and go or dont complain  Or be courteous to your fellow Costcoian  you know the drill  have your cards ready  get off the cell phone  pump your gas and the line moves quick  Four Stars for this location as its really busy for quicker lines the MLK location rarely has a wait ,positive,777739
This is hands down the best sushi resto in the GTA! My boyfriend and I have been coming here for 5 years now and it offers consistency every time  If you come here  youll receive IMPECCABLE service not only from the servers but the management as well  You will also find QUALITY fish and a GREAT ambience  The sashimi and sushi combo sets offer a wide selection of fresh fish and the presentation speaks for itself in these photos  This place is perfect for group gatherings as I have come here many times to celebrate birthday parties  You will also find a comfortable atmosphere with TVs  booths  and trendy music  Overall  this sushi resto is worth the drive if you are not in the area!,positive,5266001
I have been to many other Tropical Smoothie Cafes before and this is definitely a good one My girlfriend and I came here to take a break from the immense heat  grab a wrap and a smoothie  then be back on our way  Unfortunately there was no AC and it was actually in the 90s inside the small place  They did not have a full menu so the normal wraps I was used to and loved  they did not make  We ended up grabbing a random smoothie and leaving to somewhere else to drink them and relax  The smoothies themselves were pretty good  and the people serving us were nice  But that doesnt fix the rest of the problems they were having and the small menu  If they fix these things I would rate it higher ,neutral,2228805
Very long wait (I get it  youre new)  It seems like drive thru staff at window dont pay attention  They tried to send me on my way without giving me half my order  I ordered an iced mocha that came completely unstirred  What I ended up with was a mouthful of chocolate syrup  because the milk/espresso was all on top  with a pile of chocolate on the bottom  What drive thru DOESNT STIR DRINKS? (Yeah  thats what we want to do  open a drink  in our car  and try to stir chocolate syrup into a cold beverage   )The sandwich was good  though VERY small compared to places like wildflower bread Co   and paradise bakery  Also  the tuna to mayo/dressing ratio seems to be off  I feel like I got a sandwich that was mostly mayo  I dont think Ill return for that  All in all  11 bucks (after tax) for a coffee drink and a sandwich  That price seems high  for what I received  after a verrrrrry loooonnnnggg wait  I think I would rather go elsewhere ,negative,5840931
Man  I wish I could come here every week! Came in for my birthday breakfast and got the Musketeer omelette  very good and perfectly cooked with a side of panfried sliced potatoes  The coffee was amazing for being plain ol coffee (it had a brand on the menu but I forgot [again] to write it down)  Right now  they have a bunch of seasonal pumpkin dishes on offer  We tried the pumpkin bread pudding and it was AWESOME  I want to come in soon and try the pumpkin cheesecake pancakes ,positive,3576430

This place is the worst  stay far far away!Having come back from out of the country to find that my tire had a small hole in it  I made a poor decision due to jetlag and decided to go to this Midas to get it fixed instead of going to the much better mechanic 2 streets down  I come in and they tell me its going to take 10 minutes to fix  10 minutes turned into 1 hour of me waiting there with no update  To their credit  yes  they fixed the hole in my tire  but they also broke the stem of my TPMS sensor  something they didnt own up to  Luckily  getting a new stem was a $3 part  but they made a point to make it seem like they were doing me a favor by not charging me to get it installed  Suffice to say  I did not go back there for their service Instead  go to Washington Lee Service  It took them 10 minutes and I was out the door ,negative,5520183

Our fleet used to be serviced by them but that all changed when we would constantly need to take our vans back in for the same service since it was not done properly  We have used parks since 1998 but no more  When trying to speak with management or the GM we get apologies but no correction  So we have taken our business elsewhere Sad to see a company that was a pleasure to deal with turn into a cheap knock off of Hendrick  At least with Hendrick they have customer service and business development as the focus ,negative,4132925

My friend from Spain told me that this not the authentic Spain Culinary but most of dishes tastes food despite of the fact some recipes are not originally from Spain  I also like their service and their atmosphere with candlelight ,positive,3734122

This place is AMAZING!!! Im so thankful my friend told me about it    I got 1 lb  of shrimp with the hottest seasoning there was available I believe it was cajun and the corn drenched in the seasoning was SO delicious!!! I got salt & pepper  squeezed lemon juice and dipped my shrimp in it and ahhhhh enjoyed it to the fullest so good I had to order another lb  of shrimp lol     Thankfully our wait wasnt bad we were seated right away but I did notice a little after there was a line of people waiting   Service was GREAT  The waitress was friendly  helpful & informative  Prices were good for 1 lb  of shrimp about $10  sides such as corn or rice i want to say were $2    Overall a GREAT experience and cant wait for the W  Hollywood location to open since its closer to me    You have to try HOT & JUICY CRAWFISH!!!,positive,5418274
Above and beyond in cleanliness  variety of snack and most of all Service! I left my wallet on the womens restroom counter and called 5 hours later  An employee had found it  turned it in and even refused a tip when I came back the next day to claim it  I wish they were in Charlotte  Whenever Im on I85 I will give them my business!,positive,144338
Breakfast place not open till 1230? Poor service  This place should and probably is closing down soon due to poor location service and hours open  Small and dingey,negative,592947
Good pizza  Great price The inside is kinda outdated and warm  Dont think the place has ac  Drink selection is small  Id recommend this place if youre looking for a reasonably priced pie with pretty good taste ,positive,1371414
We have just moved to the area and also had family in town  We were quite a large group (12 people) and came in on a Sunday morning in addition! This place worked extra hard to make sure they could find seating for all of us  I watched them provide the kid tables as much service as the adults received  Plus  the food was phenomenal! The decor was great  It was such a nice  pleasant visit  We did not realize how small it was reading the reviews and photos online  yet they still did an amazing job accommodating us spur of the moment! Cant wait to have a reason to go back! Oh  and order their lunch meat and start saving some money there  They have a meat and cheese menu and I cannot wait to give that a shot as well  Prices they reviewed with me were definitely $3$4 cheaper than the grocery store ,positive,6046843
Been here many times  and have never been disappointed  The food is always good  breakfast  lunch  or dinner  and Ive never had bad service  Great venue to see a show  Didnt care too much for the Gospel Brunch  but I was extremely hung over  and it was a bit loud ,positive,474939
Service and Food were EXEMPLARY!!! We sat in the bar area and the bartender/waiter was attentive  punctual  and generous  Later  the manager made his rounds and ensured we were well l taken care of (which we were) This visit was the best weve had to date; from any restaurant and we are happy to recommend and return!(Youll be lucky to be visit during Williams shift  Hell take care if you!),positive,4408465
Ray was an amazing server! She was really friendly and attentive  Went on a Sunday and didnt have a reservation and the hostess was still able to seat us  Thought next time Ill think ahead and get a reservation  Honestly Ive had better scrambles  but still the service and atmosphere was amazing ,positive,4289017
Josh was so nice we couldnt have dairy and made sure out order was correct  Also had a friend who was at Taco Bell for the first time and he made it so memorable! Excellent customer service!,positive,3314423
Convient   Made me feel like I was in the ghetto because she said she needed to hold my back pack at the register  She did not greet me with a hello or a smile  After my purchase I said thank you and she didnt respond  Complete fail  Bring back a grocery store or better yet a 711 ,negative,770088
My husband just opened his own combatives gym next door  so we figured we would try the restaurants in the same complex  I must say  the food is really delicious here  I ordered the Chicken Lo Mein and the Wonton soup and was pleasantly surprised at how yummy and flavorful it is  I am so glad we found a great restaurant that we can eat at after class or during lunch  The service is also very friendly and we look forward to trying additional items on the menu ,positive,3780528
Ive visited this location twice  The salads are always fresh  I just dont think Ive found the right combination for my palate as of yet  But  the staff are always friendly  I love the fact that they always seem overstaffed  Reduces the wait when you have more people working  Certainly plan to give it another go ,positive,3081772
Pretty impressed with this place   Good beer selection  I had a porter and its just right   The southern caprese was as good as other reviews have indicated The shrimp and grits was the perfect amount  although slightly too much heat for me   The goat cheese topping the grits made it tolerable for me The grand finale for me was the lamp lollipops  the only thing I thought a tad disappointing was the lamb was not medium rare  but still very tender at medium done   My server was so nice she asked the kitchen to remake it!  I originally wanted to give this place a 4 star but it deserves a 5 star because they care!  I posted before and after so you be the judge of it ,positive,4242950
I used a certificate I purchased for a massage and trial spray face tan on 4/10/12   Jan was very personable and accommodating   She sprayed my face and arms so I could experience how the spray tan worked after I had a relaxing massage   I was impressed and look forward to checking further into the healthy spray tan ,positive,2661112
In terms of brunch  would forego this place  Between the FIKA breakfast and the eggs benny with salmon  no real standouts and not really worth it for the price  There are better places to spend your brunch money  But hey  if youre chillin here and feel like getting some food to substantiate the baked goods yer havin  go for it Otherwise  real cute cafe  front patio  couches in the main section  large communal table in the back  back patio (with a hammock!)  Decor adds a nice ambiance  Feels like youre hanging out in a nice house full o strangers  hahDO TRY:Id say FIKAs got a nice touch on their FIKA iced coffee  cardamom and mint are interesting ingredients to include  The coffee goes down real smoothly though  its really more of an iced latte   Raisin scones are served with fresh apple jam (love!) and are extremely fluffy  Not your usual bready texture so give em a try  Also  eyeing the cinnamon buns  man  those look good ,neutral,3182175
This is a really nice burger spot in Charlotte  I had the Bang Bang Burger with multiple sauces  It was very flavorful and filling  If you are in the Charlotte area make sure to stop here ,positive,5234930
I had to bring my car in at the end of last year because I was told it was leaking some kind of liquid  I messaged the shop to see if they could check it out for me  they were able to work around my schedule and got my car right in to have it checked out  They were able to check my car out in just a short amount of time and called me to let me know they could not find anything wrong  Went to pick up my car and wasnt charged a fee or anything  I was really impressed and will definitely be back for any car service I need done and will be recommending D&M to everyone I know ,positive,2165943
I would like to start by saying that Cozumel indeed serves perfectly acceptable Mexican dishes that would certainly please a majority of their customers   It is  however  my personal opinion that if a menu offers vegetarian options  that they are indeed vegetarian  and not simply a vegetable based option   There are a vast number of Mexican restaurants whose rice is made with chicken stock and/or their beans contain lard  and Cozumel is included in this group   A few miles north on the same street one can find Si Senor whose rice and beans are free from animal products and truly live up to their vegetarian claims ,negative,2872215
I had a wonderful experience with Dr  Christenbury  I booked online fairly last minute through ZocDoc and was seen promptly and was treated wonderfully by his whole team  Thank you!,positive,2122918
Love the family environment feeling here  Both locations are family owned and operated  Both offer great service  Im sure not everyone that works there is not related  but you wouldnt know it because they are so friendly and treat you like family  The food is fresh and flavorful  Pomegranate chicken its probably their most popular dish  A definite winner! Lemon soup is also really good  The only one criticism I have is that they used canned peaches on the grilled skewers  Would be better if they used fresh peaches  Great spot for lunch or dinner!,positive,3486346
Derek and Mark were outstanding   They did a great job in cleaning my tile and carpets throughout the house   They are timely  efficient  knowledgeable  thorough and very persistent in making certain the work is completed to the clients satisfaction   I have called upon them to solve difficult stain removal and they truly were magicians in solving the issue   Many thanks to these professional and caring service providers   Linda  Henderson,positive,872182
We stopped in yesterday afternoon and were greeted with a smile  We heard some great music from the band that was playing  we really enjoyed their song selections  We found the last two open seats at the bar and the bartenders were all great  We ended up staying a little longer than planned because we were enjoying the band so much  We even ran into an old friend that spotted us from across the room  Drinks were good and I even tried a new beer  Bartenders were working their tails off and doing so with a smile on their face  The only thing I could even mention to improve would be if it could have been cooler in there  But honestly  were in Arizona and we had a near record high temp yesterday so its all good  Cant really fault them for Mother Nature! We still had a great time and are looking forward to coming back!,positive,6112760

I need to update my review   I went to Nourish tonight and was pleasantly surprised   In the past the food and my service have just been okay   Tonight  my protein burger with a side of avocado and sweet potato salad were excellent   Service was good too   The menu has changed since the last time I visited too   I will give this place a few more tries!,positive,2486101

Alright   Here is the scope   Youre in Vegas  right?  Youre looking for the places to go and be seen   The place you want to share with your friends when you go back home   Youre looking for the atmosphere over dinner that will lead into the night   Whether you are dining with your boy/girlfriend  or hosting a group of friends for a bachelor(ette) party  you must go to STK!  The music is loud  and the drinks are strong   We met an individual  Charity Faith  who made the night even more enjoyable   Shes one of the managers at Bagatelle  but has her feet wet with great services at STK   [In Vegas  its not who you are   its who you know]   When ordering your streak  make sure the waiter hears your order    the music was loud  and everyone was singing  that when I asked for a medium well  it came out well   No worries though  their service was impeccable!,positive,237399
Great! I had an absolutely horrendous  there are not even words to describe it bad haircut from Fantasy Cuts at Bathurst and Shepherd and it NEEDED to be fixed  Nahid booked my appointment the same day I called  cut my hair and fixed it to a decent cut  The other cut was so bad this will take months and a few visits to fix  The cost was more than reasonable and I will be going back ,positive,1607705
We were not impressed  Our order was just OK and it took a long time to come out  The place is very small and the manager was yelling at staff in front of us  pretty awkward  It was very cheap and we did get a lot of food for the money  but we wont be back  We came in based off of really good reviews on yelp so maybe we were just here on an off night  but we werent impressed ,negative,6167299
Best dam burger on the Vegas strip  a little pricey but well worth it  The service is impeccable fast  friendly and polite  There is a wait on Friday and Saturday so get there early or just be prepared for a little wait  The food is sooo good especially the tater tots!!,positive,525301
We recently visited the Blackthorn Steakhouse and all started off great   Grilled calamari was excellent  greek salad very fresh and tasty   Portions are generous but when the prime rib and the steak came out I might as well have thrown my shoe on the plate and tried to cut into it  would have been easier Im sure   My jaw bone got quite a  workout trying to chew on a $35 steak  A Steakhouse IT IS NOT   Friendly staff ,negative,6096486

Shawn did a fantastic job installing a door for our dobermans   He was very friendly  knowledgeable and professional   Despite having an absolute mess on the inside of my wall Shawn was able to work through it and find a solution with zero mess left behind   I would highly recommend Desert Star Pet Doors to anyone who is in the market ,positive,4433965
One of the best car rental centers Ive been to  The bus to and from the airport is ok  but once youre here  the place is huge  and well organized If you need to rent a car in Las Vegas  youll almost certainly need to come here to get it  I dont think youll be disappointed  Just be patient if its busy  It wasnt when we were there  but Im sure it can be   ,positive,4071166

This is my 2nd time here and I do like their donuts  unique it is!  I got the Stawberry champange donut which was very tasty and unique in itself   I would get this again This is a hipster kinda place and the service comes with alittle attitude   Because they do not label what donuts they have  you have to ask   I just felt like the girl helping us felt annoyed with us asking   UGH!!I would come back  but be careful of the hipster attitude you may get ,neutral,5270518
The girls and guys who worked with the fire did an amazing job  unfortunately they were not the star of the show  The magician was terrible and he was a stage hog  Also they kept claiming they were using gasoline and showed how you can pour it on some one and they do not get hurt   For a show that is 5 and up there should be safty warnings that gasoline is flammable even with air contact with fire and should not be used as a toy ,negative,4897207
The guy that was taking orders was completely zoned out  He asked us over 10 times to repeat ourselves  then still got the order wrong  EVERY PERSON WHO CAME IN AFTER US HAD TO REPEAT THEIR ORDERS SO MANY TIMES THE CUSTOMERS IN THE DINING ROOM WAS YELLING THE ORDERS TO HIM!!! The old lady that gives out the food was given out everything wrong  the manager was in the back goofing off  I get this is fast food and you get what you pay for  but this is a little ridiculous!!! We will never come back here again and I suggest everyone stay away also!! The one star is because you have to put one  I feel like they owe me some stars,negative,4901519

When this car wash opened it used to be amazing  Now half the time when I show up to get my car washed I have to wait for 5 minutes because the attendant also is a cashier inside the building  The last couple times I have been there some of the brushes dont spin when theyre trying to wash your car  To address some of the issues they started having an attendant scrub the front of your car with a brush because it wouldnt get it clean   Now they dont even do that  And half the vacuums dont work anymore  Its time to cancel my monthly membership and my wifes monthly membership because the values no longer there ,negative,6361042
If I could do a review without leaving a star I would The customer service at this location has always really sucked and today was no different I have them call three times to have somebody come down and cut some wood for me and after 30 minutes I finally left Every time I asked somebody for help they acted like I was asking him to do something outside of their job And every time you pass a worker they make every effort to not make eye contact with you just in case you ask for something I will not be returning to this location again ever ,negative,3089602
I only go here if I am studying or really really hungry I give this location a lower review  since when I was studying I ordered the Caesar salad (which I rarely have)  I was studying for an exam at the time  and usually dont try anything super new at these times  but I thought  what could go wrong with a Caesar salad? Well something tasted odd  and I ended up with food poisoning that had be bedbathroom ridden for a week  Since then  I am very very very cautious to eat anywhere new when I have something big coming up I have tried the various burgers here when studying  and they satisfy my hunger  Probably the only good thing is the chicken fingers as well  Really only have it when I am really hungry  I go to this location primarily for the attached Timmies and the outdoor summer parking with friends ,negative,2498825
Great great service  John arrived in 25 minutes and was so helpful in loading and hauling away moving debris  There were heavy plumbing fixtures as well as all the boxes and trash associated with move   Very courteous and reasonable as well!  I would use Happy Junk Removal again!,positive,1496956
This is the third time Ive been here  I went twice for bachelorette parties which included a tour and guided wine tasting  Tonight was just a simple dinner with a friend  We sat outside and were quickly greeted and given water  We split a bottle of wine (cheaper than getting it by the glass)  The appetizer portions were very generous  They always start you out with fresh delicious bread and this addicting dipping oil  I wish they sold it! I had the Pasta Sophia for dinner and it was amazing  Narcisi is a tad pricy but honestly not unreasonable  The portions are a great size too Be sure to buy a bottle or 5 on the way out!,positive,5354618
Amazing fresh  tasty and healthy option in the city of sin   I had the chicken with a side of lentil salad and broccolini   The coffee was what I needed this morning and tasted better than any Joe from Sbucks; its Counter Culture coffee   Cant wait to indulge in a lemon ricotta cookie for dessert ,positive,279942
Flight was delayed  Ok  time to sit down and have breakfast  Should have picked better  My mommy told me if you cant say anything nice  dont say anything at all  I normally go by that rule  But this place was fantastically awful Corned beef hash and eggs  No poached eggs We cant do that  Hmm Pan  water  real egg   ok  sure you cant  Eggs any other way you want them  Over easy  over medium  over hard  scrambled  Sure  over easy  Our Hash is not home made  Ok  it can still be good  NOT  Whoever was cooking cant even make an egg  Hash was right out of a luke warm steamer tray  Slow service  cold coffee  sticky tables  Its just not that hard people! Whoever owns these places needs to stop in and try a meal here some time  Im sure they havent in a long while  I fly often so I come to the airport a lot  Do yourself a favor and keep going  Even with a lowered bar for airport food  one star  Way better choices not a long walk away ,negative,1192154
My wife and brother and wife went here again on Saturday after a long bike ride  Once again it didnt disappoint  We sat outside in the little roped off area next to the street  Our waitress was extremely nice and attentive  I ordered a vodka tonic and a side salad and we split the caprese pizza  This is a must try and one of my favorite pizzas  It has garlic  mozzarella  tomato  and basil  Its simple but delicious  It was cooked to perfection in their brick oven  The side salad was large and very tasty  What we like is Shady Grove always has some drink specials  Great food  service  and vibe  This is a must stop in Shadyside ,positive,3836882
The food here had several unique twists on modern breakfast  The brunch cocktails were delicious  I suggest the eggs and bacon cocktail  I would give 5 stars  but one of the dishes showed up later than the others and was cold  We did not have them remake it due to our schedule ,positive,4842569

We had a great experience here! We needed a cheap table for our new place (we werent going to be there long) and we walked in  saw a final sale for a table that was $199 for 4 chairs and bar height tablewe were sold! Picked it up the same day  Loved that we werent harpooned to buy the minute we walked in and how easy they made it on us  Definitely recommend going here ,positive,6008024
 Their smoothies are DELICIOUS! I love the green smoothie (kale  avocado  yogurt) Rice bowls are OK   the noodle bowls are a horrible  clumpy mess ,neutral,22892
LOVE this place  so glad some friends of mine introduced me to it   They are frequent visitors and had been telling me I needed to try it   I finally went with them last week and boy am I happy I did   Our waitress was the owners daughter and treated us like family (probably b/c they are regular visitors)   We ordered a pretty wide variety of food and everything was delicious   I personally enjoyed the Summer Rolls  the tuna & mango sushi roll  and mango sticky rice!  I would highly recommend all of the above   Everything was super fresh and made as soon as we ordered   The spot is pretty small  just a narrow space  maybe 10 tables and seats at the counter   Everyone was friendly and greeted us right as we walked in   I will definitely be going back many times in the future and hope to try something different every time!,positive,3385558
Ok  The Monday following the review  the customer service representative called me  The rep was cordial  polite and understood my situation with the time constraint and quality that I was seeking with the products  After a 20 minute conversation  the representative saw to it that I was either given replacements or refund  I have to say  that I was not expecting that at all  With this in mind  I found that Mirror Mate stand behind their products 100%  Satisfaction is guaranteed !,positive,4018939

Nightmare shopping at Walmart on Sunday night around 8pm  Due to shortage staff in cashier I have to wait in line at least an hour  When it almost near the cashier  the manager on duty decide to closed the line in front of me  Overall  Im not satisfied of attitude of her explanation  Which I could understand the shortage of staff and worked overtime  But her attitude just snap out my patience waiting for an hour line up ,negative,3899021
Cool vibe  Loud  Very loud  But good seating  There is an outside patio  Bartenders did well  Loved the Power Salad with Steak  Cooked to my desire  Salad portion was light but steak plentiful  All good  Nice vinaigrette  I liked the wine I selected  They offered a taste  Washington State Disruption Cab  Good body  Menus not huge but probably works for most  Would come back ,positive,775493
My friend and I were looking forward to some out of the ordinary oils and vinegars  We stood around  browsed  read many labels  tried making eye contact with an employee but no luck in the first room   Tried again in the next room   same thing  No tastes for us  no purchase for us  no sale!,negative,3733263
Mastros is a classic steak house with expectations of classic service   I went there to order my favorite drink  a classic Manhattan   However  I was taken back when the bartender started shaking my drink like a Margarita at a sports bar   It was completely watered down and not blended   $22 for a poorly prepared drink where I have to instruct the staff in how to make it properly leaves me feeling ripped off   The bartenders need more training if Mastros wants to maintain their image   Also  the onion rings were large hunks of onion with a doughy batter and no flavor  For the price point  there are much better restaurants in Scottsdale ,negative,3586198
Great price for the services  I got a shellac Mani and regular pedi for $70!

I have used Say It In Signs for years  Scott always returns calls or responds to emails quickly  Great price and excellent quality  I used them more than once which says a lot  Scott shows you mockups of what youre getting so there no surprises  In one of my cases  I had changes and there was no up charge or delay  Fast work and you dont have to keep after this company to get the job done in a timely manner  I wouldnt hesitate to use their services again and you dont have to worry either ,positive,2292719
Ive been to the Sewickley Cafe multiple times   One of my mothers friends likes to frequent there often  but recently the service has really been slipping   This week  we went there for lunch and the place was virtually empty with only about a fourth of the tables inside occupied   Even though they didnt have their hands full  the service moved at a snails pace and offered very little concern for their customers   In concern of the food  it was fine  but as always the Sewickley Cafe is an expensive lunch   In my opinion  its a bit overpriced for what you get   This last time their trademark tomato dill soup even was a bit off and had a very oily flavor   My mother and I were really displeased with our past experience here ,negative,3026287
We just received our annual FAKE invoice from the SCAMMERS at Domain Listings  despite our previous requests to be removed from their fake invoice mailing list They purposely create a bill that appears to be legitimate   They do not answer phone calls or emails or respond to mailed requests to be removed from their list   Beware of this unethical dishonest fake business ,negative,6058819

This place is enormous! Its kept clean and safe two extremely important things to me  There are pools and other activities to partake in but in the winter we didnt use them  Maybe if we decide to come back in the Spring/ Summer we would definitely us it  Its quiet and the restrooms have single showers  They are kept clean and the pressure and temperature is nice  There is a security person at the entrance 24/7 which I think is top notch! We will be back!,positive,5465049
I worked an event in Tempe Marketplace for 12 hours and on both of my breaks I went to Kabuki for my meals  The lunch special was a really good deal for all the food you get; I ordered the beef sukiyaki  Huge bowl! For my second meal I had less time so I just ordered take out  the hibachi rice  Really yummy and filled me up for the time being  Very nice server too  Zach  thank you!,positive,2859112

I was looking for a poutine while I was shopping at eaton center  I found that place called NYF Poutinerie  so I decided to give it a try  The decision was a mistake  Iam from Montreal and so truly know what a poutine looks like and this was far from being one For the regular poutine I had pretty small size   they then put a smal amount of cheese wich was not the original one ( fromage en grain) it was just cottage cheese    Abeurk    Then they add an enormous amount of dark and thick sauce wich is closer to unitedstates culture than Quebecs culture  Oh and the sauce had a weird chocolate taste    Really the worst poutine I ever had  Cant believe they have a logo sayin : Poutine perfected since 1989  it is a shame ,negative,2740962
Amazing apple dumpling and apple pocket!    Cute little place   Great service and reasonable prices!  My husband and I will be back  and back    :),positive,266361
Took kids here for the first time  food was good  service was good  was a nice time Both my girls are their entire meal  a hot dog and pasta  They are picky eaters  When they clean their plates  desert is in order  They ordered a brownie sundae  the waitress actually advised is to get 1 because of the size  Most places dont care if there is waste  This made me happy that one cared enough to suggest this  Pulled pork was great  my wife had the fajitas  she really enjoyed!,positive,5697836

Well I thought this place was pretty cool really enjopyed nibbling on calamari and sipping their house white wine  Think it was a chardonnay or moscato  Well my review my not be 100% accuarte as I was a bit drunk and was craving some late night sober me up food  Again while most times late night sober me up food means street dogs or drive thru I was feeling a little more in a classy mood so suggested to my friend that we try it out  We sat in the patio area and was not really busy just a handfull of people in there  Service seemd ok not the best or anything special but decent  Would I return? Yea maybe why not  Most people on here seem to have less than possitive things to say about this place but meh ,neutral,6195673
Totally cant beat the price $21!!!I am used to paying more for not even close the type of quality service I get here  So I always make sure to tip well  These guys are pros! Location is worth driving to from my place  Parking isnt the easiest thing during peak hours in the area but you can park across the street which was an easy fix for me  I went wanting a dfferent style from what I originally had and left 100% stoked with what Alex did  I said I was open to different styles  we talked for a bit and he ended up giving me somehting that I loved and am going to stick to for awhile Random awesomeness: I had 3 complements from 3 very attractive girls that night Verdict: Go here    and bring the boys with you ,positive,5710171
I love Raising Canes!This specific location holds a special place in my heart since this is where I first tried Canes years ago  There is always a crowd when I go here but it has seemed to become less and less of a crowd since theyve opened so many locations now Service is fast and friendly  chicken strips are always good  place is always clean  no complaints here!While youre over here make sure to visit the Welcome to Las Vegas sign!,positive,2384726
This place is a joke  will just fill you up on meds and ignore any of your concerns     the male Hispanic nurse is a moron too he will cut you off while youre trying to express your concerns  Better off laying in the dark at home and suffering ,negative,5428599
As a regular in the ETA Lounge Im probably biased but Ive always loved the decor and the staff   On the weekend they have a DJ and a couple gogo dancers   Sometimes its a little slow but its always a great place to just have a drink and sit with friends  The gambling aint terrible  Too bad there isnt food served at the bar but they allow you to bring some in from the food court if you want   They make some great drinks overall  Some may experience a touchy staff person or two and I have firsthand witnessed it   Generally speaking if you run into someone in service thats annoyed then dont tip and move on   Unfortunately sometimes people like to exchange words and that works two ways But if you get a chance to check out the Lounge I recommend it ,positive,345562
Came for breakfast a little while back and it was pretty good! Everything looked renovated and remodeled since the last time I came which like 10 years back  The food isnt to fancy or luxurious but for a good grub sesh this place hit the spot  I had a fully loaded omelette from there omelette bar  country fried steak  huevos rancheros  chicken with peppers and loads of other great grub food  The buffet is very casual and not upscale at all so dont come here looking to impress a hot date or nothing  Also for dessert they had crepe bar which was great aswell  At the end of the day the buffet kept me fulfilled all the way back to LA ,positive,636871
Excellent chopped salad   really unique blend of ingredients   Another person at the table said burger was one of the best hes had   Didnt taste like airport food and very fast service ,positive,1031434
The food was super tasty! The staff was super nice and the whole atmosphere of the restaurant was very chill  Its a smidge on the pricier side  but they do give you a LOT of food  The fries could have been a little better but its my fault for not ordering the Greek variant  Other than that  everything was great!,positive,4889968
This aint your average taco joint  They have several in San Diego and when we saw it in Las Vegas  we just had to go in  This place does not disappoint  Their tacos are about as Mexican as it gets  Their salsas    delicious  and dont forget to ask for some grilled onions  Squeeze a little lime on them and enjoy  Compaired to the high priced gruel youll get at some of the casinos  this place is heaven  and very inexpensive  This is one not to miss ,positive,5163356
If there was a no star review this is what I would give this place  I am a native of az and have pretty much eaten at the local good spots  However  was in a rush with a friend  The food was literally sitting in some goo sauce that was flavorless  Its by fare the worst Chinese food place around  Dont waste your money,negative,3113080
I always tell myself for about the last year every time I go to Del Taco that they will change to be good again  BUT NO! As a regular I am over this at this point  I have to say something hoping it may change their portion habits  You know this trend is happening more and more with these fast food chains! I Ordered REGULAR tacos with meat from Del Taco today ate 2 bites and was wondering if their was meat in my taco  instead I got a lettuce taco with 9 strings of cheese  This isnt the first time with you Del taco ,negative,1838763

The sandwiches here are SO good  Ive always liked them but being pregnant  let me tell you I crave them pretty much everyday  I have to say the buffalo chicken sandwich is my favorite because eating deli meat is not on my menu right now  But the turkey sandwich is also so good  I order from them on Doordash too and Ive never been disappointed  I also think the chocolate chip cookies are one probably in the top 5 Ive ever had  I would give more stars if I could  I love this place!,positive,4990221
Pleasantly surprised with how good this place was  The carne asada fries really hit the spot  We really liked their hot sauces as well  Their medium sauce is the best hot sauce Ive ever had  It can take several minutes to get your food but thats because they cook it fresh to order  Really glad we stopped in to eat here ,positive,4214907
Visited Mi Casa for the first time  My husband and I loved it!!!

Been to most of the Asian/Oriental Markets here and found this one to be pretty good in terms of crossing off items on my Asian grocery list Asiana carries a majority of Korean items though they surprisingly sell Eastern European  Indian  Filipino and Chinese food as well  From fresh produce  prepared foods  seafood  meats  poulty  frozen seafood/meats & desserts  housewares  instant ramen and cosmetics this place pretty much has it all  Their produce looks decently fresh and I grabbed some staple seasonings for cooking as well as snacks and freshly made Kimbap Walked out with two bags for around $24  I guess the cost runs along the same lines as shopping at Trader Joes  Though some items here are pretty pricey for its worth  saw a can of Corned Beef for $6 99  thats crazy talk!Otherwise  clean store  doesnt smell too weird inside  check out is fast and items are easy to locate by aisles  Ill be coming back here!,positive,483208

SHHHHHHHHH   It is a secret!Seriously  It is a FN secret! The fact that there are over 2000 reviews tells me another 2000 plus people probably could not find it! We barely did! And when we asked one of the hostesses on the 3rd floor where it was  she had this I AM SO SICK OF THIS QUESTION look all over her face! But we did it!! And let me tell you    it is worth the adventure!Honestly the closest to a true New York slice I have ever had! I KNOW! That is a statement I do not make lightly! It was great!The white slice was the clear winner for me! Dont be intimidated by the big glops of cheese on it  it is super delicious! The pepperoni was really good too!!

My wife stopped in here last week and told me they have the shirts that I like for like $12 a piece She was right  I was skeptical about heading into Fiesta mall  but this Dillards is dirt dirt cheap  If youre a older gentlemen that likes colorful golf clothes and suits      this is your place  I picked up 2 long sleeve flannel shirts for cheap  Suits  golf clothes  old man shorts  polo shirts       CHEAP Not much in the way for a younger generation  but again CHEAP!!,neutral,3839724
This is where we have our Navratri Festival three weekends from 9:30p  2:30am for the past decade  Their facility and service have improved a lot in last couple of years  They have more lights out side as well as in the parking lot which is needed for the security of all three thousand people attending it  They have even improved police patrol and having several police offices outside  It males me feel lot safer seeing police out in the parking lot leaving at midnight around 2:30am  They still need to improve a little on the cleanliness of the facility overall but they came long way compare to where they were when we started using this facility way back in 1990s ,positive,5361684

Smoothies are the best yet!!!

(1) You played House with Hip Hop  You already win in my book (2) The fact that you have ample seating for the people that didnt spend a thousand plus dollars on table service is awesome (3) You have a flipping pool too?!

Thanks to another fellow Yelper who referred me to this place   If you are looking for a full bodied  salad and with hundreds of fresh combinations this is the place  You have the ability to select from a wide variety of fresh lettuce  vegetables  fruits and beans  Everything is fresh   The salad is prepared in front view while chopping everything into small bite size pieces  There are too many dressing to choose from to list but it defiantly has something to shock those taste buds  Staff is friendly and quick however; be prepared to stand in line as the place is packed  Treat yourself to something healthy yet satisfying ,positive,4717844

Parks Heating and Cooling is perfect for our family as we set it up as a set it and forget it kind of service  They call us to schedule appointments when its time to service our heating/AC  they are in and out quickly and quietly  There technicians are honest (the last one told us our filter wasnt dirty enough to change and showed it to me to prove it) and polite  I would recommend!,positive,4177424
AMAZING! I cant reiterate this enough    it is AMAZING!

The smell alone is enough to lure you inside   The pulled pork sandwich was great   Bryans offers a regular and a spicy BBQ sauce   The brisket chili is delicious and the cowboy beans are tasty   Both of my friends said their half slabs of ribs were good but not they best theyve ever had   The bummer?  NO MACARONI AND CHEESE ON THE MENU!  You gotta be outta your mind to develop a BBQ menu without macaroni and cheese on it ,neutral,5011711

Hmmm I hate when people just rip on a chefs work from ordering only one thing    Plus lady all u ordered was the Chinese version of chicken nuggets if u want nuggets go to mc Donalds      I orderd a good variety of food things that I use to judge the quality of the restaurant and things I can make myself but am to lazy to do      The Singapore mei fun the spring roll and wonton soup was good the shrimp and lobster sauce was more soup then sauce needs work     Also didnt help u got my egg rolls turned into spring rolls luckily they were good      If your mad at Chinese American food be mad at America because Chinese food was perfect the way it was       Thats why I stay Going to Chinatown downtown almost any resturant past e30th between st Clair and Payne     Enjoy,neutral,1747260

I simply came to this facility for a quarterly teeth cleaning  However  after my teeth were  xrayed  Dr  Ervin Calvos high pressure sales assault made me feel like a hostage at a used car lot or pushy timeshare resort  Ervin generated and presented  me with a $9 000 bill for dental work he recommended  I declined  but agreed to schedule to have two cavities repaired  Then while I was still in the dental chair the receptionist requested I prepay $98 00 for the work  before she would make my next appointment    All I initially wanted was a teeth cleaning  Had I not been Old School  Dr  Ervin would have charged me over $10 000   Nice staff and facility  I will not go back ,negative,2596144

Such a cute little restaurant with friendly workers! They greet you as soon as the door rings when it opens and as soon as you get up from your seat to leave  Firstly they serve you with salad  congee & miso soup  then they bring ice water & tea  I got myself a Salmon Bibimbap (rice  vegetables  salmon  egg  & spicy sauce) served on a hot stone bowl & my boyfriend got himself a Beef Bulgogi (bento box served with japchae noodles  raddish  steamed rice  beef bulgogi  & 1 salmon maki roll & 1 spicy salmon maki roll)  We also got a side of a Red Dragon Roll (raw salmon on top  shrimp tempura  cucumber  avocado  tobiko & a sauce on the bottom)  The prices are made by the options given on the menu  although they allowed me to make substitutions for reasonable up charges which I chose to do  Overall I had a great experience with a great view from my table  I highly suggest this restaurant if you are craving for sushi & are avoiding AYCE!,positive,4629735
Hi we used Artsy Nannies recently for the fourth time since my first review in 2008   We actually were in the town square having dinner and noticed the shop and popped in   Andrea remembered our son from watching him five years ago!  We booked a night at the store for our son to play and then another night at our hotel   Both nights he had a blast  he asked to go back every night Pat was our sitter for the hotel night   she arrived 20 minutes early and quickly connected with our son   Our son enjoyed the night and we enjoyed a night out without any worry    Call Artsy Nannies if you are in Vegas with kids they are the best   Want to see something like this in DC would love it!,positive,1736361

I came here for lunch on a Saturday with a friend  Unlike some of the other reviewers  I found the service to be quite good  though the restaurant was only about a third full at the time  The menu features traditional Vietnamese fare with a little Dim Sum thrown in  For an appetizer  my friend and I split the steamed chicken feet and the grilled shrimp on sugarcane (Chao Tom)  Both were excellent the chicken feet had the perfect soft  noodlelike texture and was paired with a sweet and savory sauce  The grilled shrimp was the perfect mix of smoky and sweet  and the added bonus of chewing on the sugarcane was definitely a plus  For the mains  we both had pho  which was a little disappointing  The meat was fine  but the broth lacked flavor and the noodles were a little overcooked and mushy  For this reason  Saigon rates as a 4 instead of a 5 in my book  Its still a solid pick and I look forward to hitting it up again next time Im in town ,positive,1929470
The worst service  Such a long wait for anything! Even coffee! Dirty inside and the wheelchair accessible doesnt seem to be ever working  Unpleasant staff that cannot handle requests like no mustard on a hamburger  Seemed to annoyed by everything  Disappointed every time I make the mistake of go there ,negative,5052815

So I think I liked this Bier Markt better than the one on King Street   It sort of looks like a castle on the inside and the outdoor patio made for a nice afternoon stop   Great selection of beers from around the world   I ordered the sausage sampler and some frites; pretty good  not the best Ive had   It gets a little pricy  though ,positive,4479637
We walked in and were told to sit at a booth in the back  The place has nice aesthetics and is pretty dark (we went at night!)  The server came up to us almost immediately to hand us menus  Quickly after  we ordered drinks I enjoyed the desert dragon  It had flowers and other toppings  It was pretty sweet! A little too sweet for my taste  The two people I went with enjoyed their drinks  Overall  nice place to stop for a drink or 2  Considering the price  I would suggest just 1 or 2!,positive,6130363
The place had great ambience   wings were nice with a twist but nothing extraordinary abt them   Cucumber melon punch bowl was 5 stars but Jameson ginger cocktail had way too much sugar  overall a good exp but like to visit other places in Vegas rather than coming back here  ,neutral,4963396
I had a horrible experience  I was trying to find the Instax mini 8 instant camera and after walking up and down each isle for 15 minutes (I could not find anyone to help me) I asked the person at the sewing machines if she knew where the cameras could be  She told me This is a craft store  they dont sell those here I told her that according to the store website that is they did in fact sell them in store  She then sharply told me that In store and online are different I told her I knew that  and she rolled her eyes at me  I then went to the cutting table as that was the only place I saw staff other than the register  and I was told that they were in scrap booking  I looked high and low in scrapbook but I had no luck and decided to go to the front register to get help  Cheryl was so nice  and she is the only reason to give this place a star  I was very disappointed in the whole trip  Cheryl was very sweet and helped me find the camera herself ,negative,2114925

Excellent service and excellent food  What else does one expect from a GR establishment  Our party raved about the Portabello Burger; the burger with the runny egg (done to perfection)  and the creme brulee shake  I had the fish and chip burger which was very good ( cant help myself; I compare fish and chips to McMullens  3 miles away  and everyone else comes up short)  Id also like to suggest the white sangria  which is turning into a summer favorite Its been awhile since I have been to GR Brgr; Im sure I wont wait since long for my next visit ,positive,1052075
Our first time here  They did an excellent job for our party of four at dinner  Wonderful service  generous wine and drink pours  Each of our various entries were perfectly prepared  Prices are reasonable We ate outside and enjoyed the fabulous fountain  The inside looked nicely decorated  We used to live in the area and frequented the Forum Shops  This is a nice addition to the shops Tourists do not be afraid!

Came with a group of 8 and we were seated within about 10 minutes  so not bad at all  The food is incredibly varied and tastes more like a restaurant than a buffet  which is great  I tried most of the meats; loved that they cooked it and cut it medium rare as I asked  The breakfast cheese parfaits and eggs Benedict impressed me a lot  Highlight was probably the service  Blanca was quick in servicing our table  kept our orders correct  and was just really friendly with a genuine smile  Highly recommend ,positive,696166

Had a great experience with Roger Campbell We were referred to him by a friend since we were in the market for a used car He made the whole experience painless and even jumped a few hoops for us trying to get us the car we had in mind We came with a paper of what models/color were in stock at the time and he made sure to go get them and we even drove to another lot to look at different year and colors of that model We left that day with a 2012 used toyota corolla!He actually changed my opinion on car dealers and dealerships ,positive,1632321

UPDATE: The next day  Jim called me back and left a message saying that he wanted to talk and that he saw my review on yelp  Then the next day  one of the owners also called me to discuss the bad experience  When I returned her call  she was incredibly considerate and very apologetic for the way things went  I really appreciated the extra effort she made and will absolutely give Midwood Smokehouse another shot  After all  the food WAS really great ,neutral,5750800
I love Milos! Whether its in Miami  New York City and here in Montreal  The food is just unbelievable  I always get the salted fish whenever I go here and you will never regret it! For those of you who do not eat fish  you are missing a lot in this life and I believe if you try this one you will change your mind and will begin eating fish  The fried zucchini is a must! I know I said fried and not all of us eat fried  This one is different  the crispness and the subtle sweet taste will cover the sin Romanesco is one of my favorite vegetable  its like youre eating cauliflower and broccoli in one! The way they prepared this dish seem so simple and fresh with a touch of garlic  salt and pepper and yet so delicious  Key lime pie is also my favorite dessert and here they make a super smooth and creamy one and perfect crust as well  Overall  not even a tiny morsel left on the plate!,positive,2382415
Came in  sat at the bar  tried to order a beer   Bartender didnt have the proper drink menu   Took him about five minutes to show the proper menu   Drinks are ordered and given to us   Didnt check on our status at all (e g   how are the beers  need a refill)   Overall  a horrible experience   No need to waste time here when there are so many other better choices  all of which have so much better service   To be fair  the bartender could have just been a jerk ,negative,689547

this place is an all you can eat sushi restaurant  You use iPad to order and everything is served to youThis place is not worth it to be honest  The sushi was okay but the wrapper was so hard to chew  The other items were so boring and you got tired of it  The fried race was SO OILY that it stuck onto my sisters face  The dynamite roll was honestly the highlight of the food  Also the tiramisu was tiny but pretty good The reason this gets 1 stars is because the service is terrible  They gave me water 1 the whole time I was there  They were a bit slow in confirming the orders  I AM SO PEEVED because the orders come out INCREDIBLY SLOW  I literally ordered one the hand roll when we first got there and it came out 50 minutes later  This happened more than once The washroom was very nice but had no tissue  Restaurant itself is dirty  I will come back because I love sushi that is in big amounts  But I hope I find another place because this is very terrible,negative,6645692

Came here and met with Rusty  A friend of mine is looking for a mortgage and since I was in the biz for years  I came along to ask some questions too Rusty was friendly and on point  We discussed the needs and he was able to find a program for my friend  I thought he was very professional and his company fees were extrememly reasonable! If and when the time comes and I want to buy a home again  I will come here  There are a lot of shady brokers out there and Rusty isnt one of them Ill post an update as to how it went but for now  Im definitely a fan!,positive,642218
Wish I could give 0 stars  Consistently gets order wrong  They are so quick to throw your food at you that if they took a few extra minutes to look at what they were preparing they may get the order right  Food no longer tastes good either  Will drive to a farther Wendys out of my way just to get a correct order ,negative,6405640
I have nothing bad to say about Nordstrom ESPECIALLY the one in Fashion Square Scottsdale  They always have the best customer service and friendly staff!I love the great finds here  even in the Juniors section for us small girls/ladies!The only thing is that I wish their highend shoe department sold more highend shoes  common Louboutins!!!,positive,2268394
Read all the glowing reviews and was excited to come here   Sorry  it was a real letdown   While the food presentation was good  the food quality itself was extremely substandard  and most of the items were not hot  and were either overseasoned and salty  or rather tasteless   The meat station items looked good  but the meat quality was poor  and the meat was so tough and salty that it was unedible   All of the items with very few exceptions reminded me of an expensive version of Hometown Buffet   The best station was the Italian items  and that isnt saying much   If you know the difference between good food and mediocre food  do not waste your time here   If you do not have developed tastes  then you will likely enjoy yourself   I rate this as one of the great culinary disappointments in my dining experiences in Las Vegas ,negative,4289742

Realize that your nice car is in the hands of teenagers and poor management  My car was hit by a worker driving another customers car  They didnt tell him until he came to check on his car that it was involved in an accident  They completely ignored me and wouldnt answer my questions even though the worker said he didnt see me and it was an accident  I was very calm because I know accidents happen so I wasnt giving them a hard time  I never got a follow up call from the management and I got a lot of attitude from their general manager Teresa when I called to follow up on what was going on  I was assured that Id be contacted after the investigation and it has been 2 months with no word  Furthermore  their insurance is sketchy and is avoiding my insurance company  You are risking your nice car with this badly run establishment ,negative,4292262

This theater is cool!!! We didnt realize this was AMC and inadvertently brought our Harkins cups  They still allowed us to use them for free water  and they have the selfserve soda machines like fastfood restaurants do  You get to choose your seats before you go in  and the theaters have recliners! All I need now is a quilt from home (but then Id probably fall asleep)!,positive,5607406
We went to Anthonys for the first time  We sat at the bar and the service was great  I did not care for my Italian roast beef sandwich  and my partners calzone was a blob of melted cheese stuffed in a big piece of baked bread  Everything tasted bland  I was disappointed with the very limited menu ,neutral,6147697
Ive never really liked this place   The gaming area is small and the lackluster rooms leave much to be desired   The pinstriping everywhere makes me dizzy and completely irritates the shit out of me Ill reserve the 1 star rating for some other places down the street  because even though I hate this place      it could be worse   That second star could easily be a half  though Stay somewhere else  even if the room is compd ,negative,3064158
T G I  Fridays at Monroeville thought it was appropriate to give me another persons hardly touched meal in a clean bowl   A big group of us went to dinner   My husband and I are vegan  so we did our best to not be difficult and chose the kids pasta as our meal   Because our party was so large  my pasta came out first and they lost my husbands order and had to make a new one   So my pasta comes out in a bowl pre mixed and with a spoon in it   I thought nothing of it because I was starving so I ate it   When I finished  my husbands pasta came out completely different then what was presented to me  He had pasta in a bowl with marinara poured on top  Nothing was pre mixed no spoon in it   Thats when I knew they gave me another childs meal that was hardy touched   THANK T G I  Fridays!,negative,4667258

On the inside you have somewhat of a disco vibe or something like that going on    I am really not sure how to describe it but it is  interesting    Most importantly the beer is good! There are enough choices that theres something for every palate  There is plenty of space and even some cumphy couches and chairs  It is a big space but very little light  some sky lights would really make it feel better  Also:: if the man and woman running around back in the brewery area and in and out were employees let alone the owners    you should try to at least say hello to the only people sitting at your bar! Or try not to come off so cold    actually though to me the whole placed seemed a bit cold and I dont me temperature    except the bartender    she was just wonderful  even though she said she was new  She was just great  We will definitely be back  I think they just opened so Hopefully it will just get better from here out ,positive,4046053
First off  the food is always great  Its so good  But what made this experience wonderful is JAMIE  She was very nice and professional  Made our dinner well worth it,positive,1142739
The server was not very nice until the very end and she kept disappearing for 1015 minutes at a time when we were trying to order  We stopped in for a snack and drinks midday  We had the happy hour margaritas for $5 each and they were OK  it was way too heavy on the sweet and sour mix but what do you expect for a $5 drink I suppose  We also ordered the quesadilla off the appetizer menu to share and chips & salsa  The chips were kind of hard  but the salsa was good  The quesadilla was more of an empanada  but it was delicious Maybe wed give it another try if were back in the shops there ,neutral,4993071
I really enjoy this place  and split my time between this location and the one on college  Both are great  but this one has a bit more space (if thats your thing)  The prices are incredibly reasonable ($2 50 for a cappuccino  for example)  and unlike other places  you do not get charged an extra 5075 cents for nondairy milk  The coffee is great  the barristas are great (especially when they play Fleetwood Mac)  On weekends  the owners parents make tasty hand pies  definitely try one out! There are a few outlets  but they are a little awkward to get to  but I think thats fine    One negative thing other reviewers keep saying is they dont like the noise of kids  I have to say  even as someone without kids  I enjoy that its a child friendly place because my friends with kids/babies feel welcome here  And really  if you want more quiet  the Gladstone library is a 2 min walk away ,positive,2540384

I have used this co  In the past which is the reason I used their services last week to move into our new home   Alicia in their office is just about the nicest person to interact with I can imagine   There were 5 GENTLEMEN moving our possessions from 3 different locations   They worked about 13 hours   On time  courteous  professional and the list goes on   Lots of HEAVY items and a 3 level home   NOT A SINGLE SCRATCH ON ANY WALL   not that I really would have cared David  nick  Tj  Demarcus and Ryan should certainly be commended   Just the kind of men you want in your home and would love to hang out and have a beer with I hope I never have to move again but if I do these are my guys!  I know this review sounds like I am the owners brother but this is as genuine as it gets folks   Anyone can even call me for anything further if they want Andy gervase 4802448056,positive,2293616
This place is so good! A little bit of a wait for a Friday evening was to be expected  you can enjoy a drink while you wait or walk down to the food truck court across from Barrio Queen and wander on Friday nights  They text you when your table is ready which is awesome! Prosciutto with Brie panini is to die for  great combo of salty and sweet  Our server was great and attentive  he made an effort to engage in conversation and was very helpful with questions about the menu  The wine I selected was a little bitter  maybe just a bad bottle? I cant wait to go back!,positive,5509303
Food was delicious but the service was kind of annoying  We asked for salt and the waiter insisted that we eat some of our food before he would bring us salt  I understand that in many restaurants they want you to try the food the way it is prepared before you season it yourself  but I really hate it when a waiter tries to tell me how to eat my dinner The waiter kept telling us how good the blood sausage is and that it is what they are famous for and I guess if you like blood sausage it is good  but I just dont like blood sausage Our food was great overall but waiters who dont bring you salt when you ask for it should be fired  You are a waiter  not a food eating instructor  This is not the first meal I have eaten  bring me what I want and go away ,positive,1223748

The food was terrific  the atmosphere was nice albeit a little loud  the serving sizes were big (the pasta dishes could easily be shared by 2 people)  and the servers were prompt and attentive   The pasta with chicken  pine nuts and pesto sauce was delicious   Also  the pasta dish with tomato sauce  sausage  and maybe some veggies was tasty   Overall  would definitely go back  although maybe earlier in the evening or when its a little less busy so its not as loud ,positive,4890356
Personally I like this place a lot   They have pertty decent food   The hummus is good  the baba is good  the pita is fresh  the servers are kind and quick to fill up your drink  and I really enjoy their fallafel   Quantity is awesome   Not the highest of quality as far as ingredients go ,positive,4191477
This was one of the worst service experiences I have encountered  If I was at a Taco Bell I would be content but when you are paying $200 for a night out it should be a top notch experience  We were asked to flag me down when you are ready to order  Our reservations were at 8:45 and we were seated at 9:30   I will say the food was good  but I would spend your money and time elsewhere ,negative,5642879
Visiting from the Seattle area this restaurant has been our breakfast and sometimes lunch spot every day that weve been here  Food is good  the service is good  over all the give it a 5 stars which is rare  Good servers Mikey  Sylvia  and Niko  My fav    Caprese omelet ,positive,5878051
David Filter  the owner  couldnt be more accommodating or more pleasant to work with   English Garden is a gem   Their shop is large  clean  stocked with fresh  interesting flowers (um carnations and babies breath are not interesting flowers so if this is your idea of fancy  go over to Trop @ Maryland Parkway   )   He hires floral designers from all over the world who keep his designs interesting and creative   I count on him to keep my event florals top notch   Im not alone   Hes the goto florist for most of the celebs in town    Totally passionate about his business  good to his people  and his customers    Love love love English Garden!,positive,818159
The sushi and food was okay nothing memorable  The wait staff was friendly  It didnt look too busy that night  WE ordered 3 things at the beginning and didnt receive them till everyone in my party was done eating and ready to pay  When I told the server I had not received my okinomiyaki (Japanese pancake) and my cousins spam musubi and edamame she replied by saying oh gosh those things take a really long time to make  REALLY!! I had high hopes for this place and maybe Ill give them another chance ,neutral,5028262

My husband and I came for breakfast  which they serve all day  and we were not disappointed   I ordered a cappuccino and their Cafe Benedict   Oh my dear lord were these both delicious!!  My husband even said he has not seen me clean my plate like I did in a while   My husband had a coffee and their caramelized ham and cheese omelette  He enjoyed his pickings equally as much!  Both of our meals came with hash browns and my husbands also came with toast and two mini jars of jam   Service was great and everything came out pretty quickly   I highly recommend everyone to come to the Cafe Bellagio for breakfast at once during your stay in Las Vegas ,positive,3757263

Ive traveled around the world and been to many hot spots such as the party city of Ibiza  Rome  Florence  etc but this is the best night club ive ever been to  hands down!! I had bottle service and most definitely recommend it as it helps you skip the crazy lines to get in and the personnel is friendly and helpful! If your a party animal  inside is packed and crazy  If you still want to have a good time but have more space to move and talk with your friends  then I recommend the outdoor pool area  We had a pool side VIP seating with an amazing view of the DJ of the nightCalvin Harris rocked!!!,positive,3077373
If it were possible to give a zero star rating  I would  but the app requires a star   The staff  including the manager/owner (tall bald man) is incredibly rude   It is clear they do not want return business  and they will certainly never receive another penny from our family   If you are in Olmsted Falls and are in the mood for Mexican food  for your own good I urge you to drive a couple of miles into Berea and patronize Maya   The service and food at Maya are far superior!,negative,3109911

Heard that the original owners were back in the area and had opened in the location that formally hosted a Hot Dog on the Stick  You can easily pass it if you didnt know it was there already  but hopefully better signage is on the way  Service was friendly and quick through the drivethru and they offered an apple and a drink on the house with each sandwich  The most important part  the food   Good portions and fresh ingredients as weve grown to expect  The beef could use another shake or two of seasoning  Fries are packaged in a plastic to go container with no ventilation   BIG no no  They sweat and become soggy  I am sure some folks like that  but I prefer crispy fries  Overall  good meal and service  but probably better if you have the time to eat in ,positive,1723132
Basically this is the best place you can go for a breakfast sandwich  A Bob is a breakfast on a bun and it has bacon  old cheddar  mayo and hoisin on a bun  Its a guarantee your morning starts out with no temper tantrum  Exactly what you wanted and for a super cheap price   Coffee is great  But really the place is about the people working there  They remember your name  your order and they actually really like their customers  The two new owners are late twenties and best friends  You sort of get the sense you are going to go hang out with friends  I also seem to run into every writer and artist I know  Ready to stare at their laptops or take the occassional break and talk about their projects  This is the sort of place that can be your Toronto   I cant recommend it highly enough ,positive,447910
In my entire life  I have never seen a waiter complain about a tip upon receiving one until today  A friend visiting from Brazil wasnt clear of the tipping process in Canada and rounded up as they normally would due to habit   The old man outright threw a fit  I mentioned that I would explain the concept to my visiting friend to fix the problem as the service was great  but the waiter still wouldnt have it  He said he [the visitor] should know better and wouldnt listen to reason  We had great service until the last minute When he became rude and unprofessional  Not impressed  I should have asked him to refund the total tip altogether after that ungrateful nonsense  HERES A TIP; maybe you should leave the village at some point in your life and see how the rest of the world operates ,negative,3178684

Items ordered  starter  fresh humus and pita bread   entrees  Beef Shish Kabobs with fresh vegtables that included roasted jalapeno and the Frarej  a wonderful lemony roasted chicken with ripe tomatoes and potatoes basted in lemon  garlic and olive oil  Ill be honest I dont eat Mediterranean food often but I know good fresh food when I taste it  So when I see fresh steaming pita bread being served I started salivating and the humus was excellent  With the shish kabob the beef was tender and the veggies perfectly done  The chicken with the Frarej was tender  juicy and full of flavor  I must say if you dont care for lemon skip this dish but I loved it  Ive officially put Mediterranean food as a viable option when considering dinning out and Hedarys is the reason why ,positive,3283881

Im honestly unimpressed  I got their vegan gluten free mac n cheese and their falafel waffle  Spent $25 on food  and the mac n cheese was hard and dry and the cheese was almost completely dried up  The side salad was generous in portions but didnt taste like anything  not even the dressing  The falafel waffle was also dry and the accompanying veggies were undercooked   I had to get to work so I took the food with me and didnt have time to go talk to someone in the restaurant  unfortunately  I will say their baked goods are to dieeeee for  but the food? Waaaay too expensive to be paying that much for that quality of food  in my opinion  It was a $25 wasted ,negative,2924100
I had the Thin Man and a Leek and Bacon soup while I was here  and all I can say is WOWZA! Everyone is right about their special sauce  The delicious  quality food matched the delightful  friendly master chefs (and their mom!)  The atmosphere  staff  and food of this place will definitely keep me coming back for more affordably fantastic food ,positive,2154789
Came with friends because one of them recommended the house special 3 guys (grass jelly  pudding  & tapioca) milk tea  I debated between that and 2 ladies (pudding & tapioca) and ended up getting the latter  We had a good laugh at the strange drink names The drink itself was pretty good! On par with Chatime prices but I quite liked the pudding texture and flavour  The tapioca were nice and chewy and the milk tea wasnt watered down  I ordered 70% sugar and less ice  Just right to keep my drink cold but get my values worth of milk tea! I would definitely come here again when around the area!,positive,696339
Ordered the homemade meatball sub for lunch for take out   When i got back to the office  I opened the container and there were 3 meatballs on a piece of bread with some cheese and maybe  maybe some sauce    So dry   Still hoping for a tasty meatball  Nope   Like someone poured cups of sugar into it   Too sweet   Had a coworker try and he agreed  Bad   I called the restaurant and they explained that their meatballs are a family recipe and a little on the sweet side   Wow   I have no idea who would continue to eat these generation after generation ,negative,4116057
My husband and I went to TBones last night  we hadnt been there since my last written review   As much as we like the food and the place itself   we probably wont go back until they get rid of the weekend entertainment   He  is SO bad and its so LOUD!!!   Hard to believe no other complaints/comments about that on yelp??  We could hear people sitting at the bar complaining about how bad the guy in there is    Soo surprised hes still there!!

Another La Belle Province (this one IS part of the chain  not all are)  Typical La Belle Pronvince junk  hotdogs are okay  and the buns are from the IGA right across the street  The poutine is a dissapointment  Orangeish commercial mix  refrifrirated cheese curds  and thick unevenly cooked fries  I left frustrated  Visitors: PLEASE do not make this your first Poutine Extra star for making the design of this particular location a mix of a 50s diner and a space shuttle ,neutral,315547
I had the brunch this time (Not my first time here)  Definitely expensive ($13) for their brunch  Good variety of breakfast items  The pongal was amazing  Idly  Dosai were just the usual  The sambar was just OK (they should improve considering it is the primary side for bfast)  The gobi manchuria was amazing  The lunch items were OK (one snack  paratha  2 entrees & veg biryani)  Decent variety of desserts (the gulab jamun was perfect & this is another place that serves it hot)  Ordered Mango Lassi on the side & it was amazing! Final Verdict: I would visit this place again  provided  they improve their sambar!,positive,2156625
I came for the buy one get one free deal because Id like to support charities and they also gave a sandwich to charity for every one that you bought  The brunette girl who made my sandwich was very nice very sweet very professional she look like she actually liked her job  She made the sandwiches very neat because sometimes theyre just thrown together but that wasnt the case here  This location is right by my house and this was the first time Ive been there  Very pleasant experience!

Five star for the food but no star for the stinky toilet which reminds me of many places in China   Again  the dirtier the restroom  the better the food because it is being used   The food is definitely authentic and the prices are excellent   They even offered $9 95 for a Canadian Lobster which you will pay in north of $20 in a typical western restaurant   We ordered crab and it was excellent as well   Tofu  beef brisket (New Nan) were below par in my eyes   DO NOT ORDER FROM AMERICAN MENU   This is a chef from Hong Kong so if you like saucy food with light texture  you are in great hands ,positive,1188431

Had an amazing meal at Saturday Dinette  As with Hammersmiths before  the space is openconcept  cozy  and has a great vibe  Staff was attentive and friendly and the prices were very fair for the excellent food After sampling bite of every dish on the table  everyone in the group was thoroughly impressed with everything and we ate every last bite of food  The coconut milk mac and cheese was really delicious  There were lots of vegetarian options and extremely tempting side dishes  appetizers  and milkshakes!,positive,1644243
Oh  whats that? I love the Blakeney Bevello just as much as the SouthPark location? Shocker  Yup  ladies  this Bevello has a fabulous selection of tops  dresses  jeans and shoes all ripe for the picking  Plus  their customers service is top notch  these ladies are genuine and happy to help you find whatever you may be seeking  Dresses  pants  tops  sweaters  etc  Plus  prices are fair and the shop also features plenty of midrange brands that are trendy but modern to bring you from season to season  Theres also a nice selection of designer denim near the register   Dont forget to check out the shoes  including the Toms for adults and babies  Those little shoes make the best baby gifts!,positive,4002362
I really wanted to like this salon  as it is in the Downtown Summerlin mall  right next to nekter juice bar  I went in for a set of dip powder nails  and they took me fairly quickly  The bummer was  both technicians that worked on me were both rude  The lady (Juli) that started my nails worked very quickly  and sent me to a male technician (M J ) to finish  because she had an appointment coming in  Both nail techs groped and thrusted my hands around as they hurried me along  It was extremely uncomfortable  Neither one smiled either  It was like they both hated their jobs  Not the kind of relaxing experience youd want in a salon  They also seemed upset that I did not want a manicure along with my dip powder set  which took an astonishing 20 minutes max from start to finish  Ive never experienced such treatment in a nail salon  I wont be returning,negative,2563074

This past Wednesday as we were walking around Philips Place I noticed a new restaurant across from the Palm and we decided to check it out  Im glad that we did  We were seated in the bar area with a nice view of the fountain and to our surprise we had not one  but two servers  as one was in training  Stefan and Michael were extremely friendly and very helpful as it was our first visit  We ordered the chicken meatballs and a few salads along with some wine to start the evening off and we were not disappointed  the meatballs were tasty and the salads were crisp with great homemade dressing For dinner I went with the Scottish Salmon and my wife chose the Market Special  fresh shrimp over polenta with a marsala sauce  both were entrees that the server trainee suggested and we loved them  We didnt have time for desert  although it was suggetsed and sounded great  maybe next visit ,positive,5385866
We have used Freedom Animal hospital for years!!! The vets and staff have always been great in providing services for our pets   We use them for boarding as well   Great place to take our cat and dog for routine or unplanned checkups!  The Sat hours is a real plus as well ,positive,6050410

I tried this place 4 times  I was not impressed  I tried the pulled pork tacos the first time  It was dry and cold  I tried it because I love new ideas  Its cool to be creative  but it should taste good  The fish fry was terrible  I think someone made the tarter sauce and forgot to refrigerate it  I ended up saturating the fish with lemon to finish it  I think the worst part was the bartender  There is no way she was sober  She was just laughing obnoxiously  My friend that took me there was really excited until she tried her old fashioned  The cheesesteak was tough  I guess where else would you go in Oregon?,negative,2651775
So my fiance and I had dinner at this Outback and I just had to make this review  mostly regarding the service  We both thought it was strange that our server asked if my fiance wanted his Amstel Light in a bottle when that is the only way they serve it  Also I had asked for veggies as one of my sides and I got the baked potato so had to wait for my veggies a few more minutes after my meal got there  BUT my biggest complaint was that our server poured me my 2nd glass of wine  which was a different type of wine into the same glass that I already had been using  That is such poor Restaurant etiquette that I really wish I would have said something  Food was pretty good  I tried their lamb for the first time  It had a good flavor but it was very fatty ,neutral,4513554
I had there oxtail fries and I was not a fan you need to like it in order to enjoy it  I also had the pork belly and I was not sure if I did or didnt like them  But everyone tastes bugs are different we also had the kiki burger n that I loved so good  I would come here again when am in town but not get the fries nor the pork belly ,positive,2165260
This is the best jiffy lube Ive ever been to  The service was very quick  but also very thorough on inspecting my car   Customer service was outstanding   Jimmy was very knowledgeable  helpful and professional   Not sure if he is a manager  if he isnt he should be   Hannah was very friendly and courteous   I will only come to this jiffy lube because of the service I received   I highly recommend this jiffy lube ,positive,5335914
I recently started liking Superdrys jackets  Im not really sure where this newfound obsession came from  I like that theyre not that expensive but the quality still feels pretty decent  They had 30% off the entire store during Black Friday and afterwards The sizes run a bit small  so I would size up if youre not sure or are in between sizes Im currently wearing a Wind Attacker jacket and feel really comfortable in it  The collars are really high and stuff so its nice for you to rest your chin on it ,positive,2575107
We ordered a skillet with egg  shredded pork  beans  crispy corn tortillas topped with a red sauce which came with a side of sour cream and salsa  We also ordered French toast with bacon  Both plates were very good but the pork carnitas stole the show  I will go back for that dish!

Sibling Brewery needs to find someone else  Terrible service  Came in and asked how long they would be there  was told 9:00  Went out at 7:30 to place an order  was told she wasnt taking orders at that time  to come back in 10 min   (ok   )  My wife went back out at 8:00 and the woman in front of her was told that she would be the last order ,negative,4442803
The only thing good is the bread with oil and vinegar  Service sucks just as bad  Our waiter 2028 Michael who keeps disappearing  didnt even give us napkins  Its possible that they dont give good service because gratuaty is already added to your bill  I had a very salty spaghetti and meatballs and pizza  Food is waaaaay too salty,negative,4945942
very disappointed! I bought a groupon deal which was for *$16 50 for three Groupons  each valid for two Like It size createyourown treats with one mixin each ($28 14 value)  As I was taking it home for my family  I asked her if it would be possible to put the ice cream all in 1 container  She said sure  it will be about a quart  I asked her how much a quart of my familys favorite (raspberry sorbet  cheesecake & coconut & white choc chips)  She told me it would be about $8  What a ripoff! I paid $16 50 for a deal on a quart of ice cream valued at half the price?!?! Based on the groupon value of $28 14 I should have received close to 4 quarts  NO THANK YOU!,negative,6652348
I eat here all the time  Best Thai food ever  I found out about this place through Yelp last year and eat here as often as possible  The eating area is small and cozy  the food is great and the waitress is always smiling and kind  Its close to home making it easy for me to make a Thai food run  My first choice in Vegas ,positive,2039531
Wow! Chipotle aint got nothing on this place   The only thing I didnt like was having to choose a meat because they all tasted so good! (Sampled them all) there burrito is unbelievably gynormous and their meats carry authentic homemade flavor  You can tell a lot of love went into this food! Very fresh  very good and very large portions  Also  the Lucha libre theme is pretty hysterical! Love this place!!!,positive,6466261
I came as a walk in on Friday mid afternoon with my sister  It was packed  The wait was about 30 minutes  We were provided beverages while we waited  The staff was very apologetic  My sister did the mani pedi special for 38  I did a regular pedi and gel mani for 60  John  one of the technicians did acupressure during my pedicure which was very surprising twist  I will give this place another try  The decor was interesting  This place is under new management so things are scattered everywhere while they redecorate ,positive,1920641
The food was excellent  however the location is very run down  While the theme of this restaurant is a run down look  this location is even more run down than just in looks While the food would have us going back for more  not sure if the state of the restaurant would be something to subject ourselves to again  In need of some TLC ,neutral,4878055
Molisana bakery  Not too shabby  Came in here for a pastry and an espresso    Couldnt find the pastry but the espresso was decent  $2 per shot  It was long and hot and delicious  Did the trick  Probably wont be back to be honest  Its a bit out of the way for me and the parking lot is a little crazy  but the price is right and the flavour is on point  Just personal preferences  I did see they had a hot table which was happenin during lunch hour  Check it out!,neutral,3626069

Awful customer service! The employee was rude and condescending  She did not hear my order and when I corrected her she rolled her eyes and proceeded to talk about me to another employee while she fixed my order  Something along the lines of  she said this and now      she wants this! It was a simple mistake that could have been handled completely differently  I left without my order and will not be returning ,negative,419711
If you need service  Lisa Abbott is the person to see  I have been going here for ten years and was really upset when my previous service writer left  Lisa stepped into the breach and has made my life as or more comfortable  She is pleasant  professional  and is able to find every discount available  Prices are no more than she quotes  and many times less  She keeps track of the progress of my vehicle  and keeps me informed every step of the way  I trust her judgement  so if she recommends a repair or replacement  I listen  And  its not just Lisa! Mario  in the back  takes care of my vehicle as if its his own  I picked it up this last Wednesday  and I dont think it looked that good when it was new  I strongly recommend this business  Lisa & Mario!,positive,3142911

Neveen exceeded all of my expectations  She removed all of the stress from the process of buying my first home  She very patiently showed me several properties and gave me plenty of space to make my decision  She had a solution for every issue and provided me with all of the information I needed to complete the transaction smoothly  I would highly recommend her as your realtor!,positive,3854986
Greek Gyros is my goto spot when I want a healthy(ish) lunch near my office Their gyros are good but unremarkable  I dont mean that in a bad way  I just mean they dont stand out compared to other places in town  Their Dolmas are good  but I wasnt overly impressed with their hummus What I find myself ordering most often is their grilled chicken  either on a pita  salad or the plate (with rice and salad)  The seasoning is so flavorful and they grill it up to a juicy perfection  If you do order chicken though  be prepared to wait up to 10 minutes for it  as they are grilling it to order and it takes much longer for them to prepare than the gyros they churn out quickly ,positive,1610355
Dont go here  This is the heart of bad knowledge by employees  Manager is awesome  but his people have no idea how to treat a customer  Never again will I go to this branch  I wasted three hours of my time just to use my insurance that the guy wouldnt even help me figure out  What a waste of my precious time  Oh    and I called ahead of time to try an get on a waiting list or avoid going to the store    eventually  the automated system told me to come into the branch an hung up on me  I could go on and on about how bad this was     but there is no point  Verizon has now surpassed Qwest/Century Link for the worst service EVER One more point  dont use Asurion Insurance because they have no clue how to handle a claim  Verizon fail over and over ,negative,920130

Pho Hong is a new Vietnamese resturuarant in our neighborhood  Therefore  my girlfriend and I decided to give it a try Saturday night  We were blown away with both the quality and freshness of the food  and the friendliness of the staff  We both ordered the Bun Combination on the recommendation of our server  The vegetables were fresh and the meat was cooked to perfection resulting in an absolutely amazing dish! We were so ecstatic with how good it was that we decided to return again tonight  Once again  this place did not disappoint  We are so excited to dine here again  and venture out to try some new dishes ,positive,4195725

To be fair  Ive only been on the patio twice  and both times I loved the look of string lights at night    but the drinks and food are both quite mediocre here The fries were soft and mushy  and we had to pay EXTRA for butter for our bread  Overall  itll still a nice atmosphere to have a beer  but everything else is not enough to make me come back ,negative,5674510

Came on a Wednesday around 7:00pm  All the tables were full  You line up at the cash and order  get a number and wait for a table  Once one frees up they start your order I believe  although within minutes of sitting down we got our food  They were sold out of a bunch of stuff and were only offering half the menu at the time I was there  Pancakes were very good  I ordered the raspberry one but I wish there were more berries  Definitely worth a try but not sure I would return!,positive,690845

So yeah the gelato is good But $8 00 for a CHILD SIZE small ass scoop good? Hell to the NO  However   the irony here is that while all the reviews here read the same about ridiculously exhorbitant prices  lets face it  When you are out randomly walking around in the Forum Shops at Caesars and spot sparkly shiny gelato winking at you    you are not going to think to check Yelp  Or you might  but I would venture to say most wont So unfortunately  in a spur of the moment kind of purchase like this  all the 1 and 2 stars in the world on this place wont save a line of 20 people paying $8 00 for gelato  It didnt work for me   and yes there was a line Random note to those planning to check out Vegas    remember to check the price of something first  before you let your visual sweet tooth steer you into a ridiculously expensive treat  Or just walk away when they say eight bucks please ,negative,4528471

We used Grout Plus to clean and seal out Travertine tile and grout  It was a few years since we had it done and were concerned how clean could it really get   Don came out and gave us a quote  He explained the process and gave a very competitive price including a discount for mentioning Yelp and Angies list  Brandy and Omar were our techs  We have approximately 1500 square feet of 18 Travertine Tile and they worked very hard getting to look fantastic  Grout lines looked like new and the tile was excellent  Brandy also showed us how we may want to fill a few stone holes or spider cracks  They were helpful showing us the products they were using and made sure to be careful around our newly painted baseboard  We will use them again and refer them to friends  Thanks Don  Brandy and Omar!,positive,6121907

Originally founded in Pittsburgh in 1949 as one of the worlds first carhop restaurants  Eatn Park Restaurant is today pretty much like a Shoneys except in the architecture and appearance of most of its building  They kind of stand out in design having a 1950s look about them  but of course they no longer have any carhop service  This particular Eatn Park has both a buffet and table service  I elected for the table service ordering a cup of chili along with a cup of chili  Though I wasnt very impressed with the chili the may be because of my jaded tastes due to chili overexposure at some of the chili cookoffs I had recently attended  I was however impressed with their Reuben which contained generous slices of lean corn beef  tasty sauerkraut  Swiss cheese and Thousand Island dressing in between slices of fresh tasting rye bread; a sandwich I would recommend ,neutral,4120329
Our hotel room (masquerade tower  classic room) is HORRIBLE and a poor excuse for a suite  It looks like the room was placed on the renovation schedule and they started taking items out one at a time the shower head feels like an oversized spray bottle with lukewarm temperature water  the sink in the bathroom is leaking  no microwave  coffee maker missing (looks like it was supposed to be there and got unscrewed)  one of the lamps is falling off the base and flickering  there was an exposed socket with no cover  and to top all that off  they took nearly AN HOUR TO BRING OUR BAGS TO THE ROOM!,negative,4135371
For years  Ive heard how good this place it  Maybe I didnt order the right thing  but I wasnt that impressed  The garlic bread was good  very buttery  so if youre dieting beware  My lasagna was just ok  The salas was very good and I compliment their use of leaf lettuce  not plain old iceberg  Service  was pretty good  but I wish they would have come refilled drinks more often or had larger glasses ,neutral,1265163
Ive gotten both the gyro pita and bowl and they are both delicious  Meat tastes fresh and tzikii sauce is great  I would recommend take out  as restaurant is a bit hot inside with the weather and obviously all that cooking  Take note that you should specify that you want the $6 99 pita or bowl special  as the one on the regular menu is different price ,positive,3047098

This company is horrible!

Really a quality spa  especially considering the location  Although the spa is a little small the amenities really make it  When you come in you are offered fruit water in a glass not a little plastic cup  The linens used in the massage are good quality and you arent charged extra for the aroma therapy  They charge $55 for a 60 min  not a 50 min  massage  This is such a better value and experience all around than those chain places or paying hundreds of dollars in Scottsdale  Highly recommended and I have been to many spas in wide range of prices  I will be trying the facial in a few days  I am excited and hope its a good as the massage ,positive,4293075

We love the Studio B Buffet at the M   It is probably hands down the best buffet in Las Vegas Pros: The M sends out coupons for the line passes which helps because there is always a line   The food tastes great  the service has always been good   They have free wine and beer plus the dessert station is amazing   Gelato and espressos  lattes  and anything else you can think on Cons: There is always a long line so be prepared to wait and it is pretty expensive as far a buffets in Vegas go but worth the money ,positive,6068784

My wife and I absolutely love this place  It is a bit pricey  but if I could eat here every day I would  I agree with some others that think they should brand themselves as healthy or vegan/vegetatrian fare  but I dont care what they call themselves as long as the food is outstanding  Furthermore  I enjoy the quiet atmosphere in the restaurant (I hate all the chatter of Chilis  for instance)  It allows me to sit around with family or friends and actually enjoy our food with real conversations (instead of yelling to the other end of the table)  If youre into macrobiotic  vegan  vegetarian  healthy  or you just want to try something delicious  then this place is for you!,positive,3822065

Hmmm    where to start   the concept is great and the location is good but    and there are some BIG buts     the parking is horrendous     second complaint is that happy hour ends at four (4)    what the @!#$  The wine list is not that impressive and cost 22 00 with tip for two glasses  I think that it might be the perfect place on a saturday or sunday where glasses of wine are $5 00 till four (4)   on the other hand Aiellos is RIGHT next door and has 1/2 priced appetizers and drinks till 6 pm and the food and service was wonderful but thats another review      ,negative,1747882
This is our second trip  Margaritas were excellent and the salsa  guacamole  and queso was amazing  We ordered the Grill for two and the bacon wrapped shrimp was the best Ive had in 10 years  The Service was top notch with multiple servers checking in on us  even though it was the weekend and a busy Sunday  We were seated immediately (party of 2) and the Manager was making the rounds and stopped by and checked on us  ( she check on every table during our stay)  If youre looking for authentic Mexican and a huge drink menu/ full bar and a 5 page menu this is the place  Plenty of shops on all sides to visit before or after your meal  Definitely a Vegas Gem and deserves to be a stop on your stay ,positive,5317784

Just visited yesterday  and was impressed like always   Ive been coming here for years  its a great power lunch place  and the food is top notch  The atmosphere is really nice and calm in the afternoon  but noisy at night   It has a nice old school kind of feel to it   The Best Things: Pot roast Spinach artichoke dip Oysters (omg) Shrimp George French onion soup (which is dinner only now for some reason??)Special menus to match Smith Center shows   They did a Shrek themed menu in 2012 that was fantastic and fun  Not My Favorite: Seasonal side vegetables are never cooked enough and are toughFish and Chips cant really put my finger on it  but fish didnt seem cooked all the way through) No more valet parking  now you have to park in the Grands garage  although TG does validate ,positive,3356404

If you need car insurance in Las Vegas  call Eddie at Insurance 4 Less  Hes a 5 star guy working for a 5 star company   I went to State Farm and left Eddies company  To my dismay  I was duped by Statefarm and immediately called Eddie  He was gracious enough to go through numerous quotes and found me an affordable policy in less than a 10 minute phone call  By the end of the call  I was covered by a new policy  had my ID cards emailed to me and given instructions on how to tell Statefarm to shove it     Thanks Eddie! Youre the best! Im a lifer with you now ,positive,3142719
Have not been to Cheesecake Factory in several years  I got a $50 gift card from my family for Christmas  Soooo today i used it  THE BEST MEAL!  Started with a Martini no vermouth   To appetizer of Dynamite shrimp  Delicious  Crisp batter  light but spicycreamy dipping sauce   With the main course of medium rare Hibachi steak with mushroom wine sauce   This is the first time to the Crocker Park venue  I have been to other CF stores and did not have the same quality  Please people  Steak is not meant to be eaten well done  A diner next to me had a well done steak and she could hardly cut it  My steak was tender  delicious and easy to cut  At the very least do not order more than a medium  I gave this restaurant a 5 star for friendly staff and a great meal ,positive,1706486
Had two espresso drinks and a crepe with Gelato (chocolate crepe with peanut butter gelato  awesome)   Everything was off the charts good  Great taste and great environment to just relax for a bit ,positive,1675663
The patio was delightful!  An urban oasis tucked away in the back with room for several tables  featuring a fountain  greenery and many statues (angels and Buddhas alike)   Perfect for summer evenings  with enough umbrellas to protect from the rain As for the food  also delightful!  I had a green mango curry  which contained plentiful amounts of mango  vegetables and tofu   The spice level was a bit higher than I was expecting for a 2 but it wasnt too firey   A great Thai experience in a peaceful setting ,positive,4954814

Ruby Tuesday used to be in our rotation but since were never WOWd it has been at least 6 months since weve been in for dinner  We had a coupon for $15 off our meal  no restrictions so we happily came in for dinner  They recently (sometime in the past 6 months) got a new menu that was loaded with new options  I was sad to see my zucchini sliders disappear but half the time we were told they were out anyway  I kept things simple and just ordered the Veggie Trio which comes with three sides and the salad bar  I dont remember what my bf ordered  he wasnt overly impressed  it was just OK  We didnt leave hungry or unsatisfied  But  what really got us was the service  He was fantastic  I kept telling my bf that he could easily work in a fine dining restaurant  thats the type of service we received  Service was a 5 Food was a 3 5,positive,4355770

The foods not consistent  I ate here a few months ago and the food was great but yesterday it wasnt  The koobideh was dry  The restaurant is old and needs an update  They took out the nasty booths which was a good move but there is a lot of empty space  Ok for take out but eating there is a depressing  That whole strip mall needs to be town down ,negative,4893020

Holy chili cheese dogs Batman!!!! When out for a stroll on Fremont street stop by the D to have a chili dog  I have always wanted to try this place but never had a chance until now and once I went I have already been back   Its a small spot that can get pretty packed  Just for sampling reasons my husband and I shared a chili dog and chili cheese fries came out to $10  portions are those you would find at any fast food chain  I definitely could have eaten both by myself lol  Hands down one of the best hotdogs I have ever had!!! Not to mention the chili but Im just talking about the hotdog right now  If you like hotdogs I definitely recommend this place!!,positive,1751077
Overpriced for bubbletea (especially for those that been to Asia $5 vs $1)  But  the quality is significantly better than other places  I also like how I can customize the amount the ice and sugar in each drink  Recommended for the hardcore fans or for special occasions/discount events  Not recommended as a study spot as the tables are small and limited  In some ways  it is the Starbucks of bubbletea without the nice in store mood ,neutral,4163648
The facility was clean and the food was good  We went the day after Christmas and they were busy but not overly so  The service was slow and the waitress was rarely seen  I will say that I believe that has more to do with the waitress than the actual restaurant  but the service at a restaurant  reflects on the facility its self so that is why I place it in this review  We were seated right when we walked in but then it took 10 minutes to place our drink orders and then 35 minutes  for our food to come to the table  Like I said the food was great but the service was poor  There are plenty of other IHOPs  to select from in Cleveland so I was suggest going to another ,neutral,4828689

Excellent service  delicious food (especially brunch)  easy location and great environment  I love this place  its my new goto hangout  Cant wait to try other locations ,positive,1055453
I was excited to try this place because of the cute design and cute desserts just to find out that each person at your table needs to buy something on the menu    If you go as a couple  you cant order one thing and share it    Which is unfortunate  Overall the service was good and the food was good  A bit pricey but it was a nice experience   ,neutral,2717738
This is a scary place if your kid has a food allergy     What we liked    Fun atmosphere and decent food    What we didnt like was the service    Waitress was super dismissive and not caring when we expressed our son has serious food allergies when we were ordering    Then one of her teammates proceeded to plate an adult food in front of our son with one of his allergens in it    When we said that was not ok   she got super defensive and was not at all apologetic    Had no idea she almost sent our son to the hospital and didnt really seem to care or express any remorse ,negative,5237417
We had a group dinner here   Since there were 20 of us  we are always concerned that there will not be adequate service  someones meal will come out late  etc  as this normally happens when we assemble The service was fantastic!  There was never an empty water glass  drinks were replenished with phenomenal speed  and our food was brought to us without even a hint of a hiccup The quality of the food was also fantastic   Everything was cooked as ordered  and was fabulous   Yes  it is a little pricy   However  you get what you pay for   In my opinion  this restaurant is a great value in light of the return ,positive,6010145
Gord and I had supper tonight at the Granite Brewery with friends They brew their own beer onsite Gord ordered a Spinach Salad and plain wings   He said they were good   I ordered wings with honey garlic sauce and they were good   The others ordered salads  seafood stew  lamb burger  stout drunken burger  fish and chips  souvlaki  and poutine with steak     they enjoyed their meals too Our server was Julia   She was friendly but a bit forgetful   Gord never got his salad dressing nor did Wendy get her side of gravy     she got her decaf coffee when we asked again for it   As one of the servers was taking a plate back to the kitchen  he dropped it onto the floor next to us and leftover veggies and remnants from a seafood dish went flying onto our coats and possibly in Wendys purse ,neutral,1388620
Ok a biased review  Im only reviewing based on my search for the perfect almond croissant I think I found it! Been searching for a comparable almond croissant so that I dont have to trek all the way to Cherry Bomb Bobbette&belle  a mix of soft chewy moist and flakey crisp exterior with a yum filling paste inside  A bit more pricey $2 95 but made on site  The interior decor is really bright  light and airy  Kinda not so homey but a lot of pretty seating  Quite girly so not so sure if any guys or your man would like to join you for a coffee there without feeling demasculinized     But reaaaallly good croissant!Great presentation they didnt stuff my two croissants in one bag  and they even sealed the bag with their logo sticker !My friend bought a cupcake to give to his wife later and they put it in one of those cute  Chinese take out boxes with a sticker  It is pricey but I can see why! Good stuff b & b!,positive,4017901
Checked out this new place in the neighbourhood by a fluke   My friend and I intended on having lunch at another diner  but at the last minute we changed our minds and stumbled upon Eggsmart I had grilled chicken breast with salad and fries  oh and all the coffee I could drink   The chicken was moist and delicious   Well grilled I should say   My friend had poached eggs with home fries and some bacon   He was very satisfied with his choice  And on top of the deliciousness  the prices were great Being a new business  everything was very clean and the service was great   If they can keep this up Ill be back again and again ,positive,725574

From check in to check out  everything was wonderful for me  I had the pleasure of being waited on by Phil  at the front desk  and Shawn at ESPA  the sap/fitness center  and I have nothing but high praises for how professional and helpful they both were  I arrived at 11:30am  and normal check in time is 3pm  but Phil not only got me a room  he got me te best one I could for what I paid  Shawn  at ESPA  was nothing short of one of the friendliest  least gym intimidating people Ive met  He has a great physique  but also a great personality  I had a few questions and he was very well to answer all my questions with no issues ,positive,1297131

The salmon immediately sick got me really ill and I looked like a mad man after I ran to the bathroom  The meat selection is poor and service is the WORST! Avoid this place not worth your time and money  It wasnt even worth my groupon  I explained to the GM that the meat and seafood selection was really poor and rather than assuring me that he would work on fixing that issue he offered me a half off coupon  I didnt want anything  not even a free meal  I am very adamant about not eating here ever again  I can assure you that you would be better off spending another ten dollars and going to texas de brazil and getting your moneys worth  So overall: Tourist Trap  Disgusting Sick  Sick  LITERALLY SICK Food  Poor Service  Just Dont ,negative,4988854
I cant really add much more than whats been said here  They do take Interac and Visa now  At lunch time they open a 2nd checkout behind the normal one for card users  Ask them to toast your burrito for a while longer if you like it extra hot & melty  The Morning Glory muffins are the best  I am only disclosing this fact now because I no longer work in Liberty Village  and so cannot be there to snatch them up  The best roast is arguably the Bolivian Organic  They have an ATM  Its one of the only ATMs in the immediate area  Ask them to fill a large cup with ice (free)  Pour in your coffee  Voila  iced coffee  The dark haired girl behind the counter during the summer (and some other times) is a total sweetheart and Im glad to consider her one of the first friends I made when I moved to TO ,positive,1964263
Ive only been here twice  but the staff is great  Im not a big beer drinker  but I was able to find a few drinks I liked thanks to samples and one of the bartenders! I recommend the mead and the raspberry beer The only downside is that they dont regularly serve food  Theres usually pizza by the slice  though ,positive,3066986
A bit pricey but well worth it!The views at night are pretty cool as you can see the strip all lighted up    the sushi is delicious and the Kobe is a must!  They bring you the raw meat out in thin slices (about 6 slices I think?) and you cook it at your table so you can eat it fresh off the heated rock!  The service is top notch  very attentive and ready to answer any questions you have   It also helps that the servers are pretty attractive  pretty people only please   P   Yes  its one of those places in LV  like many    youre there to be seen and look cute The ambiance  food and service are all right on    really romantic and fun   you wont be disappointed   a nice stop after a day of shopping at the Palace   ),positive,73932
The Junk Guys are fantastic  I used them recently to dispose of a couch my dog decided to use as a chew toy during his puppy stage  The crew showed up promptly and were very friendly and professional  They took care to clean up the debris falling from my mauled couch as they removed it  which I thought was a nice touch  I appreciated that they were willing to pick up a relatively small load and were flexible with scheduling on my tight timeline  I would definitely use The Junk Guys again!,positive,4742177
Good place to go if youre hungry and dont want to cook breakfast   Not great due to the fact that most of their food is straight from the freezer to the frying pan and just soso   Small portions of bland food   Great people and great service   Just altogether blah food ,negative,1373414
I purchased their square deal pizza last Friday night for a party I was having and I have to say the pizza was LOUSY  It was just like eating bread  No sauce  No cheese  One pepperoni per slice  Even the pizza dough had no flavor  I would have been better off making my own pizza from the chef boy r d box  Called to complain and I even took back most of the pizza the next day because nobody was eating it and the owner had the nerve to argue with me  He kept the pizza and refused to refund my money  If you want good pizza  do NOT go here  They may save you a few dollars but in the end you will regret it ,negative,2529669
From first glance this place does not look like much  decor and overall atmosphere was not terribly inviting  Place could use a bit of a touch up  Service was good  nothing out of the ordinary  As for the important part  the food was ok  Beef tongue with mushrooms and onions had a great gravy like sauce  solid flavor  Yaki udon with pork and cabbage was not bad but not great  Black cod was a bit salty and yakitori was good but have had very similar in lots of other places  Mini honey toast was an ok finish Overall not a repeat destination for this style  3 5 stars,neutral,1297272
Room is nice in the Rush tower or so we thought  No electric plug ins next to the bed or any real location  WTF are any extra electrical plugs for us to to charge our freaking phones????

Absolutely some of the worst people to deal with ever  Locked me in a 2 year rate because they kept raising my bill with no warning and I threatened to leave  3 months later raised my bill again after agreeing to a 2 year locked in rate  They do this abuse to everyone and enough is enough  I am paying a fee to get out of a contract they didnt live up to  At this point it is well worth it  what a way to treat a customer of 8 years!!! Direct is coming on Wednesday to install their stuff  Worst customer service on top of that  These people are scam artist ,negative,163683

This place is pretty bad  I ordered a standard pepperoni pizza and there was so little cheese and sauce  I felt like I was just eating the rubbery crust  It was also too greasy  Too bad 1000 degrees had to close because their pizza was much better  I will not eat food from this place again  (Ill also mention that my husband ended up throwing away almost half his pizzahe never does that with pizza!),negative,5499138
This has to be one of the best Happy Hours in all of Scottsdale  It goes until 7:00 in the bar area only and the food and prices are hard to beat  Most of the dishes are $5 00 and they are huge  One of my favorites is the chicken in lettuce cups which comes with a large bowl of the chicken and white crispy noodle and 4 large pieces of lettuce  another favorite are the Vietnamese Chicken Summer Rolls They are not fried and are wrapped in a soy rice paper  You get 8 pieces and they are a decent size  Where else can you eat for $10 00 for 2 people without drinks  There are many  other choices on the menu including Ahi Ceviche  Calamari with Rock shrimp  Asian Nachos which are incredible  Duck Potstickers are just of the few of the 25 or so choices  You won;t be disappointed ,positive,5191873
This is where my band and I go to have band meetings and eat food   Its our spot We are most known for ordering the burgers  the onion rings  the fish and chips  the pulled pork sandwich and the mussels   My band mates seem to enjoy the beer menu as well This place is great Be warned though  they changed their delicious tomatoe sauce for the mussels and its not an improvement   I liked the previous sauce better   I asked them to make me the old sauce and they did  so glad I asked   The new sauce tastes like they poured a can of tomatoe sauce on top of the mussels where as the old sauce is nice and spicy  and has a lot more liquid   All of the other food items I mentioned that we order are fantastic All in all a great place   The only thing I would like to see is some new items on the menu ,positive,5361500

Nice while it lasted! The pastries were quite delightful (I had the Kiev cake and it was amazing and always my go to) however the girl working at the front may have been the most rude employee I have ever encountered  I understand that my rock n roll aesthetic may not appeal to your culture but she definitely did not mind swiping my Black Card  Definitely preferred the other girls that were working here before  I guess I will have to go elsewhere for my goodies ,negative,3895672
LOFT deserves 5 stars for their clothes  but one star for customer service  One of their salespeople (a woman with bright red hair and blue eyes) repeatedly tried to get me to sign up for their store credit card even after I explicitly told her no thank you  She even had the nerve to ask me if I was afraid of not being approved for the card!!! Talk about rude  I did find some nice clothes  but when I went to go purchase them  the same salesperson said  Wow  All these are full price  You would have saved so much with the card  I almost walked out  Im not sure what sort of incentives they have for their employees to push the store credit cards  but when a customer says no  they mean no  I love Lofts clothes  but Im hesitant to go back to this location for fear of being harassed by another salesperson  This salesperson nearly lost me as a customer  Beware ,negative,3380851

As someone who claims to be the best bbq in cleveland it doesnt even come close  The ribs were not fall off the bone  the sausage was subpar at best  and worst of all the brisket was just a dry piece of bark  There was a sliver of fat but the rest was like eating sandpaper (you can see in the picture) I highly recommend against going here  I spent $19 for a 2 meat combo with ribs/1 side and an extra piece of sausage  You can go to Dickeys 5 min away and get a 3 meat combo (ribs and brisket included) with 2 sides for $12:50 and their meat is actually presentable  If youre looking for a quick BBQ fix in the area  go to Dickeys  If youre willing to make the drive go to Mission BBQ in Parma for the best BBQ in cleveland and at a reasonable price ,negative,357781
My mom  sister  And I went here for breakfast on a Sunday  Luckily Vegas wasnt crazy busy and there wasnt much of a line on Sunday around 1  We had the option of waiting for a table  but we decided to do the countertops and sat down immediately  We each order one plate and none of us could finish our food  I suggest ordered one meal per couple cause its just overkill with food  Vanilla shake is delicious! But make sure you have an empty belly  22 oz for 6 95  thats a steal!,positive,3791383
Great location  staff friendly   We had a package which included underground parking and breakfast   Breakfast would have been good  but it was a buffet and the food was warm  at best   Service great   No control of the AC in the room and it was not adequate   Windows open  so that was a plus   Towels were stained  nearly threadbare and felt like sandpaper   Room was clean enough but curtains were torn and dirty   We found the beds comfy We had dinner here one night and the food and service were excellent!We stayed here in the past  but were a bit disappointed this time ,neutral,1514743

I love this Hospital  I really do  However I now see the discrepancy in the insurance access  I have good insurance  anytime I come here  I get treated very well  They have found my cancer  sepsis  pneumonia and my appendix  Top care each time  Today I went with my friend who has Medicare only  She was put in a separate area  One I had never been to  Was told she could only have an xray  Mind you  she cannot put any weight on her knee  She felt something pop like a rubber band  She needs an MRI   however she needs her PCP to give her a referral to get one  But she cannot walk!!! They wrapped her knee with an ace bandage  No clue on how this is supposed to help her walk! When she cant put weight on it  I am disappointed that because she does not have the insurance they want  You are unable to get the care you need ,neutral,2425838

Three years ago I would have given this place a 5 stars  I would have been raving to all my friends about going there a friday night  to load up on beers and enjoy the atmosphere before hitting another place  I would have held my birthday party there and took advantage of the patio  I probably would have been on first name basis with all the servers and bartenders Today  I honestly found the place too loud and the crowd too young for my liking  It is a college bar with a college feel  I met an old friend there for afterwork drinks a few weeks ago  I could barely hear myself think  I couldnt concentrate on anything my friend said  she was even ticked off thinking I wasnt paying attention  Bottome line  the drinks were a decent price and the food was pretty good  If I was 21 again  I would hang out there  But Im not  And I dont think I will be back there anytime soon ,negative,5667472

I loved this place each time we ate in  but today it was $53 for a Doordash delivery of a tiny side of $14 guacamole that obviously wasnt made fresh and didnt have the right ingredients (I was so excited for the pomegranate  which wasnt there  and it was packed with onions  which I requested without) and tacos that werent made correctly  and were filled with nothing but a big pile of cilantro and onions with very little dry meat  We would have eaten at the restaurant  but Im too sick to go out and all I wanted was tacos   but this was a huge disappointment ,negative,2468998
Hubby and I came here for lunch  They have great lunch specials  even on the weekend  We ordered the meatball appetizer  and it was super tasty  despite not getting the bread that was listed with it on the menu  I ordered the pizza and half salad lunch with a chopped salad and SOP pizza and hubby ordered the Signature sausage and the butternut squash soup  It was all delicious!,positive,1793192
Stumbled upon this gem in a Yelp search as my family was heading to the airport after a trip to Red Rock Canyon   The food was fantastic  from the rotisserie chicken with lemon chimichurri sauce or BBQ sauce  to the belgian waffle with mixed berry compote  to the banh mi sandwich   Yum!!!  Healthy food that tastes delicious    yoi gotta try this place!,positive,4626193
Loved this place! Flour tortilla chips to die for  Had shrimp tacos cooked to perfection   My husband had sour cream enchiladas  Every thing was perfect!,positive,3551574
What a great find!  Had lunch today and ordered the chicken on whole wheat pita   You get to choose all sort of goodies to add  including things like hummus and artichokes  The guy who helped was super friendly and helpful on some of the choices explaining what why you might like or not like something   excellent customer service in my book   So  healthy choices  great taste and great customer service   what more could you want?!  I will certainly be returning ,positive,6306913
Came during lunch  Not at all busy and great service  Food was great!Had a taste of what looked like ravioli with duck   holy! that is godtaste! yum  Ate the panini with salmon   also good but not godtaste!Gotta get that duck next time! duck duck duck   ,positive,635985

We stayed here list year (Nov 2011) my dad and I both really liked it    The WiFi is a bit spotty  do bring a signal amplifier if you have one   The restrooms are spectacular! I was dying to try out their salt water pool   but sadly  it was closed Its a higher price at about $35Ishtar a night and is north of downtown Las Vegas   It was really nice and is pet friendly with a tiny dog walk area   The mini golf is not worth mentioning as its smaller than the size of a super compact car  Totally recommend this park   You can easily find cheaper if you look but this is one of the nicer resorts we have been to ,positive,6105437
The service is terrible  they cant even tell us when the room will be available   They tell us 4pm on a Friday   We come back at 4pm  now they cant figure out when the room is ready   They tell us to leave and walk back at 5pm hoping the room is ready   With no guarantee    Service is flat out terrible   Dont stay here!,negative,5000392
I went here twice! the first time was great and customer service was ideal  the second time the customer service was slow and impersonal  i understood that they were busy  but it took 10 minutes to get our drinks back  15 minutes to get our pizza ordered  and 25 minutes to get our check AFTER we asked for take out boxes  the pizza is always absolutely amazing!,neutral,2800923
I found an awesome place for boba tea in Las Vegas!This place is very clean and lots of options great service!I got strawberry vanilla with honey boba  Original QQ egg waffle with vanilla ice cream Delicious!

Usually Im pretty easy to please   And its easy to make one or two mistakes  However  three of us went tonight and it was awful  We had difficulty all night getting any service   My order was done incorrectly (just wanted no onions on a burger) twice before it came a third time  obviously mangled and manhandled with all of the toppings scraped off (I wanted the rest of the toppings  just not the onions)   I gave up and just ate the fries    which were cold Our drinks were always empty  we spoke with the manager  who moved us to different tables (?) and the service did not improve  so after about an hour of this  we literally got frustrated and called it a night      and I left so thirsty that I had to stop at a cstore  and buy a bottle of water for the drive home ,negative,5786964
If your looking for authentic KoreanChinese dishes this is the place  The black noodles always hit the spot and you can tell its good as many local Koreans flock to this place for that dish  Only a few places in town that can execute that dish like they do They have many other items on the menu i have never tried  Looked and smelled like they had good Hawaiian/Korean barbecue plates as well  When I was there  I believe it was the owner who took care of the front of house flow while his wife was the one whipping up the amazing dishes  I believe the guy is hawaiian and his wife Korean  Amazing service and great food  Being a Korean restaurant they obviously have some ban chan and also some peanuts to snack on before the meal which was nice  I like that they do not try to be anything flashy or special  Highly recommend this place ,positive,3165132

The lobster friends are so delicious! Their specialty is definitely seafood  Fresh fish  huge lobster  and MSG free dishes I love the deep fried garlic bits on the lobster  The lobster is done perfectly  though big  never rubbery Service    pretty good for a chinese restaurantAtmosphere    typical small chinese family restaurant    its tight seatingReservations    you HAVE to make reservations on the weekend  or you might have to wait until 9 pm before you can get a table ,positive,4918901
First Chinese restaurant since moving to Tempe Az from Washington DC  Bad experience overall  Was not impressed with the staff  Seemed like we were forgotten about  My wife and I did not think the food tasted good at all  Possibly the worst Chinese we ever had  We got to go boxes for all of the food because we had trouble eating it  I tried offering the food to a homeless guy in the parking lot and he didnt want any of it either ,negative,1125602
Dont ask me why I got Fish and Chips    probably not the best thing to order at a place like this  but I did NOT expect it to taste like something out of the frozen food section at a local grocery store!I expected to be somewhat crispy and have some kind of a taste  but the fish and chips here was bland and SOGGY!  :( I rather eat a McDonalds Fillet O Fish   The Ahi Tuna Taco was not so bad  but they should probably go easy on the level of spice   I love spicy food  but for this dish  the spice overpowered everything else It was definitely not worth an hour wait     Probably wont be coming back here again ,negative,912476
A friend and I went in on Labor Day for dinner and to watch the game  We were seated by a hostess and then waited 20 minutes at the table with no server  We were not approached at all  not even for water  There was only one other table with customers  everyone else was sitting at the bar  We decided to go elsewhere and were not approached on the way out to see why we were leaving  We will not be returning ,negative,86246
We had to try this place after a coworker exclaimed that it was the best burrito hes ever had  The storefront is a little difficult to find as its off in a side street and looks inconspicuous  I ordered the pulled pork burrito ($11  change after tax)  and found it quite heavy    maybe 2lbs?! The burrito was decent  but I found the inside to be too watery  The best part is that they dont charge extra for guacamole  One of my coworkers ordered the quesadilla with fish and suggested avoiding the fish  His quesadilla didnt look much like what I expect a quesadilla to look like  It wasnt toasted and didnt have that much cheese ,neutral,6031300
My favorite mexican food in Las Vegas! Every time I come into town I make a stop here two or three times  depending on how long Im in town  It is so good and tastes like home  The tortas are my favorite  Try this place if you get the opportunity  You wont be disappointed,positive,3705200
I took my boyfriend here for his birthday and I reserved a table a couple weeks in advance  I asked to have a table by the window since it seemed like the best place to sit  We got there a bit early and were seated right away but it was at a table against the back row so we didnt really have a view of anything which was the main reason I picked to go there since we have only been in Pittsburgh a couple months  A table seated at the window was eating desert so it would have been nice if they wouldve asked if we would want to wait so we could have a better seat but they didnt  Even with that issue our waitress was awesome and very nice  The food was great and they give you a lot for what you pair for  They gave us a free desert with Happy Birthday on it for my boyfriend so that was nice  We will go back and hopefully get a window seat :),positive,2639572
Taco are the new fad of Cen Pho  I can name a burrito full of new tacos places with out thinking too hard  The same is true with Macho Mach taco as the rest  Two tacos are a bit small for a meal but at roughly $3 each a third would make it a bit pricey Out meal included a few chips however I do not think this was standard  if it were and unlimited it may make up for the lack smaller main course The Fish burrito was decent a bit heavy on the cheese  despite other great reviews of the burrito it was nothing special  The grilled veggie burrito is one truly unique item here as it even has humus in it   I did appreciate the salsa bar however more chips to enjoy it with were lacking Overall decent place but dont go out of your way to get here ,neutral,4677536
Not sure why I didnt try this place earlier  Really nice environment and more casual than I expected   Our service was very attentive but not pushy   Definitely the favorite thing we ordered was the flat iron steak ,positive,3945594
My party of 10 visited this very quaint and comfortable restaurant for my husbands birthday  We arrived for brunch a few at a time and were immediately seated  We were the first to arrive and ordered the queso fundido and chips and salsa  The tortillas that accompanied the fundido were hot  fresh and homemade  DELISH!!!! By the time everyone arrived I was stuffed  My entree was the red tamale with eggs and beans and oh so good! Everyone had something great to say about their food and the staff were so very kind  What a nice little restaurant with great food!,positive,3801815
I took in two of my vacuums after they lost suction  I was nervous that the repairs would be costly  but they technician saw that they were covered under warranty  The two gentlemen who helped me were able to fix both of my vacuums within an hour or so  and they were both friendly and professional  They were also honest that one of my machines would need a tune up sooner rather than later but that they were able to get me going for now  I would definitely come back and have them work on my machines again  Thank you!,positive,2638146
Cheese curds for appetizer were great   I had the bratwurst and bacon burger which was unique   tasty   and delicious  I got the french onion soup as a side and it was great surprise as it was the best part of the meal   It was even much better than the french onion soup that I had at the tornado room last night  which apparently was supposed to be some of the best in madison  Our server Morgan was nice and very helpful as well in helping us navigate our way around the big menu   5 out of 5 as far as gastropubs go!,positive,726800
Hands down   5 stars   Very clean and sterile environment     Jorge did a 3D butterfly on my shoulder yesterday and I am absolutely in love    I will never go to a different tattoo artist   He is absolutely unbelievable and very talented indeed     I sent him a picture of a real blue morpho butterfly and he was able to duplicate the colors and details even better than I ever imagined    A few months ago I went to Amanda to get a few piercings     She was professional  And very comforting as one of them made me a bit nervous   I also was suffering from migraines   She pierced my right daith as i was suffering migraines more on the left side  and i have not had a migraine since!  Overall  this establishment has some wonderful   talented and kindhearted employees    They have great music taste as well ;)  Go see Jorge and Amanda for any of your tattoo and Piercing needs!!,positive,1688520

I purchased a coffee table and two end tables  I asked the salesman if I could return them if I got them home and didnt like them  He said yes but there was a 20% restocking fee  After I got them home and assembled  I thought they looked cheap but wanted to give it a couple of days before deciding to return them  (They were in an area where they wouldnt be used ) I called a week after purchasing them to proceed with the return  but was told I only had 3 days to return them and now I was outside that window  She said she would try to get management approval and call me back but of course she never called back  They lost quite a good potential customer over this  We just moved here and have now purchased a new living room  dining room  and office (over $8K)  Now I am working on the guest room but they wont get any of that business either ,negative,2527203
Mr Mamas is such a great little place to go eat  The food is yummy but more importantly the service is wonderful  Our waitress was on top of everything  poured more coffee  fresh drinks when needed cleared plates when done etc  It was very evident that they have excellent management  Would definitely eat here again if Im in Vegas ,positive,3638117
Truly disappointed in this place  We love our Korean BBQ and have been searching for a decent one near us since moving to the valley  Perhaps we were spoiled with all our options in Southern California or while living in South Korea  but this place was just bad  from service to pricing  We are highly unlikely to ever come to this location again  Hopefully they figure it out soon so that they dont lose more potential customers ,negative,5732637
Ive eaten there several times   I wont rave about it  but its filling ,neutral,3043342
Why is there ALWAYS a freakin line out the door? Dont you think they could figure out that having 1 customer service agent during a peak time is a bad idea?! It doesnt help that everyone that works here seems to hate their job    *Le sigh*Pro tip: If you only need to ship an item  print shipping labels at home or use the machine out front  Save yourself some headache ,negative,6397264
I wasnt feeling well and asked for a ginger or lemon tea  but they didnt have anything other than a mild ginger peach tea  The barista instantly offered to make me a fresh ginger  honey and lemon tea from scratch  Which tasted amazing by the way!

A sweet little pho place nestled in a strip mall I would hesitate to visit alone at night unless I really wanted Vietnamese food   Ive been here a few times and have found the quality of food and service consistently good The restaurant is bright and inviting and smells of fish sauce   This time I ordered the vermicelli with grilled chicken and fried spring roll   It was delicious as usual  My friend had beef on rice   The precious (read: few) morsels of beef were wellseasoned  but a bit tough   Left the restaurant feeling satisfied and smelling of fish sauce   Would definitely come back ,positive,123005
I really liked this place! We tried two items chicken and steak shawarma  I would recommend the chicken  hands down  This place may have the most perfect yellow rice Ive ever tasted  Hummus is perfect also  Location is a little tucked away but keep your eyes peeled and youll find it  Its worth it! Great hours  Our bill was $5 00 extra for a sprinkle of feta cheese and we werent expecting it  Thats the only bummer ,positive,2554254
The dining area is pretty large with lots of TVs to keep up on what ever sport that is in season  Theres a Beer Garden patio off the dining room if you wish to sit outside  Lots of beer to choose from  Staff was friendly I was lucky enough to try The Hatch burger  I wouldnt of picked this burger if the menu was presented to me  But after Ive tried it  Id get it again  The burger itself isnt huge but it was plenty flavorful and juicy  Im looking forward to coming back to Umami Burger and trying more of their fare ,positive,4819886

I go here with my (Hong Kong) family to eat lunch It is typical  nothing special when it comes to Hong Kong style food  Nice filling portions  and decent pricing for a Hong Kong style place The service is terrible though  severely understaffed  No one will refill your tea  hard to get a servers attention for cutlery  and they have this I have no time for you attitude  If you want any custom orders (ie  unbuttered toast)  expect for it to be neglected or screwed up  Dont order anything healthy & western like salads or shrimp cocktails  youll be disappointed  Only go there if you are not a picky eater  super hungry  and will eat anything with time to spare for silly waiting times Again  severely understaffed  Their valentines decor is still up  I went in april ,negative,2081468

This is a cute ice cream little place    If you blink you will miss it   its small but still good  Theres always parking on the street  easy in and out     I only stop when there isnt a line because sometimes the wait is a little too long for me Browsing the menu  nothing seemed to jump out at me just the typical options  I went with a medium sundae  nuts  hot fudge and bananas   It was $5 50  I was a bit surprised it was over $5 00  It wasnt huge or anything but not small either     It was just a typical ice cream sundae   Its all the convenience you pay for  You can get a tub of ice cream or $5 00   On a hot day  ice cream sure hits the spot  I am grateful for this establishment existence because its the closest one to me but feel the prices could be a little bit more average I havent experienced what other reviewers have  with the lights and music   Its just a little cream shop if you are in the mood for a ice cream or a sundae ,neutral,5205107

Biscayne Bay Apts WAS a great place to live  Well kept  quiet with an attentive staff  New mngmnt abt a year (seems like ten yrs) its all changed  It has turned into a 3rd world complex  Its like they are intentionally trying to get rid of the good tenants  The new management team apparently could care less what happens here especially the onsite manager who thinks shes doing you a favor answering tenant concerns (when shes actually here) Attempted apartment breakins  Shady characters looking to break into cars  This has basically become an ongoing crime scene  If you value your wife  kids or car stay away  Far far away  Great places to live in Chandler     this is no longer one of them  Stay away or bring a gun!!,negative,570115

I go here all the time with my family  Its our go to sushi place when were not feeling like AYCE Sometimes the service is a little bit slow  just because its hectic  but they usually make up for it by giving us dishes on the house My usual is the Niku Donburi (I13); stir fried veggies with egg and bulgogi with some sort of special sauce on top of rice  If I dont feel like rice  I opt for udon  usually Kaki  but sometimes tempura if Im in the mood  The actual sushi is kind of hit & miss depending on what you order  The California rolls are kind of weak but you can substitute parts of your sushi order  so its not a big deal  My favourite part is that they give us green tea ice cream at the end  Last time they gave us a deep fried banana too! If you read my other reviews  youll see that I really love banana ,positive,2080030
Pad Thai and pad see ew used to be good   Used to go here because it is cheap   Today I asked for pad Thai without bean sprouts and they added a huge wad of green onion   Tasted so disgusting but I didnt want to be rude or make them have to make another one   Went from favorite place to never coming back again ,negative,4171908

Laid  back  atmosphere where  people  are allowed to show  their music  skills  by playing  the instruments on the stage!  We were  here  for  over  an hour  and 2 dudes  went  on the stage  and were  somewhat  decent   We had few drinks  and were ready to chew on something  but  the barmaid  told  us that the  kitchen closes  at 8 and past that  they  only  have typical  sport menu    So  weve ordered  the chicken  wings  that  gave  us  more reason  to get more drinks!

I went there today  The place was actually easy to find  though a bit far from where I stay but totally worth it  We had a group of three  and the four dishes we ordered were very good  The steamed red pepper fish was very fresh and had a rich taste  The Chairman Mao Pork was the BEST I ever had  I forgot to take pictures before they were gone  The restaurant also has mild and nonspicy choices for our people who has a low threshold for spicy food:P,positive,4851636
well it helps that they are located in the las vegas new rental car center which is bigger than some airports that I have flown into   The wait in line is too long  they make you sign so many forms that I thought I was buying the car   The price is misleading as well   The quote you get from the website is a estimate and they tack on $10 in some sort of fees   The cars are fine but I thought it could have been cleaner   The guy that checks your car takes his time as well   But overall not bad if you get a car for $13 a day  which was the cheapest in the rental car center   I am spoiled tho since I use Hertz gold for my business travels ,neutral,6658216

All I can say is WOW! I paid a few dollars extra for the balloons to last longer and I have a balloon that has been floating on my ceiling since February 21st!  Its lasted over two months and the product is just so good I cant even get it down,positive,223687

I normally love love love Panera  Today they ruined It for me  First off  they failed to prepare our offices phone in order  When our runner got there    no food  Couldnt even find that we had placed  and paid for! Our order   then they left out two items when they did fill the order  All that was really just an inconvenience  It was the getting violently ill after eating my lunch that ruined it for me  Dunno what they did to my broccoli cheddar soup but I thought I was going to die!  Obviously I didnt and now Im probably never going to be able to enjoy Panera again    bummer!,negative,2495315
I love this place! I will be back everytime I come to Vegas  My friend and I had so much fun  The guys are super hot! Not to sure about Ted  but whatever floats your boat  they have it   Hahaha  The $30 cover charge is a great deal for a limo ride to and from your hotel and 2 drinks  I wouldve spent more than that on just a cab  I liked that it wasnt too crowded and we were able to find a table  and this was a Saturday night   Waiting in line outside kind of sucked  but it went quick  My only regret is that I was so nervous  this being my first time at a male strip club  that I drank too much too quick and we had to leave earlier than my friend wouldve liked  I cant wait to go back  Ive told all my friends about it and well have a much bigger group next time ,positive,2440690
A sleek and modern looking building   I attended a Mobile Monday event in the auditorium   Seats were plenty and comfortable for a 1 1/2 hr long discussion   Theres a minifood court with a Tim Hortons and few other food places in the basement A nice event venue   Kinda made me wish I was still in school ,positive,119949
When my friends and I were searching for the place  we definitely missed it like two or three times  Upon finding it  I must say  this is definitely one of Torontos hidden gems When you walk in  the atmosphere in the room is absolutely breathtaking  The room is nicely decorated  dimly lit  with small groups sharing tables here and there  Definitely the kind of place for a more intimate night with that special person or a small group of friends you want to catch up with on a real level Service was great  Took a little while to get the drinks until I realized why its called Barchef  They really do specialize in unique drinks not served anywhere else in Toronto  Drinking there really made you appreciate all the little details these bartenders put into making a drink  Definitely NOT your typical bar that dumps drinks in a glass and says Hey tip me  They really work for it Only downside is that its pricey  If I had the money though  I would definitely come here more often ,positive,6358252
wife absolutely loves this place   I dont get it   its good but certainly nothing special   however tommy lasorda yelling for everyone to say they love the dodgers was pretty epic!!! caesars salad is good but highly recommend the apple gorgonzola salad! garlic bread is strong enough to kill vampires   baked ziti was pretty bland  the stuffed chicken thing was pretty decent   meh  next ,neutral,6662427
Looking forward to staying here for another business trip in a few months  Clean  comfortable room  everything worked  staff seemed to care about the guests  Never had anything bad at the many restaurants/bars  The location is convenient with the tram and short walk to shops and stores Casino not nearly as crowded and noisy as others in town  I dont care if it lacks the luxury of some other hotels  for the price its a great deal ,positive,3460736
I stayed at this hotel last weekend  I loved my room!! So nice  The bed was super comfy  My view was awesome  The buffet is the best ever   We go every morning when we are in town and the people who work there are the best  They are the real reason we go there  I will for sure stay here my next time here,positive,2603978
Went last night for girls night out  Everything was FANTASTIC!

The spicy clam and pork tonkatsu is great! This place is pricey for a ramen place  but I will definitely come back if they continue to make highquality noodles ,positive,5013826
LOVE LOVE LOVE this nail salon  Monica and her team are so friendly and so easy going  They always make me feel welcome  and always appreciate customers coming back  They do my nails  and wax and I must say I have never been more pleased  They have such great personality and is very good with what they do  They always ask if they did an ok job before finishing the job to make sure I am satisfied with what I am paying for ,positive,3382180
Hey all   Well  here goes nothing  Lol   Im reading some of the reviews and Im not sure why they would give 1 star here??  I suppose they had a single bad experience but for me I wouldnt do that unless its been a few times   I have only been here once but it was really good   My friend and i both ordered pizzas and salads    The salads were out in 2 minutes and the pizzas were out within a minute or two of finishing the salads   The pizza isnt like Dominoes or an Americanized type pizza but is rather on a rectangular shaped dough that is more similar to a flatbread   It was really good and didnt give me the heart burn  bloated gut feeling you get with a lot of other pizza places   I really enjoyed it and the ingredients were fresh and tasty   I finished the meal with an espresso that comes with a small chocolate wafer!  I will definitely be back   Enjoy!,positive,1734017
I have been coming here since we moved in this area  This is my first try to eat a portuguese food  The chicken is a bomb and served with their rice and potatoes  It just goes together  The chicken is perfectly cooked its not dey and not burned and add to that a sauce and everything is just amazing  Will keep coming to this restaurant ,positive,2194595
Honestly Ive been to many sushi places but this is by far one of the worse  Horrible service  I had to ask for my drink 4 times within 3045mins before it got to me  The japchae (dont know if thats spelled right ) was watery  The food made not only me but my familys stomach hurting once finished  My father in law threw it up  Overall not happy  Id recommend Yama across the street ,negative,1757107
Memphis Championship Barbecue has perfected the fried okra  Their sauce is nicely balanced and complements the meat well  The baby back ribs and pork shoulder were great with extra sauce  but alone were slightly dry  Loved the sweet apple tea  Service was great as well Overall  a very enjoyable experience  Ill surely return for more Championship Barbecue!,positive,3608833
Great food  coffee & a pretty spot to enjoy it in  Not a huge fan of breakfast potatoes but theirs are excellent  The rosemary toast is an out of the ordinary treat  Solid pancakes & egg dishes too!  Coffee is self serve & 5 star yummy ,positive,1482101
No  Noooo thank you My friend ranted and raved about this place  it sounded good  close to work  and I was in the mood for some BBQ I purchased a pulled chicken BBQ sandwich  side of mac and cheese  and     waffle fries I think (obviously  unforgettable)  Within the first bite of my chicken sammich  I found a chicken joint thing within the chicken     There was only a bun  pulled chicken  and bone fragments (no additional toppings)   They did have a lot of different types of sauces and they were great (hence the two stars instead of one)!  The mac and cheese was super bland and mushy The actual restaurant is near deer valley airport  in an office plaza  and has an industrial feel to the inside If you really like BBQ  check it out  but check the food before you take your first bite!,negative,3909510
Once again  the service at this place can not be beat   Refills on water/ice tea/drinks were constant   The waiter and helpers were outstanding and the manager appeared to take a real concern with our dining experience   Food was great  price is not deadly ,positive,4049834
Two nights and two trips to the Earl Tried the Original  Club  Meatball (Cannonball)  Tuna Melt  and the Full Montagu and liked them all  Its a trend I dont expect to change  They were all great in their own way  so its more a matter of preference  Whether at the beginning of the night  at the end of the night  or during the night  its worth the wait (the line is usually pretty long) Open 24 hours  busy 24 hours  damn good 24 hours P S  Also tried some cookies  chips  and parfaits  but no doubt the sandwich is star   hence the name of the restaurant  Worlds greatest hot sandwich  I believe it so far   Go Dodgers ,positive,5741716
Everything was delicious!!! From the opening biscuits and blueberry spread to the praline bacon and the eggs betty! Everything we had was so so yummy! Big plates! We ordered too much as we often eat with our eyes  The pancakes in rum sauce are delicious but a hefty plate and slightly overwhelming if not sharing  Would definitely recommend and would return here ,positive,1018393
Jaleo was terrific  Great atmosphere in the heart of The Cosmopolitans foodie scene   The center of the restaurant is a $2 million grill/open flame where they grill meats & veggies and make a mean paella!We started with a bottle of cava (of course) and went on to enjoy several tapas for the table  We especially loved the verduras asadas  patatas bravas  paella (pork)  and the gambas   The only dish we did not love was the jamon iberico fermin which was a bit fatty and lacking in flavor  (However  the aged ham in the verduras was amazing)Really fun dining experience!,positive,3296778
We had been to Campania about 4 times over the past several months and really enjoyed it  However last night they dropped the ball  The bathroom was filthy  just plain disgusting  which does not help your appetite and makes you wonder how clean everything else is  The shrimp was tasteless and the service slow  I really hope that it was just an off night and they get back to form ,neutral,6018286
It was worth the wait to eat here  Had brunch last Saturday before flying home  I have to say  the portions are huge! Had the chicken and waffles plate  plus a huge omelet  The chicken was so juicy  and was well seasoned  Waffles were soft and sweet ( with the syrup) The frozen chocolate drink was great too  The sweet potato fries were crispy and delicious Will definitely go back next time Im in  Vegas  I may try the takeout window next time if I just get the frozen chocolate drink   Seemed like the minimum wait time was always 35 minutes,positive,3240266
OMG!  I just wrote how the food wasnt very good at Nicks  and one of the people in my party heated up leftovers (they hate to throw food out even if its not good!)  and there was a paper clip in the pasta!Dont eat here!!!!!  I want to call the health department!,negative,3978202
My mom and I stopped here for lunch here today   The space was clean and the sandwiches were consistent with the kind of solid deli fare that Ive come to expect from Jimmy Johns since my undergrad days   However  the assaultingly loud music that was playing in the store made me think twice about ever returning   While the level might not have seemed as bad for the employees at the counter  the dining space is cavernous  and my mom and I were straining just to have a simple conversation  even though we were the only diners at the time   I finally asked a staff member to lower the volume  and only a negligible adjustment was made   I shouldnt have to make that kind of request twice   My mom wears hearing aids and already struggles to hear in public settings  even where the sound is more moderate   This situation needlessly soured our meal   Not OK  Jimmy Johns ,negative,3789778
I hate to only put 1 star but it is deserved  PROS: Roasted Red Pepper Hummus made fresh   Good portion sizes and fresh ingredients CONS: The server was rude  impatient and felt like we were on her schedule   She snapped at us when we inquired about our appetizers  Once we had our entrees  she watched over us like a hawk   Felt rushed and uncomfortable   With it being such a small establishment  her hovering made us feel like we were in a mousehole We could not find any lamb in the Lamb Stew  The couscous in the grilled chicken skewer couscous was soggy and unflavored  Extremely disappointed in the dish since it is basically the establishments name  The sandwich was clumsily made and fell apart with the first bite   Not much flavor  especially for Moroccan food Never returning ,negative,2175953
The cashier that is always on the 10 items or less express lane is very rude he is not happy to be working there ( older white man)   He seems very annoyed by the guests Target should replace him with someone who will at least pretend to be nice   The Starbucks girls are very friendly,negative,4803094
I was stressing out over a battery issue in my car   It was just over a year old and purchased from this location    I went inside too ask Ellena about charging it and she told me too bring it in  coming straight from work I had no tools so she gave me a set too use   After getting the battery out and on the charger it only took 5 minutes before she was telling me the battery was   Even before I had time too worry about the price I another battery she had one up on the counter and rang it up under my warrenty where Ivan ( the manager )  walked by and happily put his code in the system bringing my total up  $0 00   My favorite price   I was in and out in about 15 minutes with a new battery and nothing taken out of my bank account   Now only if they would of taken care of my dry cleaning  got my shirt a little dirty getting the battery out   Ohhhhh well  Next time  Thank you guys for making it a stress free visit,positive,2768482

This place has the best mojarra frita in Arizona and the best margaritas  We drink virgen margaritas and we can taste the fruit in the drinks  Their salsa has a good kick to it  Im picky with my salsa but this one passes the test  You should come try it if you like fish you will not be disappointed  Prices are also very reasonable  Check it out for yourself ,positive,5414485
So happy to find a classy sushi restaurant in Las Vegas right here on Spring Mountain  The jammed parking lot speaks volumes about the hood and the nigiri did not disappoint  Reminded me a lot of those super cool New York sushi restaurants  Highly recommended ,positive,4504319
This place is amazing  The bartenders make great craft cocktails  Craft Beers on tap like Big Wave  Elysian Space Dust IPA  Franziskaner Hefeweizen etc and THE FOOD? Wow! Best burger Ive ever had  MUST TRY the green chile burger  all house made ingredients on a poblano bun  FANTASTIC  This is the absolute best bar in the area They have karaoke on Friday and Saturdays  pool table  darts  jukebox  shuffleboard  beer pong  etc Everything that makes a great local spot!,positive,5446183

We just left this place and it was great  Vivian was accommodating over the phone for a last minute yelper discount  After a nice morning of horseback riding  for my Wifee bday  the unexpected full body massage was a nice touch  It was very relaxing  semi private with comfy chairs for just us two  Water or hot tea along with snacks was a nice touch  We got the 60 min session expecting just a foot rub  but turns out it was head to toe and back  along with the feetie rubs   Thanks! Will repeat!,positive,6057386
Its a sports bar  Havent come across any food that I didnt like but I cant for the life of me remember what I had  Service was great The interesting thing about this place is that they tell you We dont have Happy Hour specials  we just have specials all day  Ok    I get it  but isnt easier to say that they dont have a HH because if the prices are the same 24/7  then does that really qualify it as a special? Just saying Regardless of their No HH  the prices on alcohol are ok  Nothing really to get me to drive all the way there for a few drinks that I cant get in my area  The place is a nice hangout spot  most especially if youre into sports  From the decor to the tv content  youll love it if you love sports Id like to check this place out during a game  from the other reviews  it sounds as though die hard fans come out to watch games here ,positive,3252634
I wanted something unique for an event  However  I was hesitant to try this after reading some reviews  When I called they told me it was under new management  The arrangement that arrived looked exactly like the picture  The fruit was sweet and fresh  I will use this Edible Arrangements location again ,positive,2696005

I walked in with really messed up nails because I had gone to another salon in town that didnt do the job correctly  Steven listened intently to what I wanted and took his time to make my nails look great  The salon was clean and had a welcoming atmosphere  I have been looking for a salon to call home over the last few months and its safe to say  I have finally found it! I will definitely be going back ,positive,2689396

Take Away:  Decent pizza and wings if you are in a pinch for pickmeup   Ambience good to catch a game/beer/dine inWe ordered some take out pizza and wings from Barros and went in to pick it up   Walking into the restaurant I was shocked how nice the interior looked/the number of TVs they had   It seemed like a solid play to catch a game   And the 45 beers they have on tap doesnt hurt either   The actually pizza we got was a veggie and it not too badplenty of vegetables but I personally thought it was overcheesed (assuming thats a verb)   We got hot wings as well and they seemed better than your Little Ceasers variety but probably not as great as your true wing titans aka they probably will get the job done for wingnut ,neutral,4678998
Horrible serviceI brought 5 guests to this establishment on January 2  2015  My friend wanted to order a drink that was not listed on the menu  The waitress stated that the drink could not be made nor did she understand how to ring it up  So my friend ordered another drink on the menu  One of my other friends asked the bartender if he knew how to make this drink and he said yes  So then we told the waitress we wanted the other two drinks  She said its too late and we asked to speak with the manager  He rudely states the drink was made and did not offer to make the other drinks  Both the waitress and the manager had a careless attitude as the waitress slammed our drinks on the table   Please make sure bar Louie hires competent staff member that know how to make customers have a pleasant experience  Would I return? Maybe if a new manager is on duty and a waitress that tries to accommodate the customer  This is a nice establishment with lots of potential ,negative,1773484
I stopped in to Bennys for the first time for lunch and got a slice of the Buffalo Chicken pizza  The slice was MASSIVE  Its a little thicker than your typical NY slice  but its one of the better options for pizza on East Carson  I live a block away from Bennys  so I will definitely be back!,positive,2615148
It all started with a heartwarming greeting from Rebecca  she was wonderful  how she honored my dads wishes when he ordered and made it a joy to order  As she was helping my dad her smile radiated to everyone else in line  and comforted and served them like melted butter!! Next  the food came  Were from New England and I was raised on lobster  and used to what lobster rolls should be  and believe me! This one is just like it! Loaded with lobster and sides toasted to perfection JUST LIKE IT SHOULD BE  believe it when you order from Rebecca youll be taken care of  Great experience  perfection!,positive,3201621
I have been going to Savers for about 16 years now(the one on spring mountain that is now on sahara )    if youre wondering why your store is so empty lately  its because people have caught on to your shenanigans   For the first time  I noticed some of your womens blouses are priced at $12 99  are you kidding?  Ive also been burned by you  by the people who lie about the prices in the display case   you cant get away with this for very long  as you can see   this is supposed to be a THRIFT store!  I used to go three times a week  now its once every two weeks  also  when I do go every two weeks  many of the items are still there which means no rapid turnover ,negative,2205573
We have found our new goto guy for appliance repair! Roms 5 star reviews are very well deserved   When our icemaker broke down  we decided against using the repair service company our home warranty was going to send out because of the horrible reviews the company had  Based on a colleagues recommendation  we called Rom and he was able to come over  diagnose the problem  took out the dead icemaker  and replaced it with a new one in short order  Friendly  fast  efficient service   He will be the one we will call for any future appliance repair we need ,positive,6045201
Um  wow  I saw the reviews and thought it was just Summerlin judgy   they are not wrong  This is quite possibly the whitest Mexican food on the planet  No flavor  inconsistent with what Mexican food is everywhere else  Neither salsa was edible  queso with chorizo was super gross  Chile relleno had super grisly beef in it  salmon tacos were super limp and soggy with gross zucchini pickles on top  WTF?!,negative,5755071
As you can probably perceive from the picture I took  the restaurant has a beautiful atmosphere thats as fresh and vibrant as the food they serve! Plenty of outdoor seating and even some indoor seating for restaurant goers  It was a after noon but it was still crazy busy  so be prepared that there are many other people that know about and want to enjoy this yummy food! Its well worth the crowd in my opinion  I had the fish fry special and sure enough this was flaky hand breaded and well seasoned fish  I dont like ordering fish in AZ  however  the food here looked so good and fresh and so many people ordered it  I gave it a try  What I really enjoyed were the corn fritters that were full of flavor and so crunchy on the outside! Inside were while corn kernels that added a nice texture and pop of sweetness to the hush puppy  The fries and slaw didnt disappoint! They do have desserts as well but I was too full to try any    Next time Joes! :) Ill be back!,positive,361873
I love eating at the L A  Canters near my home  I usually end up dropping $20 on cookies as I am walking out as well  so this bakery free environment was much better for my wallet Their sandwiches are piled high  but still biteable  and the service is always kinda friendly  kinda not  Except at this location  where the servers were doing this weird thing with their mouths     smiling i think it is called ?     They have good burgers  damn good grilled cheese  but it is their pastrami and other deli sammies that rock  At this location I had my usual  Pastrami Combo #1  which I bath in Thousand Island with extra pickles  It hit the spot in ways It never had before    perhaps because it was 2:30am  and I was intoxicated thanks to lemon drop martinis ,positive,2395185

Went there on date night with the wifey place is nicely set up & clean  We were seated immediately and the waitress came right away  We ordered the tuna tartar which tasted really good but the avocados were hard  Also had the fries which we both didnt taste the truffle Entrees I had the steak Diane menu says its fillet but its not! At least what I got wasnt fillet  The sauce/gravy was a salty as per the other reviews  I dont think I would order that if I were to go here again  Also had the salmon which was really good the rice it came with was really good  I asked for the lemon sauce on the side which was a smart idea  We then got the trio dessert the flourless cake was hard and looked & tasted like a brownie  The creme burle was pretty good not the best Ive had but not the worst  Ice cream was good  The service was good and prompt except for our app dishes werent removed before the main courses came out ,neutral,6268278
Took my Land Rover to Supreme Auto Bath this morning and it was an excellent experience overall   The moment that I parked the vehicle at the service bay  the attendant greeted me courteously and explained the various detailing packages and add ons available  I had interior and exterior detailing and carpet shampoo completed  all done in less than one hour   Their prices are very competitive  In the past I paid over $120 for these services elsewhere   Excellent detailed and thorough job  every attendant and the Manager were all courteous and polite   Lots of bays available to keep the service moving quickly and the WiFi and TV is a great feature for customers waiting    Thank you Supreme and keep up the good work!,positive,5698829

I live in Regent Square so Ive had the chance to try this place a couple of times  I will admit  I was not impressed the first time (late 2015) because the portions were so small for the price    and not like Im a mad American because I didnt have left overs but  We got multiple dishes and really felt ripped off  It was literally lunch portions at dinner prices  However  I returned last month and theyve really changed the game  The food is great and the menu isnt too large  Definitely worth a visit  And of course  get an appetizer ,positive,2366188

I have to say Im quite impressed with the new and improved Elite Nail Spa  Now under new management since the last time I visited them  elite nail spa has been renewed with a warm  friendly staff and flawless service   You are immediately greeted when you enter the business and offered a beverage of your choice  I do not get my nails done very often   however   in celebration of my birthday   I decided to go for it   With knowledge of my birthday prior to my appointment  the owner of the salon greeted me with a birthday balloon  A very thoughtful and unexpected surprise that put a huge smile on my face  My nail tech paid close attention to detail and she was very gentle   Usually I encounter my fair share of cuticle nicks from the nail tools but not at Elite Nail Spa! I was very pleased with the outcome of my nails and the service provided   I will be back!!,positive,2285073
I have received several massages over the years  so I have some base of experience in this area   My girlfriend and I went to Sol Escape for hour long massages late last year   I needed work done on my upper back and shoulders  as my job has me leaning and lifting regularly   Hannah was my therapist  and she was fantastic   Despite her relatively diminutive stature she had plenty of pressure and strength  and she really listened to my needs and what I was trying to accomplish   The building was well lit  which is to sat somewhat dimly  and very relaxing   Im not a big energy of a place kind of guy  but there really was a calming feeling both in the reception area and the massage room   I felt relaxed and soothed after my massage  and my girlfriend did as well   Highly recommend!,positive,2274679
As a small business owner whenever  possible I try to use small businesses for my needs   There are a few criteria that I look for during my search for service: Communication  ease of scheduling  affordability   Andrew hit all of these while I was searching for a company to clean my exterior windows so I scheduled my appointment  On the day of my appointment there was a slight delay on arrival due to a flat tire but once again the communication from Andrew was prompt and professional  the crew arrived shortly after our scheduled appointment time and were so apologetic   I showed them the windows and they got right to work   I could not have been happier with the end results!  Our windows have never looked better   Shiny  streak free and crystal clear! Exactly what we were looking for! I highly recommended Summerlin Window Cleaning  and will definitely be using them again!,positive,346121

Update to the last review   The manager of the store was supposed to issue a credit for the bulb that they put it to fix the problem   He charged me again instead of crediting   I called the next morning and he argued with me  telling me that there was no way he could have done that   After searching thru yesterdays paperwork  low and behold  he admitted that he double charged me   And proceeded to tell me that I was a rude lady   Ummmmm  really? for checking on a double charge????  Told him I was at the bank getting the charges (all of them) reversed) he hung up on me   I then received a call from a number I didnt recognize   IT WAS THE OWNER OF THE SHOP CALLING TO HARASS ME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   Told me he was going to call his lawyer and take me to court LOLOLOL   For what?  I told him to bring it on!,negative,5772801
Teriyaki Madness I am so so so sorry for betraying you and branching out  I had the Teriyaki Chicken combo here and it had maybe a 1/4 the amount of chicken as teriyaki madness  They chicken was really rubbery and slimey which obviously means no good  The mixed veggie were added as filler and the majority of the meal was white rice  I live right by here but I will just drive the extra mile to get the good stuff for a better price ,negative,4690599

Quick  excellent and affordable service  I would definitely use them again and I highly recommend that anyone with a garage door issue contact Jeff for exceptional service I can see why Jeffs company is rated number one on Yelp  His actions reflect a high level of customer focus ,positive,1914227
Federal Galley is such a cool space  with even better food! We had the tacos & salad and chips & guac from El Lugar  They were outstanding! The guacamole had goat cheese in it  which was delicious  The bar also has a great happy hour with half off drinks! Definitely worth checking out ,positive,1109518
Wow!  Go for the food  wine & atmosphere!  American Filet was AMAZING   Sides have large portions  so share!   Great Experience   Service was just ok ,positive,6464130
Overall I think the food  design  and service of the restaurant is pretty good  However I have one major issue that ensures I will not order from the glass display during nonpeak hours Maybe I am the only one who noticed this  but they take the food directly from the glass display and heat it again  Not so bad if its freshly made during lunch hour  but imagine coming here during nonpeak times  The salad/sandwich could have been sitting there for hours then served to you    unappetizing ,negative,4155539
If you only see one Cirque show in your life  this is the one to see (we have attended over 8 Cirque shows over the past 12 years)!  As others have noted  this is not your typical Cirque show (all other shows have a band playing music live to the acts  this one is playing actual Beatles recordings)   You do not have to be a fan of Beatles music to enjoy the show   The sound system in the theater is the best I have ever heard (I have owned highend home sound systems as well as performed as a musician)  there are even speakers in each seat for ambience  Put this show on your bucket list ,positive,3143324

Not especially good on Sunday late afternoon Understaffed which means long waits in lanes  including express  No staff visibly present on the floor Inexperienced employees means sale items are out of stock Im not sure why the cashiers are running around doing price checks and bagging groceries AND lifting water into carts Long line now at customer service because rain checks are needed to replace out of stock items ,negative,3927866
Both service and food were well below average   We were genuinely hoping we would love this since it is a local restaurant   Unfortunately  we will not be returning after this experience ,negative,582389
Craving some sugar  I tried a salted caramel cupcake from For The Love of Cake the other day and it hit the spot  The cake part was very moist  the salted caramel had the right balance of salty and sweet and the frosting was more of a French buttercream style  which I prefer over the overly sweet American style  and the ratio of cake to icing was just perfect If they were located closer to me Id definitely stop in again to try out some of the other flavours ,positive,784694
My alltime favorite BBQ joint  I could eat their pulled pork sandwich every day! I also love the Mac and Cheese  We always take advantage of the $10 free birthday meal  especially since my husband goes crazy for the lemon cake ,positive,3653064
Best location  nice bar (the cavern)  free wifi for custumors and fair pricing  Nice Staff  I love the staff  the travelers and the atmosphere here  Even though the ATM isnt working with every card  it works well with my MC  The food in the cavern is nice  but its only included in the 4 and 6bed rooms  Otherwise youll have to pay round about $7  but thats fair for Toronto  There is always entertainment in the cavern starting at 9pm  The beds are good and the rooms are ok  But you only sleep in them  so that dont matters for me  Most rooms and showers are unisex with shower cabins  For girls  there are girls rooms as well  The laundry is working fine  but you need to pay the cleaner yourself  The community kitchen (like the cavern also in the basement) is nice and offers everything youll need except your food  And it lacks an oven   Thats all by now ,positive,535829

Awesome place to eat on a Sunday morning  Lots of dim sum options: bbq pork buns  shrimp and pork shumai  rich congee  crab claws  pork ribs and black bean  YUM!!! Service can be a little slow at times  but this place did fill up by 11:00  And the carts of goodies are trucking along  Not as great as some of the places in San Fran Ive been to  but for Vegas it was great  $27 with tip how can you beat it? I will be back for sure!,positive,406447
I ate here for the first time this week during lunch and was pleasantly surprised Inside  the restaurant was bigger than most Thai restaurants   We were greeted upon entering and seated quickly   I had the Pad Thai lunch special for $7 95   You get to choose between the soup of the day (chicken noodle the day I went) and a salad with peanut sauce   I chose the salad and it was great (then again  I love anything with peanut sauce)   The Pad Thai was a super large portion   I ended up splitting it in half right then and there to take the other half home for dinner   It was also accompanied by an egg roll  Again  service was great  a super quick lunch  made it back to work within an hour  even though this place was about 5 miles away  Overall  I enjoyed my meal and thought I had gotten more than enough food for the price   I will most likely be coming here again  but next time Ill try something off the regular menu ,positive,1893609
Was in there last week and was very impress with their service  My 2001 Ford F250 is from back in Chicago and to say the least it has rust over the truck  These guys NEVER came back and said we cant or we need more money for this or that NOTHING!! You have to love going to a professional place to get work done that they did a great job!! Thanks guys!!,positive,5919629
This is where you should go if you dont like beef! I dont know whats in their burgers but it doesnt taste like beef at all  And for a fast food joint the service is awfully slow!,negative,5361780
What a fun bar downtown! The inside is tiny but its always a good time  Chill atmosphere with a DJ booth blasting fun music late at night  Drinks are a bit above average priced; between $5  $10 for beers and $10 for cocktails  Its never difficult to get a drink at the bar and the service hasnt disappointed yet  If youre bar hopping downtown  Id definitely recommend stopping by Vanguard  Dont forgot to check in for 20% off your first order!,positive,6302369
Absolutely wonderful  2nd time at Tupelo and it was amazing  Matt our server was attentive and kind  While service at the bar was slow our food was reasonable in timing  Matt was keeping us informed about what was going on  Our waters were always filled  The small plate of shrimp mac and cheese absolutely loved it  it is worth the carbs  The market fish (Corvina) with garlic risotto and tomatoes excellent  the balsamic flavor I believe it was on the tomatoes I could have done without  However  still good  My other two dining pals got the salmon and curried fried chicken  Salmon was gone  i saw the plate get there and i saw it empty moments later thats about it  Curried fried chicken  the pieces of chicken were rather small would have prefer one more piece and less sides  It was still delicious  The fried chicken is a boneless breast  which is more like chicken tenders not fried chicken  thats why we got salmon  To each thier own  For good southern food  I go to Tupelo ,positive,168056
Have eaten here several times and the food and service are always solid   My lunch the other day was their Dagwood sandwich which was excellent   I kinda like the place better before the remodel  and it is very nice but I like the dark wood look ,positive,1704373
Ruris is a FANTASTIC salon   Rebecca always gets my color perfect and my haircut just falls into place each morning with very little effort on my part   As the cut grows out  the precision of the cut continues to amaze me   When it comes to making an appointment  the salon goes out of their way to try to accommodate my schedule   The cost for these services would be a lot higher in Scottsdale and the quality and expertise not nearly as good   I highly recommend Ruris to all my friends; I get compliments on my hair where ever I go ,positive,4359594
Tucked away in a comic book store in the busy area of Dundas square is another perfectly good spot in the city to have a perfectly good cup to coffee  Would definitely recommend! Also a great spot to people watch out the windows facing yonge ,positive,5737870
Parking is not good and they have a process in place that makes it very hard to park yourself   The food was ok but not inspiring   Service was ok but not great and we went during happy hour   Overall it was ok but for over a hundred bucks I think it should be more than that   May go back but not likely,neutral,4176972
I love this place especially when you go in and try every flavour of popcorn ever   You can sweet or salty popcorn or even both Also the staff is super nice   They have excellent customer service   If you love popcorn and havent been there yet then you have to go cus you wont regret it   They also have vegan options which is a winner!!!,positive,2434555
Excellent food  Everything was delicious  In retrospect I feel like it was good quality because Mexican usually talks back to me but this did not  We have enchiladas  nachos  guac  chips and salsa  tacos  and quesadillas  Nachos were particularly good  Good location  fun atmosphere  appropriate lighting  very nice owner who walked around and interacted  Food came out quickly but not too quick  General service was a little slow  I think the waiter could have come to our table more often  We had trouble continuing to order drinks  But they were busy  We decided to continue drinking at another place  Happy hour is too short  It ends at 6  Most go until 7 and the best go until 8 ,positive,1042727

I have always been a fan of this Buffet  and Ive been to my share of them  I have to say overall this is the best on the strip  as least for me  Everything is freshly made and talk about selection   This place means buffet  You can choose from anything from your choice of freshly prepared pasta  to made to order omelettes  Chinese food  choice of seafoodcrab legs  scallops  shrimp  crawl fish  A delicious carving section of meats and of course for those who eat salads  a large selection of veggies and greens  all you can drink Mimosas and to top it off an assortment of desserts  all for a reasonable price of $18 95 per person  brunch is less ,positive,2182367
The manager at the front was absolutely amazing and SO kind and welcoming when I walked in  It was freezing cold and windy  and I wasnt sure theyd be able to get me in but the manager and employees said no problem with smiles on their faces  Service and work were great  I would come back here in a heartbeat  Thank you!,positive,4923798
The pho its self isnt bad at all  very little msg  decent meat/ home made meat balls  The problem with this place is the service  there is noooo service ! I would only come back if I was super desperate for pho  its nice to have your drink topped off or be spoke to with respect  It could have been worse  but it could have been MUCH better! For what ever reason the spring roll was a little off as well almost a slight taste of curry  and a few things I dont normally find In my spring roll  I didnt like it and my friend found it odd too    SERVICE IS KEY!!!!,negative,4958477
Absolutely the WORST service and food I have ever had  No one greets you  you wait 1520 min before they even give you a menu  Had brunch today and thats the last time Ill ever go  I gave them multiple chances  Got double wide eggs Benedict  and the eggs were not even remotely cooked  The yolk turned my plate into soup  and ruined everything else on the plate  Bartender admitted to being very hungover  Didnt prepare Bloody Mary properly  Dont waste your time here when there are so many other good places to eat on carson ,negative,164905
I definitely prefer the Hainanese chicken here over some of the restaurants in China Town ;) Generous portions  HK milk tea (hot) was flavourful and creamy as well ,positive,1996416
This place is amazing  Its a little hard to find from the outside  but the inside is a classic relaxation space  I see Jessica and she does great work  relaxing with enough pressure to work out the knots  After moving to the area my back was all out of whack but after a deep tissue massage I feel lighter and taller ,positive,5445732
I was there for a birthday party  and considering the size of the group the service was good   I find the food to be very commercial and please do not order the duck confit salad   It is a wilted grilled  heart of romaine (in one piece) with a piece of duck on it and a little bit of this questionable white sauce   I was completely turned off and just ate the duck  which was OK but have had way better   This should not be served as a salad dish  Thankfully I ordered the french onion soup as an entree   It was comforting  very salty but acceptable I will not be returning ,negative,2771777

Im clearly having a solidly three star experience here in Vegas I stopped in here for breakfast  I came at about 7:00 and even without a reservation I was seated immediately  I ordered a pretty basic breakfast of eggs over easy  wheat toast  coffee and bacon  The eggs were pretty uncooked when indie them and the white were runny  I will be looking for another place to eat breakfast while at the Venetian ,neutral,2910990

I really like the decor of this place  The Parisien style is also captivating  Ive been here 4 or 5 times  because I really wanted it to be my go to coffee spot  being canadian  and on the outside being fancier than Tim Hortons In the end however  the coffee is not great  I havent tried their other locations  but if its standard across the board  then its a bit disappointing  Perhaps their percolators use water thats too hot  so it scorches the beans  The end result is that its inferior to Starbucks  second cup  and even McDonalds and Tim Hortons So why 3 stars? Their espresso based drinks are still good  When they had the toasted almond latte  I did make an effort to get it as a treat  They also have good baked goods  Not my goto coffee shop if I find myself in this part of town ,neutral,2548066

The only reason I cant give this hotel five stars is because lets be honest Fairfield Inn is not a fivestar hotel  However this place is awesome and honestly the nicest Fairfield Ive ever stayed in  The staff is fantastic  the morning breakfast is awesome  the rooms are clean and comfortable  The location is ideal and the entire hotel is decorated beautifully  Im very impressed and highly recommend staying here for a comfortable visit for business travel  or a family vacation ,positive,4942121

I came here for lunch since my office is less than 10 minutes away   I had seen it many times while driving by and had been intrigued but never went in before   When I finally decided to pull the trigger  it reminded me of a cafeteria where you look at the sides you want   The chicken appears to be cooked daily so at least the food is fresh I ordered the dark chicken   It was tasty but nothing spectacular   With a side  the meal was a little less than $10   I thought it was too pricey for the quality  but the portions were pretty solid   You could definitely get away with creating at least one and a half meals  maybe two if you had two sides   I do not need to go back to Nevada Chicken Cafe anytime soon  but I would not have an automatic response of no if someone wanted to go ,neutral,1929563
Ive lived here for almost a year now    The price for a one bedroom flat is 1610 a month  If you have a pet its 350 one time deposit along with 45 a month payment  100 dollars extra a month for a an extra parking spot  vaulted ceilings shoot the energy bill up to at LEAST 100 a month  My flat is very pretty  but the one star isnt for the aesthetics  its for the service  If you complain about something  they are quick to defend themselves  My blinds completely fell three times  Once it took them three weeks to fix it so my blinds are all wrinkly  My friends ceiling leaked  her window popped out one windy day and almost hit her in the head  my light bulbs are always going out  the locks in my bedroom were broken when I moved in  my front door handle is so stiff  guests cant get in or out of my house lol  the hot tub infinity pool is broken often    Etc ,negative,3057660
Stumbled across this as I was perusing this location of a Premium Outlet The ladies whom work at this stand are quite friendly!  Samples provided on all they sell   BEST part is nothing is man handled  tongs are used and they are clean!  I purchased the pecans and coconut TUMMY!  The toasted coconut is tasty and a healthy snack! No additives or preservatives!!!  Its in an outlet mall  making it a planned out event of going and dealing with tourists (hence the four stars) ,positive,4625121
Ice cream was okay  can make it much better  I felt they have really less flavors to choose from  which I didnt like it much  They have only 1 chocolate flavored ice cream that was little more on dark side  I like more of milky chocolate which they didnt had  My ratings:Ice cream 3/5Service 1/5Ambience2/5Quality 3/5,neutral,3086487

I went here for the first time to get a waxing (brazilian) and I have to admit it was the worst experience ever! I had to wait for 20 mins until the technician was done with her previous appointment before me  Then we finally got started on my waxing  It took a total of 15 minutes for the waxing to get done  I almost punched the lady for being to rough on my waxing  I asked her what her hurry was  and she said it was because it was getting close to her lunch time  Are you freaking kidding me?! Supposedly she thought she was so great at her job  she gave me a $30 coupon for the next service with her  YEAH RIGHT! Ill happily drive over to North Las Vegas for a Brazilian any day because of the customer service and due to the fact that they will take their time and make sure you are comfortable while in their care  I seriously wish I could give this place zero stars  It is NOT worth this 4 star rating at all  Please do not waste your time or money on a wax here  trust me ,negative,2796434
Loved this place   Today Beth helped me and she was so kind  helpful  understanding and Insanely Knowledge able  Today I had a wonderful experience at Fantasia Crystals    They have excellent variety of supplies and their customer service was OUTSTANDING!!

I was running late  And almost flaked on my friends  but somehow I made it by midnight  Where else can you go somewhere fun this late in the night but in Vegas  There was a long line  But this is where being female is definitely an advantage   I give my flirty eye contact and it still boosts my ego tremendously each and every time it works  Two different guys in suits approach me; both offering me a warm smile letting me know to give him a minute   My friends had a table and were already in  I have to admit  it felt good to be escorted out of the long line into the dark swanky entrance into the club and to their table   The music and overall ambiance immediately got me out of my lazy mood and jolted my legs to want to dance  Definitely a fun night  Our table was close to the open view of the cool pool and the DJ; so it was perfect spot  I probably had too much to drink  but so what    I dont gamble  so thats my vice when Im in Vegas:),positive,2760050
I work in an Assisted Living community and had an independent resident order oxygen from this company  The delivery person arrived with 8 full tanks under his arms and between his fingers   When I asked that he take them out and put them in a secure carrier  I was told he didnt have anything to carry them in   I also asked if he knew what happens to these tanks if they are dropped and the nozzle is damagedhe said nothing will happen unless there is a fire (not true)   He also said fine  I will just leave then   Since the resident needed his oxygen  I sent him up anyway  but asked the resident and caregiver in the apartment about the delivery guyand was told he did not knock at all  just barged in and was very abrupt and rude to all   He stated he was a third party vendor and didnt have time for my issues   Pretty sad ,negative,2857480

This is Thai kicked up a notch  Expect great service  food that is well presented and garnished  and a personal and elegant atmosphere Great for a date night  or an impressive place to become a regular The family who owns the restaurant runs the restaurant and staffs the restaurant  Youre essentially a guest  eating in their home  From speaking to them  most seem to be from an engineering or highly educated technical background  and that attention to detail shows in their product and service Its one of the coolest place to know about  get to be a regular before all your friends do!,positive,5199803

This place is a hidden gem in my opinion  For $15 per person  it was a lot of food for two people  The food itself was delicious  perfectly charred  but I preferred the other fish over the tilapia  The taro ice cream was creamy and brought the meal together (this was extra  not part of the set meal)  I would highly suggest making a reservation in advance even if theres only 2 people going  They did get very busy  and they prioritized our reservation over walkins ,positive,5426745

The food here is amazing  Its one of those hole in the wall magical finds you are lucky to come across  Everything is amazingly fresh  The only thing I have to complain about is that I am only English speaking and their waitresses are only Spanish speaking so Im always a little embarrassed and feel like an outsider when I come but once you get past the language barrier the food is worth it and keeps me coming back  FYI the oysters are the freshest Ive ever tasted ,positive,4844035
After you sign the contract they will wash your hands with any issues you can have  I had to call corporate twice to get those issues resolved  First my original contract was wrong  they finally changed the payment due date to 45 days which it was promised during making the deal  I stopped by the dealer at least 3 times to make sure it was changed  Finally I received my first bill and it was with the wrong date  I stopped once again and John Greene promised to changed and to take care of everything  After a week a called myself the bank and they told me they never received a new contract  I tried to call John several times and he never took my calls or called me back  I spoke with a manager and he confirmed me that the payment due date was not changed  So I had to call corporate once again to take care of this  Now Im stuck with a late fee because they are so incompetent ,negative,213637
Steve came out to bid the job and was very knowledgeable and helpful   We were very satisfied with the quote and the work was scheduled quickly and to our convenience  Moses came out and did the whole project (garage conversion) in a day  He was polite  clean and an extremely hard worker  My husband tried to give him a little extra money for going above and beyond and he refused   We would definitely recommend King insulation ,positive,4591474

Amazing dairy free options!! Cashew  coconut or almond milk are all options with many many flavor options  Pretty impressed especially because I dont see it marketed towards vegans  We just randomly went in one night hoping they would have at least 1 dairy free option  Id say their milkshakes and sorbet are their best  The ice cream is good but not very sweet  which I like sometimes but doesnt appease a super sweet tooth  Great for kids though  We dont live in Mesa but always stop by when were in the area!,positive,270578

Im so disappointed   Im not a vegetarian but I do love my veggies   Ive eaten here many times and have rarely been disappointed   Today I cant say the same   I ordered my usual Beach Bowl and instead of eating in  I opted for take out   First off  they changed the packaging making the take out portion for the standard size that much smaller   When I got home I saw that I got a bigger portion of soba noodles with little veggies   I got two small pieces of grilled red peppers  two small slices of grilled sweet potatoes  two small slices of avocado and some greenery   I dont know what is happening with this restaurant  but they are on the cusp of losing a customer in me   Youd think that with the increase in price they would keep the portions the same  but that is not the case ,negative,2949155

Went there last weekend  I live close by so I tend to go here about 10 times a year or so  They closed one of their 9 holes down and turned it into an executive par 3 course  A very poorly constructed one to boot  For some reason the staff there has been fairly rude the last 3 times I went  One guy flat out told around 5 other golfers I screwed him up on the tee times and now everyone else is going to be backed up  Even if this is true  correct customer service would not be to go around yelling it to other customers  I wont be going back and predict this course will fall into the same category as so many others that eventually close down  who turns a nice regular golf course in scottsdale into an executive course?,negative,6267259

I came here needing shampoo and makeup wipes  They have makeup here but the cheap kind  I saw a lot of clothing but I just needed the necessities  As I entered  I got greeted Hello by the security here  They had nice selection of bags and clothes  The line was long but went by fast  The restrooms are in the back near the fitting rooms  Its like every other Ross  Lots of parking up front but be careful for all the speeders that drive by  A descent location with lots of stuff on sale ,neutral,1932989
Friendly service   The carnitas I ordered were tasty but were dry   The rest of the food was what we had come to expect from Macayos  Good salsa and friendly staff ,neutral,1290266
Dunk and dip is one of those places where you instantly feel like you are in a different mood the moment you walk through its doors  The amazing atmosphere that is  beautifully complemented by the elegant furniture will definitely unwind you  the singer that constantly serenades your ears with romantic songs will also help alot In addition to the friendly  polite  and smart staff that the restaurant has  the prices it offers can be hadly beaten  I have been there many times and never been disappointed once  The food they serve there is nothing short of topnotch  it is always freshly made and tastes great ,positive,960896
So this place is great    if youre trying to conceive with the devil  Pros: the rice was cooked?the pico de gallo contained matter of some dimensionality (of which I did not know)Cons:you have to burn all leftovers and burry the ashes between a oak tree and a rose bush  at 2:15am on a full moon  with a rabbi present otherwise THEY WILL RESPAWN,negative,4522328
The Sun Devils are back in the discussion this year finally and are off to a 71 start  Jahi is the real deal  This was my 2nd game at Wells Fargo arena and I liked this cozy arena  It is draped in ASU yellow and maroon and since ASU is the only tenant  they went all out with the pretty colors  Currently  the arena is barely half full  so walking up to get tickets  parking and managing crowds are not a problem  It is also very easy to parlay your $12 ticket into much better seating so far this season  Most shocking event of the night: saw a handful of scalpers out front  but they were white!,positive,4755566
Have heard about this place for years and finally tried it The ambiance is the best part   However at night it is quite dark to sit outside on the picnic benches   They really need more of the Christmas style lights   Parking is abundant but packed   The line was 24 minutes long on a Saturday night with only one employee taking orders   Food was just okay   Burger is very meaty tasting and thick   The fries were cold fast eating outside so might have been better if I could have eaten faster   My kid liked the pulled pork with sweet potato fries and coleslaw   The drink choices are different   Tasted all of them   Went with the root beer first but it had a strange aftertaste   Then tried the blood orange soda mixed with a bit of coconut soda   That was way better ,neutral,1705699
Its a very nice hotel at a affordable price  The rooms are very large  with lots of seating as well as a massive bathroom  The mini kitchen is a great add  It even has a blender! Make sure you buy your own water though because the hotel gives you super tiny bottles  The pool and fitness centre are both quite nice  The shuttle to Caesars was helpful and ran frequently  It ended at 12am though  which made it hard to catch the shuttle after a late show    Some people complained about rude valet and front desk staff  but I found everyone to be really friendly and helpful  The only downside was the train  I was on the 28th floor and the train was still super loud  But who comes to Vegas to sleep right?! This is a great hotel for anyone who wants to stay somewhere nice  but not pay nice hotel prices ,positive,3253318
The staff were super friendly  price was fair  and the kids had a blast!Only gripe was the bounce house had a hole and it could use a little TLC     the kids still enjoyed playing on it so it wasnt a huge deal! Oh  also  I really wish the older kids were supervised more closely as they get crazy (parents dont watch them) and its SUPER dangerous when they are pushing and shoving blocking the slide etc Overall: Recommend this place!,positive,5024162
I had my 2008 Toyota Solara detailed by these guys and they did an amazing job!! They worked on my car for over 3 hours and it looked show room new!! They steamed cleaned my engine  washed and waxed the exterior  shampooed the carpets  and cleaned the leather seats and the rest of the upholstery until it looked brand new  The price was very reasonable  and they were very professional  I highly recommend this company ,positive,2140473
So my experience was mediocre to say the least  The server I had and the greeter I had were not welcoming in the least  My server passed me by at least 5 times and I believe I waited 810 minutes before I could have my order taken  This is all while every other table including ones that came after me were receiving service  Im very patient but I do peep things  The only reason my review has three stars is because the food was so good  I would recommend getting your food to go or another server  I cant tell you who I had because she didnt even tell me her name now that I think of it  But the more mature Asian waitress with the bob hair cut was very nice and got me my check and to go box promptly  Probably will try other places before going back here ,neutral,4513438
My local friends picked this restaurant for a get together/dinner after not having seen each other for many years   While the restaurant got busy  they did not mind we stayed at our table talking and drinking for hours   We shared the Jamaican jerk wings  quesadilla  and empanadas   All were winners  and on happy hour sale pricing!  We opted for salads and my Cobb was delicious  large  crisp  fresh and tasty!  Beer COLD on a very hot day and our waiter  Marshall  was top notch  attentive  and friendly!  Top marks for a relaxing  fun evening meal ,positive,3787702

Located in Treasure Island  this transplant from Memphis is a great spot  A wide selection of BBQ and lighter fare for those of you who refuse to enjoy yourselves  There is a Foursquare check in special: Three Dollar Budweiser and Bud Light drafts! Try the Hog Wings  think Buffalo Wings but made from pork shanks  these are unreal  Also I should point out scantily clad waitresses (thats for those of you not into BBQ and Foursquare specials)  Wait at least an hour after eating before riding the mechanical bull!  Live it up you are in Las Vegas for cryin out loud!,positive,3446007
I dont like thai food  and this place turned me off completely,negative,2024306
Other reviewers have already commented about the sewage smell that on occasion tends to linger through the restaurant on certain days   Ive been here often enough to see this place go downhill fast   The last time I went (in December) there was a notice on the door that the health district had shut it down for a cockroach infestation   I wanted to puke  Id been eating food from their kitchen!   It has since reopened    but for obvious reasons I will never return   Beware of seriously unsanitary food methods if you choose to eat here ,negative,4121279
Im actually a pretty big fan of this place as Ive been coming here since the casino used to be Aladdin  I think it offers the most variety of buffet foods in all of Las Vegas and is priced reasonably for such a huge selection  All of their foods are also decently good so it is a filling and satisfying meal ,positive,2906352
Was too blown away by the view from the 50something floor of TheHotel @ Mandalay Bay   This has got to be the best view of the strip   Hands down   Classy club  classy crowd  notsoclassy music (hence lose one star)   We had to wait for a bit at the front but it wasnt unbearably long   Once were in  we knew why there were such a big crowd outside waiting for the bouncer to grow a heart and let them in   This has a feel of a lounge more than a club  The dance floor was a bit small  and the majority of the area is filled with couches and a narrow walkway between the couches and the bar   If you have an expense account getting a table service is a must ,positive,5930027
4 years later I still enjoy this place   other than the classics like koshary  foul and falafel   their om Ali is to die for and their fatta is one hell of a filling meal,positive,55455
Decent barbeque  but at the fare and portion size it leaves us hanging  Taste was solid and fresh; dinner entrees come with two sides I got the double meat combo and for a man that likes to eat BBQ  I was not completely satisfied  That nagging feeling of unfulfilled promise persisted all through the evening  At $13 a pop  I can get more promise from a Texas Roadhouse dinner ,neutral,824186
Signing up with Aptive was the biggest mistake Ive ever made  Before they came to my house Ive only had a minor ant problem and spraying Raid always worked  But they said it is not safe for my baby and my pets  So I signed with them    Its been a couple of months since Aptive treated my house and its a total nightmare  I have Ants everywhere  in my bathtub  in my shower  in my toilet  all floors are covered in them    Dead and alive  Even spraying Raid doesnt work anymore  To make the matter worse  when I called to cancel my services they billed me $180 for cancelation  They turned my life in a nightmare and I am the one who has to pay!!!!!! My advice  do not ever sign up with these guys  because you will have a hard time getting rid off not just ants but Aptive too ,negative,4444161
Love the Pick 2 lunch option! You get the best of both worlds by choosing two items from the soup  salad and sandwiches  Its plenty of food for a lunch break and all of their prices are very reasonable ,positive,3487460
Me and my boyfriend go here pretty much every weekend on Sunday for breakfast because its right across the street  This place is old school  Its like it got stuck in the 70s and never updated anything  The service is always great  CHEAP prices  The food comes out really fast and is always good  The only change I would make is to update the building somewhat and clean a little more and thoroughly  Overall though love this place just dont expect anything fancy or modern ,positive,3594214

My baby boy Charlie needed an over night sitter for this passed weekend   it was last minute   and everywhere I called required him to get a flu shot and another shot which I forgot what the name of and they were at $25 each not Including the fee for him to stay over night   I found North Paws Ranch on yelp and I am so happy I did ! The prices were super affordable ! My dog was very well taken care of   and hes not use to being around other dogs but when i picked him up I can tell he had so much fun  he was the most active iv ever seen him   Rhonda and her husband were super nice and welcoming to myself and my baby! I was scared about leaving him somewhere else that wasnt his home over night but just speaking to Rhonda and getting information from her made me feel a lot more secure and I just knew I can trust that he would be okay ! I will for sure be bringing him back ! Thank you guys again so very much !,positive,3653881
HORRIBLE DO NOT STAY HERE! Terrible customer at check in they gave you NO instructions on the parking garage or the room!! and you have to go down an escalator with all of your luggage because they wont take it at drop off  After 2 HOURS for check in process we are finally in our room and it smells terrible like smoke and the guy next to us is yelling and you can hear every word! The phone does not work! DO NOT STAY HERE!Asking for a refund!! All the employees are horrible and stand around doing nothing!,negative,1619930

While making a reservation I was looking at a picture of two queen beds  Perfect! Checked in  arrived at the room and searched for another queen bed like in the picture  The bed  like in the picture  did not exist  Called down to the front desk to let them know they must have put us in the wrong room  I was then told the couch was indeed  technically  a bed  I was then told the hotel was sold out and there was nothing they could do  Not cool! If I could give this place no stars  I would  This review will do nothing other than    Well probably nothing  Lol  Oh    And the pool is empty  Bring your skateboard ,negative,6382106
Tough to call this one  While I appreciate the heart strings the Lakeview has on its regulars  the fact remains my experience there was nothing above pat $4 caesars always help  but a foul smelling burger wont have me lining up again  but Ill take the blame for ordering that one during brunch (at 1pm no less)   ,negative,5712223

So far Sunkist Pools/Rocky are great!

I would give this business zero stars if I could   I hired them to clean my apartment for an important event and I came home right before the event was to occur to a dirty house and a note saying they couldnt actually clean my house today   They never attempted to call me to let me know  just left this note   Ridiculous  I would strong discourage anyone from using this service ,negative,2865497

Used this service to order lunch from Banh Mi Boys for the office last week   Food arrived within the agreed time frame  We were charged approx $20 00 including surcharge and tip for the delivery which we felt was more than reasonable given that they were delivering 14 sandwiches from Gerrard St to Toronto St   We were charged double that amount by Bellybuster for delivery of the same amount of sandwiches  For this reason I would definitely use them again ,neutral,5783055
I dig Yolies  It isnt the best Brazillian steak house I have been to but I have never been disappointed  Not a lengthy review but its just a place you have to try once and if its for you it is if its not it not  I guess thats the epitome of mediocre lol,neutral,2004840
We tried True pizza for the first time during lunch and it was a big hit with the family  You order first and they give you number card to take to your table  Theres ample seating in and outside of the restaurant (covered and on the large sidewalk)  We sat by the pizza station so the kids could watch pizzas being made  We ordered the classic cheese pizza for the kids  a white pizza for the two of us and a Caesar salad  They brought us our drinks and food  and throughout our meal multiple staff stopped by to check on us The pizzas were delicious and I would say 1 pizza and a salad could easily be shared by two people  The kids loved the pizza but its definitely a firmer/chewier crust that required a lot of effort for my little one to bite off pieces  My only suggestion would be to use less dressing or have it on the side because the salad was pretty drenched in it We would return!,positive,6117989
Cheap  Filling  Fast  The largest bowl of noodles can easily be split by two people for dinner  While the restaurant is small  service is friendly and efficient  If youre struggling with your noodles  dont be afraid to ask the server for a pair of scissors to cut it up  they know the drill  Given that this location is right downtown  expect there to be long wait at lunch or dinner  (And expect to be waiting outdoors ) You should be fine if you can avoid those peak times  The menu is small  Ive skipped the appetizers every time and gone straight for the rich broth and noodles  Also  shout out to the guy standing in the kitchen pulling those noodles  count me impressed ,positive,723063

This is by far the best Mexican food in town  My husband and I have wanted to try it for awhile but I was always a little scared because every review kept saying how different it was and Im a bit of a picky eater  But OMG its freaking amazing  Get the Al Pastor  whatever style you want  but definitely chose the Al Pastor as your meat  Weve been here twice now and have loved it both times  Its very clean  staff is very friendly and accommodating  food is amazing and they have a great salsa bar  What else can you really ask for?,positive,5256828

This is a small cozy restaurant that serves mainly okomiyaki  You can see the chef cooking your food across the room  I ordered the beef okonomiyaki with extra bonito flakes and seaweed which was savory but nothing really impressive  Whats impressive is their customer service who sees to it you get what you need and keeps their distance while u eat  They are very friendly and attentive  I would go back to try other food ,positive,5237987

I had lunch there today and the service and food were amazing  Ernesto was our server and he was on top of everything  I never asked for a refill because he was right there with a new one  I had the eggplant Parmesan and it was a 1000 times better than Brio  I love eggplant and stopped getting it at brio because the quality of food has seriously gone downhill there  The only complaint I had was that the food could have been hotter  But I saw it come out of the window and tight on to the tray and to our table so I know it wasnt the server  Ive waited tables for awhile and notice EVERYTHING  I actually cant wait to return and have the yummy cheesecake Ernesto suggested  This is the best food and service Ive had in a WHILE ,positive,2139779
I visited the salon this afternoon and got a blowout  The experience was good  Lourdes has reasonable prices and uses salonquality products  such as Sebastion and Salerm  The salon was not very busy when I was there  which worked out great for me  because she was able to do my hair right away  My blowout came out straight  Also  she does not do a whole lot of unnecessary pulling and tugging of your hair  She listens to you requests and offers her own suggestions  And yes  she does speak English!! The salon is clean and she accepts credit/debit cards  I had an overall positive experience ,positive,2683772

This is my first time at Loving Hut and eating Vegan  It was good  I will probably be back if my vegetarian employees want to come again  The service was great and the food is made to order  so I can take awhile for it all to come out if you have a large party  I ordered the pad Thai  It was good  but they used the wrong type of noodle  The noodle in my dish was more for pad see yu instead of pad Thai (which is a thin noodle)  Still good ,positive,5283353
Went here with friends to grab a few drinks   The it was early and not that packed but grew as the night went on   Pretty soon it was packed but service was good even with crowd and the prices were reasonable and they have a pretty good draft list   A good place to get your drink on with a crowd of rowdy friends ,neutral,6245681

After a friend was raving about this place  I decided to give it a try  not once but twice  The nail technician I was placed with  did a great job on my nails    it was the longest lasting gel manicure I have ever received  But the staff fell short  The lady working the front  is not very friendly and the technicians do not engage in any conversation with anyone  The salon was pretty quiet the whole time  I figured it must have been the time I went ( towards the end of the day almost closing) So 3 and a half weeks passed and went and I needed another manicure so I decided to try this place again  same thing   great nails but the staff just is not very friendly ,neutral,178192
Worst service ever! On over a dozen times in the last 12 months  The most recent appointment was a week ago  I have had the following issues  #1 making an appointment  only to have it canceled when I arrive to the office  #2 waiting over 2 hours after my appointment to be seen  Every time I have an appointment  Even though I make all my appointments for first appointment of the day #3: being put on hold several times  and an hour later  just to schedule an appointment  #4: Being cussed out by staff  when I didnt say a word to anyone  #5: they told my child to shutup cause he cried during the appointment  #6 not being able to get an appointment  less than 4 months in advance  Its ridiculous If it werent for my insurance  I wouldnt come here   But I have no choice  Please go anywhere but here ,negative,6446874
This is probably a special occasion type of place  but the food is great and service is pleasant  Probably a great place for a date  I think its Japanese owned  which is rare nowadays for a sushi restaurant  unless ive been fooled and its Korean or Chinese owned  but the sushi chef spoke Japanese as did the servers  The servers wear kimonos too which is cute  The meals (soup  chicken kaarage  salad  tempura  and main entree  noodles or sushi) are great  and they come with alot of food  Its a little pricy  but you get good quality with it ,positive,5319253

I havent been here in a few years and just decided on a whim to come   There were 4 in our party   The food is just a delicious as I had remembered   We had the calamari as a starter  fruiti misti pizza  pepperoni pizza  Chilean sea bass and seafood risotto   All delicious and service is excellent!,positive,2297825
I tried my first sushi burrito here   It was decent and it was a novel experience  but I would not say it was as mouthwatering as others describe it to me   The portion size was great  but I found that because it was slightly larger than the burritos at other establishments  I had some difficulty keeping all the filling between the seaweed near the bottom   This could just be my inexperience with handling sushi burritos  mind you   I had the salmon sushi burrito and it was ok  It tasted like an average salmon avocado maki roll from a decent Japanese restaurant   The ingredients were fresh  but I would not say they wowed me   There is a high diversity of ingredients that make up the filling  but for me  I found that it had too much going on compared to the fillings at Mihito   Given the location of Rolltations branches  I would still highly recommend people to give these burritos a go if they are curious about this new fad!,neutral,2649364
I am a huge fan of Korean cuisine and have been craving an authentic restaurant that rivaled my favorite East Coast eateries for some time now  Well my prayers have been answered!!

Let me start off by saying our server was great  Now to the food  I ordered the crab Benedict  When it came to the table I was starving at it looked amazing  Looks are deceiving  The first egg I cut into was hard boiled  No runny yolk at all  The second egg I cut into was completely runny egg whites which I did not notice till a couple bites in  They were nice and took it off the bill but Im still starving  On a side note my husbands food had to have been sitting there for a long time before being served  For a high class place it was horrible ,negative,3418269
Hi  I had a horrible time at this restaurant  I used to love this place and they ruined it for me  They couldnt get the porterhouse cooked right  First  they switched the Temps on my prime rib and her portehouse  so her porterhouse came out med rare and my prime rib came out med well  They turned to fix it and couldnt get her porterhouse cooked right  Finally  they just offered to take the porterhouse off the check  I would hope so! It wasnt eaten at all  This whole experience was crap  The only reason Im giving them three stars is because of the busses edgar  He did an amazing job  He truly made the experience bearable ,neutral,1736798
Came late night with a party of 13 people called ahead and they had a table ready for us  Since it was late we were able take advantage of happy hour prices on a few items which was great  we ordered a few pitchers of Sangria and variety of tapas everything was excellent  the tapas that stood out to me were the may y tierra skewer  patatas bravas and my wife enjoyed the croquetas  Service was good and attentive would definitely go back,positive,690133

I like the small venue and some of the costumes  or lack there of were ok  but the show is too slow paced  I found the two guys with the comedy dance routine in the middle of the show to be the best part  definitely woke me up  I am not knocking these girls  they are pretty and you may seem some beaver  but I found it to lack sexiness  And the part with the woman dancing and only her hips down are showing  was extremely slow  boring  and not all that sexy  And the lady who comes out and dances between scenes isnt that great either  Kind of corny if you ask me  no one eve knows if they should clap for her or not  Most chose not  I think all chose not  The part I did like is that they use colored and shaped lights to project on the womens body  something that a certain DIVA at Encore stole for her show  If you can find a discount ticket  which you can  then go ahead in see this show ,negative,2352545

This is a great place  Mr  McCoig is wonderful martial artist and a coach  He makes sure that every kid gets his attention he gives children that drive  interest in the sport  He is thoughtful and respectful to children  Every lesson is different;  he makes sure that kids have fun  play challenging games and learn at the same time   Also he teaches children to be respectful and thankful to parents  I am extremely grateful  to find this place; my son learned a lot about martial art In the short period of time  Special thanks to Mrs  Susie who makes the  place cozy and warm by being so sweet and great with parents and kids  I definitely recommend Results Martial Arts to anybody!,positive,5220710
Ive lived in the area for just over a year  One of my biggest concerns when I left Michigan was leaving behind relationships that Id had for years  I spoke to my vet of nearly 30 years to understand how to pick a new veterinary practice  Key to the process of choosing was that the hospital had to be certified by the American Animal Hospital Association  After careful consideration and due diligence for our two cavalier King Charles spaniels I selected the Animal Medical Center of Deer Valley  The staff is friendly  caring and knowledgeable  Ive found the practice for my pets for the next 30 years ,positive,3058685
Visited Native Grill on a Saturday night for the UFC fight  We arrived around 5:45pm  We sat outside on the patio where there wasnt too big of a crowd compared to inside  Our server was horrible during our whole duration of being there! We stayed until the end of the UFC fight which was about 10:30pm or so  A good 4 hours or more of bad service! She took extremely long with our drink orders  Forgot to put in our food order and came by to check on us every 45 mins or longer and makes a comment such as you drink fast  I wanted to say  no  youre just slow We ordered two half dozens of wings  (Teriyaki and chicken and waffles) But after almost 5 hours and between the 3 of us we were still hungry  We didnt want to order anymore food there because of the horrible service and the thought of having to wait an hour for the food  After the fight we chose to dine elsewhere for dinner  Service could use some work ,negative,5869344
My favorite Mexican restaurant  Its NOT the kind that serves the slop bucket side of rice & refried pinto beans with 1lb of melted 3 cheese blend on it  My parents were visiting AZ and went here twice in 1 week ,positive,3700708
My preferred place for robatayaki in town   Better pricing and flavor than raku   Service is friendly and fast  food is ultra tasty   The kiddos really enjoy this place due to the fact that skewered food is novel!,positive,3802947
Andrew Lundsford from Signature Reality achieved my goal and sold the home in 30 days  They have great communication and are easy to talk to   Answered all my questions and concerns  Also marketed my home more aggressively than the other homes   They are awesome and I would highly recommend them ,positive,312254
My husband picked up pizza from here and a chicken sandwiches  The pizza is soggy and the sauce is not good and you can tell the chicken is fake ,negative,3781214
I wrote a review about this place before but it looks like they are able to remove the bad reviews   In short this place is horrible   Do not eat here unless you enjoy paying a  lot for bad food but great service   And shame on yelp that allows these guys to remove bad reviews ,negative,2882443
I love you Changing Hands  My admiration began way back in Tempe over 20 years ago  I love browsing through the aisles and looking at the staff picks  They always have great recommendations  I also love the people that work there  They are extremely helpful and always up for chatting about books or other hot topics  I have found many a gift there as well  They always have cute little trinkets  funny journals  unique jewelry and wind chimes  There are fun spots to sit and briefly skim through books Now they sponsor the Storytellers events as well  Once a month brave new voices get up and tell a story to whatever theme has been preselected  I could go on and on but you really should stop in and try it out for yourself ,positive,2463469
This place has fallen off  At one time my family were regulars  The final straw was our last trip  The place was cold literally freezing we mentioned it to the manager & we simply got a shrug of the shoulders  The place is filthy  The restroom is on the same level as a porta jon  The wings are so small they shouldnt have even been plated  We mentioned this to our waiter he simply said they changed vendors  Will never be back!,negative,5405978
Truly Great restaurant  If your into accomplished intricate flavors this place rocks  Love the wine store next door  We go every time were in town,positive,5731849
WOW  I just got a talking to by the manager for shopping around for the best price  I called in to do a comparative price on a deal i have he actually told me that people like me get him upset  calling dealer to dealer to make someone low ball an offer  I asked him  am I suppose to take the 1st offer I get and say I bet this is the best i can do  he did not like that and told me that and basically told me to take my business elswhere,negative,5889893

From fresh groceries  gift bags  to school supplies!I was so shocked that they had fresh produce here  wish they have that back home in Oakland!Potatoes  watermelons  tomatoes  lettuce  bird food  toberlone chocolate  tooth paste  etc! Theyve got it!!,positive,5671278
Maybe I am just not good at choosing food off menus  but shouldnt every item be good? I came here for dinner with a bunch of friends and yes  we were a large party (maybe 20 people?) but still that doesnt mean the service should suffer  I had the seafood chowder  $30  Was it good? Well  it was ok  Worth $30? No  Two of my friends shared the big bird and wow   it was a real juicy chicken  But again  worth $50? No  Service was mediocre  at best  My water glass was filled sometimes and our server dropped a shell on my lap when taking my bowl away  And of course an 18% gratuity was added automatically  It was super dark in there  too  Im going to give this place 2 stars because the chicken was real good  and the washroom was nice but everything else? Standard financial district food  mediocre service   I wont be back ,negative,3588658
Great amenity for a company to have   The staff is friendly and does a great job   Both the management and Chef are very accessible and visible in the cafe and for the many catered events that I have attended    Food is innovative for a company cafe enKeep up the good work!,positive,1422926
Im torn between 34 stars only because in the many times I have been there  the choice of cupcakes has been an excellent variety  And  they are absolutely appealing to the eye! Adorable and perfect for special occasions! However  I will need to start broadening my horizons  These are just too sweet  There is absolutely no way you can eat all the frosting or finish a cupcake  Out of the 5 of us  not one finished a whole cupcake  Not possible  Eating half can still bring on a belly ache  But the cake inside was really tasty! Especially the flavors with fillings!,neutral,3169490
Ive eaten at this chain in a few other casino locations in Las Vegas and I have to say its so much better to go to one of the free standing locations  The restaurant chain has been featured on several food tv shows and it certainly lives up to the hype  The food tastes great and their playing skills are above par  Each meal is big enough to feed 2 or more people do go hungry and dont go if youre on a diet! On my visit I got the mixed berry with granola pancake  It was amazing  Im definitely going to put granola in my pancakes at home  Will definitely come back!,positive,3040842
This place was amazing!  The pita was so hot  I had to wait a minute to eat it   I had a greek salad and it was good  no complaints   A colleague stated it was the best gyro she had ever had   The service was wonderful too!  This is definitely worth it!  The prices arent bad too!,positive,5547031

I have been going to the dentist every year my whole life  I had switched between insurances and hadnt been in a year in a half  I have had probably 4 cavities total my whole life and I went into this dentist and the Dr  told me that I have 12 cavities that need to be filled and said with my insurance (which is really great insurance btw) it would be around $700  I immediately made an appointment for a second opinion and that dentist said I have 2 cavities that needed to be filled  I will not go back to this place  They were nice but theres just no way I went from 12 cavities to 2 cavities ,negative,2207057
I was very excited to visit this brewery as its fairly close to my house and they had a great Groupon special for a beer flight  However  I was fairly disappointed and only enjoyed four of the eight beers  They have a long bar and large table for seating along with games to play with friends while drinking  Its minimally decorate  but works well with the atmosphere  They do have select Paninis available from a local shop down the road that might be worth checking out ,neutral,2778025
There are many reasons why Baguette Cafe is listed on Yelps 100 best places to eat! This locally owned and family operated business is possibly the best breakfast place Ive ever been to! Their croissants and quiche are made daily and they truly cannot be beat I ordered the Croissant & Egg with Ham which has swiss cheese omelette  spinach  tomato basil sauce  and ham  The croissant was flakey and delicious and the sandwich as a whole was savory with each flavor popping out of it  All of the ingredients are fresh and madetoorder The employees are all very friendly and knowledgeable  They can describe any menu item to you and probably give you some history behind why the item is on the menu too  Baguette Cafe offers daily specials as well  Ill be sure to stop here every time I am in Vegas ,positive,5068170
We love the Palms Place  The secret is to rent directly from an owner thru VRBO or HomeAway  When you rent from an owner  you get balcony access (you wont otherwise) and the rooms and furniture are better maintained  We like the balcony for the nice views of the strip and for smoke breaks  Since most guests dont have balcony access  nobody notices  There is a connector from Palms Place to the Palms Casino  We like going to the Movie Theater at the Palms  Its behind the food court which offers cheap eats  There are good slots and tables near the theater  There is also a 24 hour eatery past the reception area that has the best chicken and waffles  Its a quick Uber ride to the Strip  Or you can take the free shuttle to Caesars  We pay $299 a night for a 1 450 sq ft  condo with a full kitchen  And the Studios typically run $199 a night  You cant beat it ,positive,6068737
Our Bartender  Crystal  extremely nice and attentive   But not overly attentive  which I like   Meal of the day Coors light beer and 1000 island Burger one with sweet potato chips one with onion rings   This burger normally comes with two patties    one patty is enough for a female   Buns were fresh  Our meal did seem to take a while to arrive  the place had about a dozen people   Came Monday around 1 pm  Burger was cooked medium and juicy  Sweet potato chips were crispy   Mine was perfect as I dont like my food piping hot   My friend also had the burger  burger was again good   Onion rings seemed to be made and battered in house   Her onion rings and burger where not hot enough for her hence losing a star   Clean environment   Guenoc  Pinot gringo house wine is pretty good  If they could serve things just a little warmer   I think it could be a winner    Will come back when busy ,positive,4122998
amazing esp on fries  they are so fresh and crisp despite the meat and sauces on them!! yumm!!,positive,6557113
Their pizza is VERY good! Love their Sicilian style pizza  I havent tried any of their other menu offerings  but will do so next time Im there I bent the rules a bit  When you leave the pizza shop  turn left and sit on a little cafe table around the corner in front of Gallaghers restaurant  They offer a full bar and a wider selection of beer  The cafe tables are a great place to people watch  too ,positive,5061922
This is the first pizza place where I havent eaten the pizza  My visits usually consist of the spring salad with their madeinhouse dressing and either a sandwich or pasta  Every sandwich is excellent and filling no matter which you choose The atmosphere is excellent with sports on in the backround and this Nellos location has the friendliest wait staff out of all of them ,positive,5342135
I ordered the western burger and fries and really enjoyed both  Loved the ketchup bar  The milkshakes are on the thin side for the price  The service was friendly and attentive   I would visit them again ,neutral,2516362
Tim was great!  He came out to my home for a second opinion and confirmed my suspicions that another AC company was scamming me into unneeded repairs   And he did so at no cost!  He responded to my inquiry within the hour and was out to look at my unit the next day   I truly appreciate the time and attention he gave me  an unpaying customer   He will be my first call for additional maintance and repairs needed in the future!  Thank you Tim!,positive,5670304
Danish Pastry the way it should be! If you ever wonder why everyone raves about how good their pastry in Denmark  I really suggest coming here for a taste without flying there! This is as close as the real thing!They imported a special machine that able to make a fresh baked Danish dough with no less than 27 meltinyourmouth layers  27 layers! One bite is all you need  specially you love how light and flaky it is!We got 6 different ones to try  They were so good and we finished 3 on the spot and I just kept staring at them when I got home as I just want to have them all right away  I already request to have a stop next time when I am in the area or just make a special detour  They are just that good!PS  Try one of their coffee make fresh from the special beans imported from Copenhagen  perfect to go with one of their pastries!,positive,814796

Horrible staff members at the office  the dispatcher Pamela is very rude and aggressive lady  She uses inappropriate jargon on the phone and literally told me to shut up  and hang up the phone  When i called back she put me on speaker and was rude to me and the driver  I feel very terrible that someone yelled at me on the phone  When i asked if i could speak to the manager she said I am the manager  you have a problem?  Customer service is below 0  The driver was very nice and professional his name is Oliver ,negative,1777793
We stopped in here to meet friends for dinner and cocktails    They were a little late so we ordered the tuna for an appetizer and wine and beer   The tuna appetizer was not that tasty and the wine wasnt really that good either    I just didnt like the vibe in this place so I talked them in to going to Texas De Brazil instead for dinner   I would never go back here   It is inexpensive though  thats the only good thing ,negative,6111817
I was pleasantly surprised when i walked inside this place   On the outside  you would think this is a low key type traditional restaurant   Turned out to be a very clean well run establishment  packed w/ regulars   Food was very good  in the same league as stalwarts like Golden Court and Ambassador   My only disappointment  just a slight one  is that the $$ rating assigned is not that accurate   Maybe for Dim Sum  its a moderate priced restaurant   On this Saturday evening which I visited  the prices were more like $$$  so Yelpers take note  theres a discrepancy there   But if you are looking for good quality Cantonese food in this part of Markham and dont wish to venture further north to Hwy 7 or Bayview Richmond Hills  this would be a great choice   I shall follow up with a Dim Sum report if I can swing by during the week ,positive,2749704
Been here twice in the past few days  The first time ate lunch from the breakfast menu and it was very good  generous portions and tasty  Second time ate from the lunch menu and it was excellent! Amazing bagel sandwiches with a choice of sides including some awesome  and unique  salad choices  Being able to bring home freshly baked bagels an added bonus!,positive,477722
Just a great place   Food is consistently spot on  no matter what you order   Pastas  pizza  salad   Its incredibly difficult to decide because everything really is that good! You cant beat the prices either and the wait staff has always been great   Its nice to know that no matter when you go or what you order  that youre going to have a pleasant meal     Cant decide?  The roasted brussel sprout and beet salad is something that  once you have it  youll CRAVE it!  The spicy green bean salad is pretty awesome too   The Asparagus and Mushroom pasta  pizza  bread  rustica  chicken limone      all pretty darn good ,positive,3318248

In college (many moons ago)  I remembered coming here and thinking how hip and cool everything was   Now  returning with my 14 year old daughter  I realize that they do a great job just recycling trends from 20 years ago and marketing the hell out of it   I had to chuckle to myself when I came across Champion sweatshirts  Fila bucket hats and Converse sneakers in the store   With that said  the store staff is helpful  the racks are well organized  and my daughter can feel that she is trendy even though she doesnt know that I was rocking the same Champion sweatshirt in a basement party on Langdon in 93 ,positive,3177037

Cheap and best   We recently moved and we did our research and decided to buy our sofa set from here The store was a little hard to locate  Greg  the sales guy was very helpful in making our selection  He explained everything patiently and in detail about what kind of couch would better work for our family and how to maintain them  We decided on a particular sofa set and we were told that the delivery will take up to 14 days  But we got our couch on the third day itself and their delivery team was also great  We love our new couch and we will recommend this store to anyone looking for cheap and best furnitures  They also have catalogs from which we can order  Their prices are also very reasonable ,positive,720862
Surprised all the remnants of the former Minder Binder restaurant were gone but happy to try a new place   Seated outside  courteous service and the food was delicious and very reasonably priced  I had the small plate green chili Mac and cheese and had to take 1/2 home it was so much  Waitress was super nice and efficient    Ok why only 3 stars? Because I dont want to eat while listening to music which constantly has words such as mother fuc     bitc  ass  nigg  r   Super offensive  ya  its the trend (I guess) but I am not trendy enough to want to hear gross profanity while I eat   For sure dont bring your parents here or anyone else you care to impress ,neutral,4658913
Since moving to Charlotte I have been searching for the right Mexican Restaurant  I lived in Wilmington  NC and I had a specific spot to fulfill my Mexican food cravings  I was hesitant at first on ordering from here  but Im grateful that I did  The food is excellent  as well as the staff  The portions and prices are fair  This has become my spot for Mexican food in Charlotte!,positive,4453314
WARNING: Just took my puppy in to have her nails trimmed  Rather than cutting the curved bit at the end  the lady butchered my dogs foot by cutting right into the quick at the thickest part of her nail  Blood was going everywhere as my dog screamed and cried  The lady said it was no big deal and tried to continue trimming but we stopped her and left the other 3 paws undone  30 minutes of compress and one ruined shirt later and the wound finally stopped bleeding  Incredible negligence and blase attitude for a small pup who just had her nerve ending cut into  Never coming back  Be warned ,negative,5881255
The staff is very professional and their rates are very competitive as well  My little puppy  a 120 lb Rottweiler  is groomed by Rachel  Rachel is awesome with Newman and I have no problem leaving him in her care  My neighbors will compliment him on his coat all the time  Theres nowhere else I will take my dog  If you have a large dog or any size dog  Bark Place will take good care of your little puppy or in my case my little moose ,positive,5021337

This is a wonderful show  Frederick is a master of his craft  The showroom is small so every seat is good  He gets the audience involved immediately and holds their attention throughout  The demonstrations are completely amazing  The audio and video support is fantastic especially for such a small room  The time flew by and we were thoroughly entertained  I was also impressed that Frederick took the time to really meet people after the show  This was not the obligatory fake smile  buy a tshirt event  He sells nothing  but takes time to meet and chat with everyone  We had a great time and highly recommend this show ,positive,5245489
only gets one star because service was horrible  Food is fairly good  I walked in with my husband and sat at the bar  We were there for late night and we were asked by the guy bartender to move to the corner if we werent drinking  I wanted to leave right away like who does that? Then he sat 2 girls in our spot and they didnt even have a drink!! none the less he completely ignored us and I swore I would not return to this place,negative,6620449
Im so happy I found this place  Las Vegas has become saturated with bad med spas that are insanely overpriced  This place is the real deal  Heather is so sweet and honest  Her practice shows so much integrity because she would never do more than what looks perfect for profit  She explains everything so well and you always leave happy with results  I will never go anywhere else!!!

We flew from Vancouver  B C   Canada to Los Angeles  on Air Canadas Rouge (their economy airline)  The flight was generally good  but the seating was awful  The pitch (distance between seats) is 19  which is about the smallest it can ever get  For anyone over 56  be prepared to sit scrunched up with your knees flat up against the seat in front of you  And if the guy in front of you leans his seat back  you may as well stand all the way to your destination  No other airline that I have flown uses such a restrictive seating configuration  They need to rethink their economy layout ,negative,5993669
This place is a hidden jewel to all the tourist  if you are looking for a tradtional authentic mexican restaurant then this is the place  the owner came from Michoacan  Mexico and they know how to cook from homemade tortillas to everything on the menu  You can not go wrong with nothing on this menu they even bring you chips  homemade beans  and salsa in the beginning i would recommend this to anyone  Great food  Great service  and TRUE mexican food ,positive,5427670

I usually come here for dinner as it is my favourite Greek restaurant to eat at on the Danforth   The service is quite good and there isnt usually a long line up to deal with as the restaurant is fairly large and can fit quite a few people inside Most of the food is great and I usually order the pork or lamb souvlaki plate in large   The small plate is actually not that much smaller so you can always order that and still be quite full   The meat is always nicely cooked to perfection and if you have any issues they are quick to fix it   They also give you a generous portion of Greek salad along with your choice of sides with your order   I usually go with the rice and potatoes and that leaves me nicely stuffed by the end   I believe their portions are the largest out of any of the Greek restaurants in the GTA area and it keeps ne coming back for more Ill definitely drop by again if I am ever in the area ,positive,2673027
Rent from Jack! First went to Budget and felt like I was negotiating to buy a car for 45 minutes of upselling  Tired and upset with Budget I went next door to Avis where Jack attended us  No upselling  No pressure  A guy with a quirky charisma  Made us very comfortable to do business with that our blood pressure came down and we forgot about our Budget bad experience minutes prior  We went back to Budget to cancel our rental car 15 minutes later  Thanks Jack!

The food was delish!!! I had the Philly cheesesteak  which I was unable to finish after my side salad and bread  The portions are rather large and the prices are great! I actually plan to call the manager tomorrow to let them know just how impressed I was with the service and food! We will for sure be back and SOON too!,positive,5981756

Weve gone to this place numerous times and all our experiences were really bad  Our first time  we ordered Lechon Pakswi  We were given leftovers  I mean really   you can tell which pieces of meat are the fresh ones  and which ones are the darklooking  hard  leftover meats are  The second time  we ordered a takeout of their Lechon Belly  LEFTOVERS! The third time  we ordered Sinigang na Lechon and you betcha    LEFTOVERS I honestly think that on those occasions  whenever their Lechon doesnt sell  they just mix it with the new and fresh ones  I am all into recycling  but maybe when I am at the comfort of my own home  NOT on a restaurant where I literally buy and pay for service and satisfaction  We have given this place chances over and over again  since its pretty close to the house  I hope that this review would have people on the lookout for those hard and dark pieces of meat  ,negative,6188353

Tried to order online for delivery but the site was down  Ok  no problem  I called instead to place the order  They said delivery can only be arranged if you ordered online  I explained that the site wasnt working  which is why I called in the first place  and asked if they could arrange the delivery anyway  The woman on the phone was exceptionally rude  saying Lady  I just told you it wasnt possible  Annoyed  I said fine  By this point though she said she didnt have time for this and hung up on me!

Its huge and theres a lot to cover so be sure to get little bits of things and come back for seconds  I hate people who waste food Mongolian BBQ: pick your own veggies etc and the guy woks it for you right there  delish Pho: We were craving it the night before and it hit the spot the next afternoon  ask for extra soup  they tend to skim on it sometimesCrab legs: good  but sometimes salty   They dont have the warm ones Sushi: really  never eat sushi at a buffet  NEVER Carrot cake: DELLLLLLIGHTFULSo is the gelato Con: They now have selfserve registers which is ok except its very slow and not all of them are open sometimes meaning our party of 13 took about 15 min just to pay ,positive,3384585
Our best meal in Vegas! Went there for Monday morning breakfast before leaving town  We were seated right away  decor is fine  all decked out in French Bistro style  Service was friendly and professional  Corned Beef Hash was spot on  Husbands bacon was cooked as requested and very tasty  Their meat vendor deserves a raise!  Barista was on their game too  vanilla latte was frothy and perfectly flavored  Worth a visit when youre in town  well run and enjoyable ,positive,4124216
I love Five Guys! I recently moved from NY to the Charlotte area and have always been a fan   This location did not disappoint!  As a person with gluten sensitivity  Five Guys is very knowledgeable about gluten intolerances   Theyre fries are gluten free  which is always a treat   They also offer their burgers bunless or on lettuce wraps  so I never feel like I have to skimp to get a good burger   I would highly recommend this location!,positive,2378092

It is okay  Nothing really special except the different sauces and unlimited fries  But how much fries can you really eat? lol I still prefer Fatburger or InNOut over this place  But I wouldnt mind going back one day,neutral,3211405
Liquor Depot is a large chain around town  but they do have a good selection (not sure if all the different pack sizes of beer are necessary)  They can get pricey at times  but at least they give away that cheap crap the beer companies give them instead of hoarding it and using it over us customers who refuse to pay for glasses at their house    Now if only the beer companies can start making plates and cutlery  The wed have it made    Anyway  decent liquor store for cold beer ,neutral,3435139

Sayonara  teashop 168  hello gong cha! Wow! Thats all I can say  Ive always known I was missing out (speaking as a teashop 168 kind of guy) on the full bubble tea experience but this was exactly what Ive been saying a bubble tea place should be! The interior is super nice and chic and cozy with an amazing playlist  Customer service is fantastic  The first thing they did was offer us free samples  and naturally I went right for the sample  I got the oolong milk tea that tastes like a cookie with brown sugar on top  I love that you can choose sugar and ice levels and have so many options for toppings (pearls  grass jelly  coconut jelly  red bean etc!) And you dont get charged extra for half sweet (teashop 168!!!! )Overall the drinks were incredibly yummy  service was fast and very friendly and communicative  and interior was very nice and chic  Our new goto!,positive,4386987
The show was a little over an hour long   Half of that hour was watching them eat Twinkies     no REALLY    and the other half they made a HUGE mess on the stage  of which I dont even know what they were trying to do   The music sucked  oh  and we got TPd in the beginning   I dont know about you  but Im not really cool with spending $100 bucks just to get TPdReally the only reason why I watched this show was because I got to go to Madame Tussauds for free for buying the ticket   I thought 2 shows for the price of 1   so cool!      WRONG!!  Madame Tussaud  on the other hand  was excellent   You should stay as far away from this show as possible   You should skip the double feature bullshit and pay the $35 to go to JUST Madame Tussauds instead of being a cheap ass like me ,negative,5009803
i came to snow time ordered regular size take out Injeomi bingsoo on last week in the evening  I saw 3 to 4 customers who ordered first and then I asked the counter girl how long take the time do I need waiting for  She said around 20 minutes this was fine  But the actual time waiting around almost 40 minutes  Basically  the time making this dessert around 10 to 13 minutes for each   Even though  taste is not bad  The time making very slow this is fail ,negative,6589294
We were visiting from out of town for the Ironman and wanted some good food and beer   This place was close to the house so we stopped  in for lunch  David  the bartender  was very friendly and knowledgable  Great beer selection!

If you looking for a quick and tasty personal pizza this is a nice place to go  This pizza place reminds me of subway  you pick your topping and they cook it up and yum  Its not what I would consider a premier pizza place but for what it is the pizza comes out very tasty and since its totally personalized you get exactly what you like  Atmosphere is not whats its known for but hey you can order it and just take it home  UpdateBaseline location in PhoenixPlace was not to busy  no one waiting behind us  Was very rushed  and the behind the counter server was very distracted while rushing me  UpdateThe Manager named Fred followed up on the review and invited me back to the establishment and asked me to update him on the service  I do appreciate the customer service and follow up by the manager and will update my experience once I return to the location,neutral,3140273

The all you can eat hot and cold option is a great deal  Food is really good and service is usually pretty good too  My fave is the korean street tacos and the walnut shrimp  On some occasions they even have an off the menu item that they will offer at no additional charge   last time I was there it was a whole fish Thai style  The only thing that I would add is you get free sake with some of the special all you can eat dinners but often you have to ask them or they do not bring it  So just ask ,positive,4763204

Love this place!My husband and I decided to try another restaurant on Elm St  Im so glad we picked this place  The restaurant is nice  open and airy  not cluttered at all   The staff was friendly and attentive  They had their specials but we opted to try what was on their menu  The dishes we ordered were all delicious We were served with complimentary bread  olive tapenade and lemon water  The bread and tapenade was addictive  They gave us a second round of bread  For our appetizer  we ordered the grilled octopus and ratatouille  The octopus was grilled perfectly  It wasnt chewy or rubbery and good enough to cut with a fork  Our entrees were the duck confit with mushroom risotto and braised Moroccan style lamb shank  Both dishes were delicious and flavourful  We didnt have any room for dessert but well save some room for next time  We will definitely be back ,positive,3512928
I cant believe I have lived here for so long and never been before  We finally made it for brunch and it was wonderful  The building is beautiful and I loved the little dining rooms of this converted old home  Service was efficient  and incredibly friendly  This is a white table cloth restaurant but it felt very comfortable and not at all stuffy We enjoyed the filet Benedict and the lobster croissant  both of which came with salad on the side  Both entrees were delicious! Its not brunch without a mimosa so we enjoyed those as well  Despite being quite full we decided to share a dessert as well and enjoyed the lime mousse which was excellent and the perfect not too sweet finishing touch I look forward to coming back and enjoying their dinner menu and some of the special events they offer as well such as mystery dinner or jazz night ,positive,1958398

Harlows has the BEST biscuits! My eggs are ALWAYS over easy  NEVER over medium like I ordered them  I dont bother sending them back because the rest of my food will get cold  but a breakfast place should have no trouble cooking eggs properly Make sure you order your hash browns well done  Trust me! They come out a little crispy crunchy that way  otherwise theyre much softer ,neutral,1694224

The bread basket is filled with like 5 different kinds of breads and muffins  Corn muffins  cranberry muffins  normal bread  jalapeno cheese poppers!

I cannot say enough good things about Salon VIP  After a horrible experience  a coworker recommended Salon VIP  I was very hesitant but as soon as I walked in  Erica put me at ease  She took the time to explain what she was going to do and color matched me perfectly  I have NEVER enjoyed getting my hair done but Erica made it fun and relaxing  I have been back twice now and schedule a third appointment!

I have been going to nail and toe for about 6 months since my previous salon started doing a poor job of keeping appointments and were rude in general   This salon is not fancy  but they do a great job  The prices are reasonable  tips are cash only  but they really treat repeat customers well  I travel for work and sometimes have To change my appointments  Just yesterday they were booked so I couldnt reschedule  just canceled  but said if there was a cancellation would they call? Sure enough  they called and when I walked in there was standing room only for walk ins but I was seated for my appointment right away  Marlene answers the phone and she is great  relatable and American born so her English is easy to understand  A pedicure and French gel mani take about 1hr 15 minutes  I go every 2 weeks  and I think thats just right  Gel soaks off during pedicure and I dont really have time to waste above and beyond that  No complaints!!!,positive,2206599
I had a slight mishap in the month of May and Aguayo Bail Bonds was there for me  I was frightened and did not know what to do or think  I was completely panicked  I called and they helped me figure everything that I needed to know out  I may have called a few times with anxiety and sure enough I was released as said at 9pm  I do not know what I would have done  most large companies could careless about how you are  when you are out and the emotional destress jail can be for someone  They truly care and I HIGHLY recommend them to anyone and everyone!,positive,2119659

The place was busy when we got there  but there were still a few booths and decent tables left  However  you wont get a booth unless you are doing the grill  they straightforwardly refused to give us one  Ok  lets get a table then!  They took us all the way back  next to the kitchen  with servers and busboys constantly running by  constant noise of plates and glasses etc Obviously  we were quite unhappy with this arrangement and tried to get attention of a server  which proved to be a hard task! Finally  we were able to request to be seated elsewhere  Reluctantly were we sent to a table in the middle of the restaurant  Definitely better! The food we got was alright  though overpriced for what you are getting  Service was bad  getting a server to refill the water glasses  bring the bill and process the payment took awhile    quite awhile ,neutral,4968854

If youre lucky and smart enough to check yelp before signing anything with these crooks then be glad and stay away  This place is disgusting and infested with bugs and cockroaches  I finally ended up having to pay out of pocket for a pest control company which helped temporarily  Also  prepare to get screwed when you move out  They will come up with ridiculous charges to try and squeeze every last dime they can out of you  Greystar which is the company that runs the cortesian sucks in general  avoid them if at all possible ,negative,3160888

Being a self proclaimed burger aficionado  I had high expectations when coming to Burgers Priest  I ordered the double cheeseburger and fries  The fries were great  but the burger was just lacklustre  Some of the great things about the burger are: the meat is ground fresh everyday  and the patty is extremely tender and just melts in your mouth However  I found the meat to be bland and under seasoned  It could have done with a heavy sprinkling of salt  If I was asked if I would eat here again  I would say probably not  I would much rather go to Holy Chuck for their great and flavourful burgers!,negative,492225

What can I say?  The Pho tastes great and the Bahn Mi ( Item 7c on the menu) is spectacular   Ive been eating here for years and it just keeps getting more popular   If you waant to split an amazing pho ( and maybe a 7c ) with a friend  then try the XXL with extra noodles  extra meat and extra meatballs   It is a gluttonous affair if eating alone  but if you like meat and pho  you should try it at least once   Most times  I prefer pho tai ( #2) and splitting a 7c with a friend   The bubble tea is great for the summer and if you are lucky  you might be able to get the durian bubble tea with real durian   If you are going for lunch  try and go early or late  since it can get busy   But  take out is always a good option ,positive,6330321

It was cooked perfectly  the bun was amazing  the cheese  everything was perfect  BOTH times have gotten the Parmesan truffle fries  Seriously people  do not pass these fries up  They are the best  I love that everything comes with a dipping sauce  Im a huge fan of dipping!The wait staff is awesome and very informative  this place is definitely a hit  I hope it sticks around for a long time!,positive,3385767

We are new in town and yelped this gem of a restaurant  which has 4 5 stars and I can see why  We were greeted at the front door by friendly faces  Our server was Tracy and he was wonderful and attentive  The bread and Focaccia were perfectly baked  The menu was exquisite  full of items sure to please anyones taste in Italian food  We shared the escarole  cherry peppers and pancetta salad  omg  I had the Bucatini pasta and Oxtail  it was truly one of the best Ive ever had  My wife and friend had the Black Linguini with lobster and shrimp in a fra diablo sauce   excellent! Actually  everything was excellent and high highly recommend this dining establishment,positive,5947102
Was looking for a local ice cream establishment  I looked through yelp to find an establishment worthy of this indulgence  I stumbled across Novel Ice Cream  Located in a very unassuming location I was greeted by the owner and a couple workers who were all very friendly  The owner was very passionate and proud of the donut and hand crafted ice cream they make  Apparently the donut has won awards along side the ice cream  Since it was a slow night It appeared to be ok to try Most of the flavors  I ended up with chocolate stuffed inside a warmed donut cut in half  It obviously was not part of my food program however when Im Phoenix a donut stuffed with gourmet ice cream has no calories so I was ok  I strongly recommend paying this establishment a visit and trying the donut stuffed thing they make  Its pretty outstanding ,positive,5921551
If you are looking for a restaurant in Las Vegas thats menu has variety  definitely need to check it out here! Heres what I ordered!Bacon Wrapped Dates: crispy on the outside and flavorful inside! Its a must dish Sliced Sirloin Steak: Everything about this dish is amazing  Cooked medium rare  when you receive it the knife smoothly cuts into the steak  and the mushroom adds amazing flavor and texture  Diver Sea Scallop: By far the best dish! The seasoning is incredible  everything about this dish was fantastic! Smores Flatbread: last but not least the dessert! Very yummy and not to sweet!Reason why I knocked off a star  is because even though its Tapas style  I wish it can be just a little more bigger portion  just a little bit more!,positive,3122277
This place is amazing  Not only do they have quality sushi  but for the all you can eat price youre more than getting your moneys worth  My boyfriend and I just stopped in looking for just another Chinese buffet  but were already planning our next visit with friends  Plus I think its really creative that most of their maki rolls are named after car brands ,positive,5445946

I sometimes went here 3 times a week for lunch since I worked a block away   Like many places  if you want an affordable time go at lunch   Other than sushi proper  they have 4 lunch special options that are quite tasty ($9 each)   You get the signature yummy cabbage salad and miso soup with all of them 1  Sauteed shrimp  mmmm  red/orange sauce with shrimp over rice2  Crab croquette the heaviest option  a shout out to fast food crispy tastiness  its always tempting but I couldnt give in all the time because sometimes I feel too ucky afterward3  Cod a bit slimy for my liking  but still goood4  Hangar chicken or steak tasty!Again  I had an ongoing rapport with the waitstaff  they recognize you and treat you accordingly Night time is another animal   be prepared to shell out the big bucks and act really swanky!!  Go for lunch to keep yourself on the DL ,positive,1607721
In cod we trust great deep fried fish toco (but fish portion is small) Beef Cheek braised and good portion Tuna Chive in hard shell toco okay portion ( a little too drenched in sauce) We had some ribs special of the day portion not worth the price AT ALL     Sauce is a type of honey garlic (drenched in mayo ) not worth the money   I had high hopes for great food here after reading the reviews    but was over all not really that impressed ,neutral,2976
Pros:  The pizza   Definitely lives up to the hype   Although I am a huge fan of tomato sauce  I actually preferred the nonred sauce pizza (of the two pizzas I tried)   Number 10 was the winner (hold the bacon)   Entire cloves of garlic  baked until buttery (in both taste and texture)  The second best part was that they let you do different pizzas on each half   Even the specialty pies  even if they have different sauces  That helps justify the price in my mind  Con:  The number of children running around the (small) restaurant  Many were unruly   Considering this is very adult pizza  both in ingredients and price  it was pretty surprising   But  you can get carry out  so that might have to be the workaround   Not a reflection of the restaurant  just the parents who come here As other reviews said  have reservations or be prepared to wait   They did allow those waiting to order drinks  but there is no bar or anything ,positive,4263777
Love the deals that they have on hair products  Get on their email list  They send lots of coupons via email and the postal system  Every summer they have the $11 98 liter sale on conditioners and shampoos  LOVE IT!,positive,3490977

Came for dinner while vacationing in Toronto and had a great time! Wasnt expecting much for Italian in Toronto  but was pleasantly surprised by how delicious the food was  I ordered the baked penne carbonara (homemade pasta)  which was delicious  although a little too much black pepper  The spinach dip was delicious  along with the salads and everything else we had  The atmosphere is casual and cozy  and the service was great  An excellent find right on the main strip near our hotel (The Fairmont Royal York) as well as the CN tower  Would definitely recommend,positive,637420
I have been going to this barber shop for over 3 years  I am particular about my hair and the way it looks  Im prior military and have always kept it clean shaven and faded even after getting out  Have been to other places like Great Clips and the fade they gave wasnt really a fade  When I found All Stylez Barbershop and after the first cut I knew I found a place that I would be back  Jackie and John have primarily cut my hair and they are both awesome  Very friendly place and the stylists are just as friendly and personable  Would highly recommend not only for the price of the cut but for the cleanliness and personalities of All Stylez Barbershop  Keep up the good work!  See you next time     ,positive,2207456
Love this place its so much fun! Im guessing they have over 200 games to choose from   Always have weekday specials & you get the inside scoop when you sign up for their emails   The first time you  sign up for their emails youll get $10 on your next visit ! Which is pretty cool   Taco Tuesdays are delicious & fun$2 tacos chicken or beef $2 corona & corona light The tacos are actually really yummy ! Who would have thought ! I enjoy being my boys here because mom can play too & maybe if in the mood have an adult snow cone or their signature purple people eater which is layered with Stoli Ohranj  HYPNOTIQ  island pucker & cranberry juice !! Yum Remember to bring your play card to load chips on if not itll cost you an extra $2 Wednesdays are half price bowling & 1/2 price gamesEnjoy gaming fellow YELPERS,positive,3511869

This is a fairly regular lunch spot for me   They have great service and happy faces on their staff   The food is above average and some dishes are very good   Today I had a new salad   It was made with fresh  crisp  whole romaine lettuce leaves  crispy smoked bacon  tart blue cheese crumbles and blue cheese dressing   I had them add grilled chicken   It was very satisfying and was served quickly   If you are looking for a quick lunch  quality food at an affordable price I recommend giving them a try ,positive,5207071
Robert is an excellent real estate agent  He kept us updated through texts and email and even met us on the weekend to tour some houses  This was especially helpful since my roommates and I have conflicting schedules  We wanted a house that accepted dogs and had decent bedroom space and we got the house we wanted and stayed in our budget! The landowner was hesitant to have pets in the house but he worked around that  The application process was very easy since he gave us a list of what to do and things to have that will help us get approved  Truly grateful  Highly recommend ,positive,4349452
I went here for the first and last time tonight  Poor quality food and the atmosphere of a hospital cafeteria  This was hands down the worst place I have been to in a long time  We waited for forty minutes and eventually the three of us were seated at a table for two  The food came quickly which was good but it was generally flavourless  The best thing was probably the kalbi  There were a couple of dishes we nearly had to spit out like the grilled squid  You could do way better than this place!,negative,2796001

Very rude waiters/waitresses! My boyfriend and I came one evening and no one seemed to acknowledge our presence  so we went up stairs  Everyone saw us and looked at us for a minute  but no one cared to help us  So we went up to the balcony  Thats when this rude waitress started racing us to every table we tried to sit at  to place a reserved card on each one of them  When we finally found a table  she comes up to us and rudely tells us that we couldnt sit there because we didnt make reservations and that they dont do walkins ,negative,5856639
Asked waiter J    If they could make apple martini since it wasnt on their menu    He said absolutely! Well  what was made wasnt apple martini    He explained this after I had taken a sip of it   Had my boyfriend try it also   Had it returned   Ordered something else  Couldnt believe he charged us for it   He should tell patrons they dont have the right stuff to make drinks that r ordered Also  food wasnt too bad   My steak was more well done than medium rare   Have been here twice   Last two times was good  This last experience not soo great! They (waiters) need to do a better job with communicating when they r busy! Be consistent with great service n food!,neutral,365552
Third time Ive had Cool Blew come to house either for repairs and/or preseason tune ups through my home warranty company  They called ahead to let me know theyre on the way and were right on time  Very professional  technician (John) came to house for tune up and discovered a part near failure and filled up the Freon tank so were ready for the season  Ill be needing an A/c replacement in the next year or two  so Ill definitely be coming back to them for a job like that ,positive,5147942
Someone took me here for Vday since pappadeux was PACKED  I never go out on that day but wanted to do something  I tried oysters which I will never tried again at least raw  I like oysters in the can (lol)  So much better than raw  I did try the grab leg and it was decent but not for the price  My sides where unseasoned as well  The sushi looked amazing  happened to snap photos of other peoples food (was seating at sushi bar) ,neutral,4550364
This is the third or fourth time Ive been here and I am disappointed to say I am got the worst pedicure Ive ever had  Jack had no idea what he was doing & would not stop trying to upswell me  The water was cold  even though I asked several times for warmer  water  he cut one nail so short  he cut my skin  the he jammed the cuticle stick into my toes  I will stick to Jeniza or DV Nails as they are a million times better & closer to home ,negative,5354481
Time to eat ramen since I love ramen and I am craving karaage Ordered tonkotsu soy ramen and spicy ramen Tonkotsu ramensoy ($7 50): I love the texture of my white straight noodle but the broth is lacking flavor   Tonkotsu ramenspicy ($8 20): not that good either Karaage (6 pcs for $3 90): juicy but not crispy and not tasty   Too bad because it looks so crispy from the outside   The only flavor I taste is salt   super salty Friendly service   I think they have a punch card for regulars because the table next to me asks the waitress   Not sure though since they dont offer it to me and I dont think Ill be back 2 stars!!  I am spoiled by better ramen in LA County Fukumimi ramen is not yummylicious!!,negative,5670903
By the way  the manager contacted me about a week after I posted this review  Said he wanted to make it right   blah  blah  blah  I responded and he NEVER contacted me again  With that kind of service and the amount of awesome restaurants in Vegas  their business has only one place to go   in the ground ,negative,619415

Not the best strip club in the world but if you want a laid back no pressure environment when going to a stripclub I recommend this one  Went to this stripclub back in 2005 or 2006 and I had a great experience the dancers were friendly there was no pressure or bugging to get a dance it was when I was ready to dance then they obliged and thats what happened  Overall a fun experience I even got a ride home from a stripper and her sister and got one of their phone numbers  Not sure if they are still there but I know I had a good time and from the setting inside and out it still looks the same from the last time I step foot in there ,positive,3949409
The reason you cannot find much about this company is because there isnt anything remarkable about them  Plagued by inexperience and staff with arrogant attitudes  this isnt what I would call quality marketing  Upon my meeting I first spoke with Tracie Speckman  who was terribly rude and provided me with no information with my inquiry  The staff  is extremely unprofessional  Covered in tattoos  gaged ears and a no care attitude     You automatically feel uncomfortable  Head my warning and take your business elsewhere  Thank me later ,negative,4979538
Feels darn good to find a Hardees near me! They are the #1 fast food joint  ya dig?! If yinzers got COUNTRY HAM on that breakfast menu I would be there daily  It must be a southern thang  but it needs to catch on cross Merica already  During my few (soon to be many) trips here   I have been greeted by a friendly face and pleasant service  Heck  if they had a bar I would try to live here ,positive,1110052
When I first moved to Pittsburgh I crashed my bike (hard) crossing the street on the way to the BBT and I still partied through the pain and had a great time  Seriously  these are the best pierogies Ive ever had  $1 each  huge  and served with caramelized onions  I recommend potatocheese  Go for $1 beer nights (they even had this during the Stanley Cup)  Talk to the older guy that works there (possibly owns it?)  hes a sweetheart  Just be careful if youre new and on bike it might look like a painted white line in the middle of Liberty here  but its actually raised about an inch off the road ,positive,6345359
Completely disappointed    ordered to go    spinach salad  It had no spinach in it    was all bitter greens  I called to let them know and was told I was wrong and it wasnt possible because the manager made my salad  Well     it wasnt spinach   yes it was green but not spinach   They did offer to remake it but to late  So a credit was applied to my phone number  Just annoyed that they didnt believe me!,negative,761940
Yumm! The Tonkatsu broth is definitely worth trying  I recently relocated to Las Vegas from Northern California and the first craving I had to fulfill was for ramen  Monta Ramen definitely hit the spot!BE WARNED: Theyre a bit inconsistent with their soup unfortunately  The first few times were delicious  but the last two times we have gone it was wayy too salty!

Its one of Jamie Kennedys creations and so I knew that all his ingredients were local or even grown in his own farm and he specializes in bringing the best out of seasonal produce   This spot is in Corktown (the area borders the Distillery district and Leslieville) and if I didnt look it up  I really dont think I wouldve stumbled onto this casual midday spot  Its on a quiet street  surrounded by industrial vacant buildings There are sandwiches  baked goods  salads and of course Jamie Kennedys famous poutine which changes daily   Todays poutine was a braised lamb poutine which of course we order   The poutine is a healthy portion and the lamb is sweetly braised and pairs well with the french fries  curds   The gravy is very thin and seems almost like the lamb jus  I like it although my preference is always a traditional Montreal style poutine,neutral,3274434
Considering the fact that San Diego cannot support a lesbian club/bar  I was VERY impressed with this unpretentious place! We showed up on a rainy Friday night  place was a hoppin! A little bit o butch  a little bit o femme  a few trannys sprinkled in as well as some music and a great and active dance floor  I despise country music but it sure was fun watching these folks do a little two step and beyond (damn  they were good!)  They did also play a little hiphop/Top 40 to mix things up  Didnt spot any attitude here  everyone was friendly  smiling  laughing and having a good time  ourselves included!,positive,764738

Ive come to more movies here than I can remember and typically have a good experience  Tonight I tried to attend a free movie screening  Understandably  the theater filled up before I got end  My problem is that the communication was very poor  No one mentioned that the line outside was the overflow line unless a customer directly asked a staff person  Also  the staff person monitoring guests outside allowed multiple people to cut the line  Lastly  it was over 100 degrees  Why would you have guests standing outside in the heat with no water for over a half hour? Ive waited in long lines for movies before but never out in the heat  I hope this feedback is used to make changes ,negative,3037790
If the food wasnt decent I would have given this restaurant 1 star  Rosy and Flora were our waitresses and they were disrespectful and rude  We didnt get any service for the first 10 minutes we were seated  My party had to wave someone down to come get our drink orders  We finally got our drinks and my mother wanted a straw and Rosy threw the straws on our table  Unbelievable  What horrible way to treat a customer  Our food comes out and they forgot the sausage and argues instead of simply apologizing and getting it  We asked to speak to the manager and he was also rude  He didnt really seem to care to actually manage the situation and unfortunately I dont think he should have a management position without taking any type of initiative ,negative,3111988

A lot of food for the money   Pretty good  not spectacular  but I do hope that this business survives   It is in such a strange location (inside Doc Hollidays) with almost no signage outside   The inside is a big room with old booths  a concrete floor  and minimal not particularly attractive decor   We will probably eat there again (or get takeout)  but Maribel makes me appreciate the charm and food quality at Las Cazuelas  the other pretty new place located in the same shopping center   LC serves smaller portions but the food is regional Mexican (not your typical fare) of excellent quality   The people serving us at both restaurants were very nice which is one reason I hope both of them survive Bottom line:  If we want ambiance and excellent authentic food we will go to Las Cazuelas   If we want good food and a lot of leftovers  we will go to Maribels ,positive,107098
This neighborhood Vietnamese restaurant has a lot going for it  Service team is always on point and really invested In The guest experience  while amenities are humble so are the prices so value proposition is correct  Very clean facility and strong management provide a consistent and fast experience  Food highlights are the garlic chicken wings  pork chop and I really like the chilled noodles  Flavor profiles are decidedly sweet and leaning towards the American palette but that suits the neighborhood  personally I wouldnt mind a little more funk and spice but I can certainly appreciate what it is they have going on ,positive,5381063
Awww       disappointed Me and kids        3 meals  3 let downs  Figured it was going to be awesome  Place was packed I ordered the tuna melt and asking if it was a good sized sandwich   The waitress assured me that it was a GOOD SIZE  then she recommended the chips over the fries I got fries and I had to peel apart the bread to make sure there was tuna inside I ended up with a TUNA WISH sandwich         I WISH THERE WAS MORE THAN A SPOONFUL OF TUNA IN MY SANDWICH Wont be back ,negative,423289
I bought their deal from one of the coupon sites (cant remember if it is groupon or living social) to have my family picture taken last November 2012  I received my teasers a week after and the CD a month after  in December 2012  Due to the holiday schedule  I did not have any time to review and look at all the pictures until a couple of weeks  I found that there were a lot of pictures that were under the retouched folder that were not retouched  These were great pictures  only if they could retouch and clean up my son  who obviously had some tears and snot (he was 2 and a half at that time and was not enjoying the whole session)  Until now  February 2013  I have not received any response or any update on getting these retouched and I have been emailing them to no avail  I bought the package where we can get another session within the year and I am considering getting a refund for it as this whole waiting game is not worth it ,negative,1907465

Sept  3  2015: I brought my new honda fit to an auto body shop  They examined my new car and said that two of the doors are repainted  When I picked up the vehicle  I pointed out little holes on the door paint to Mario (service manager)  He told me that when they are painting it at the factory  little grains of dust get under the paint  I believed him  because Simon Dai  (sales person) told me that if my car was damaged  they would have to disclose it  I have been lied to by almost every person at this dealership ,negative,4400769

I wanted to like this guy when he came over to talk about a small upgrade to the bathroom  Install new vanity/sink  medicine cabinet and light which I had on the premises We agreed on his hourly rate and a start date  unfortunately everything after that was very disagreeable  He noshowed me 3 times  always calling at the very last minute to cancel  His wife runs the office and was very unresponsive to my growing frustration  This has dragged on for months and when we last spoke she said she would call back with a new date but never did If you value reliability and trust  keep going past this guy ,negative,2698019
The WORST service   I sat in the car for over 3 minutes at the window  Pressed the call button  Over 5 minutes for them to even acknowledge Im there  Most of my stuff is at Walmart  its just the closest place in a pinch  Thats why they have a line 6 cars at a time  all the time  Usually at least a 20 minute wait  I wish a different pharmacy with drove through would come to southern highlands   I would give them a negative star if I could ,negative,4758961

A late night stop around 11:30 and the food is still as well cooked and presented as if it were in the middle of the day  I had the two pieces of grilled chicken with Jack Daniels  broccoli  and sweet potato fries  The broccoli was crunchy to the bite and the sweet potato fries were well seasoned  The grilled chicken looked wonderful and it was pretty juicy on the inside as well  The Jack Daniels sauce tied the whole meal together and was a good size meal as well  The waitress was also friendly and quick  Good place to come if you want some late night good food ,positive,103172

We stopped here for sushi  Weve never been here before  The atmosphere is quiet and laid back  which we love  We started with waters and the hot tea  Tea was great  We ordered sushi for two and the piano roll  The presentation was great! My only complaint was the brown sauce they drizzled on all of our rolls but one  It was sweet and combined with my soy sauce/wasabi mix  lets say it didnt taste too great   Everything else was amazing though! The sushi was fresh   Nice consistency with the rice and the rolls were huge! I will definitely come back here in the future   The man running it was super nice and didnt rush us out when we were finished eating even though it was close to closing time  Try it out!,positive,6109430

Dont do it  The wait is crazy long and the food is NOT spectacular  Me and my friend saw them carried premade breakfast sandwiches around in the back (no judgement  but then dont take forever making it and getting it over to me  95% if the work is already done bro)  its clean though and if youre not up for going to Dennys 20 minutes away from campus in the morning for breakfast with friends  then this place is clean and basically does the same thing,negative,916362
Mu Shu Asian Grill has a fastfood look/feel about it as a restaurant  and it appears most of their business is togo  but the quality of the food is solid   On a recent Saturday night  my spouse and I shared orders of peking beef  pork egg foo yung and ma pao tofu   All three dishes were properly cooked and spiced and served at a piping hot temperature  along with plenty of rice  I think what I appreciated most is that none of our dishes came drowned in the typical  nasty canned sauces that most Americanized Chinese restaurants use   Rather the food here reminded me of the food youd actually get in Asia  such as from a street vendor or wholeinthewall restaurant   Prices are quite reasonable too  with entrees ranging mostly from about $8$10  The vibe of the place and the employee attitudes seemed pretty comfortable too   Overall I really like this place for casual Chinese dining   And they even throw a wedge of lemon in your icewater!,positive,3639327
Hi:I am from Canada  I have tried this place several times   I find that they do not do a very good job at a pedicure and I have stopped going there for manicures altogether  Sorry folks  Would not recommend this place at all  They are not friendly either    there must be better places to go in Scottsdale!,negative,1736868
Adopted an adorable loving Dog from this shelter  The fee was 150 00  This price was supposed to include one more rabies shot and suture removal  Tried several times to get this taken care of  Ultimately took him to my vet to get these services at additional cost  At which time i was made aware that my dog had a heart condition that the shelter failed to mention  This place was terribly unorganized and dirty ,negative,172758
Unique  amazing flavors! We love Szechuan food but have never had it like this  We had the dumplings with spicy sweet sauce and the beef noodle soup  My mouth was on fire  Both were incredible definitely coming back!,positive,5767760
Well work was done correctly  however they should divulge the cost   Especially when u tell them what to expect and what parts they should need  I needed a clients drain and angle stop and faucet hooked up on a bar faucet  pretty straight forward stuff    I told dispatch what plumber was to expect and to send out the plumber that had initially roughed in plenty blinking b4 the bar was installed so he would know what was going on  They did not send him and thusly charge me for 3 hours labor on something that should have taken 2 hours  max   He had to leave and get parts  etc   Be aware  they charge 130 an hour  even when they are the reason for the delay ,neutral,6203477

I took my 19 year old silver Persian here for her annual lion shave and groom and not only did the groomer shave too close to her skin and leave a 1/2 inch cut on her skin near her neck  she completely failed to address the issue and placed her collar back on to try to hide her mistake  My poor baby kept scratching at her neck and when I finally took her collar off  I saw what had happened  It was not the usual groomer who did the trim  it was a young girl who Im assuming had no cat experience  as I had taken her there before  but never again ,negative,2638335
Best all you can eat sushi ever! Everything was so fresh and delicious   made to order so it can take a little long   So inexpensive for great quality!

Service was deplorable   You could never find the waiter  and he was inept when you could locate him   The antipasto choices sounded good but were not  and the servings were microscopic  The main courses were tasty but by then we were too pissed off to care Too bad  it is a pretty place ,negative,4418818
This place isnt as good as it used to be  The sushi isnt very good which is disappointing  We used to come here a lot  wont be visiting anymore ,negative,5526429
Definitely not the best Mediterranean food in town  However  perfect for a quick stop or a place to sit and work  I had a short gap in between clients at work and was happy to find Zoes nearby  Free wifi  and reasonably sized portions  Again  the food isnt anything great  but they have some good things to snack on  My food came out so fast! Though I noticed others around me were waiting for a bit  To me  the service was great and I noticed that employees were genuine and sincerely sorry to other customers around me for mistakes or long waits for food  Not a bad option for a quick bite or to sit for a bit and get some work done ,positive,843775
Dr Harrison is very personable and informative  She has a great deal of experience in her field She pays attention to details and she is very reassuring  Her staff (Carol) is very responsive  professional and knowledgeable about the processes  While you are going through the processes of diagnosis and procedures everything is communicated and taken care of  Dr Harrison has a great bedside manner  I feel like my situation is very important and all my questions and concerns are answered  Very grateful for these good people  I have started a new journey with them and they are highly recommend and I am confident that I am in good hands ,positive,934727

Another update  they get upgraded to 4 stars since I have found myself virtually addicted to their vegan pizza and seasoned fries We ordered pizza for a work event and people would not get their damned cheeseeating paws off the cheeseless pizza that was ordered just for me  How good is that pizza? Well apparently SO GOOD that they kept eating that one  rather than the cheesy Greekstyle pizza they had (also no meat) ,positive,322285
The reviews were spot on accurate for this place   The owners and staff are very friendly and the flavors of the levels of spice were good  although we didnt try higher than the 3   The booths were a little old  but honestly the atmosphere and attitude of the staff made up for it and the food was excellent   Definitely will be coming back here when we are in the area ,positive,4984905
I can say for sure that David Sanders is a scam insurance agent  He sent a letter quoting 6 month pricing on my vehicle as $ 526 00 which is why I called him  During the call he asked me for my wifes name and our address and then quoted me $760 00 for 6 month term  He could not explain the upcharge  This agent is a true bait and switch specialist!,negative,1956576
Start to finish  I loved the Pineapple Grill! Dillon  our waiter was very friendly  efficient and happy to serve  My son ordered the Lamb Cheesesteak with grilled pineapple  fries and a soda  I ordered the ribeye cheesesteak with grilled pineapple  Both were served within a few minutes  were hand prepared  piping hot and absolutely delicious! I will invite my friends to this place  and definitely will be back!,positive,4576716
Not much to say about this place  I have been here twice  once a few months ago to cash in a Victorias Secret rewards card  And today I had a VS gift card and I went ahead and early voted today The voting area was set up for success  in front of Sears it was fast and efficient I do not like malls and avoid them at all costs  The only other mall I shop at is the Forum Shops because I like to go there at open and I valet my car  Town Square I frequent because of White HouseBlack Market  I like the fact that there was a ton of security in the parking lot there  I parked in a front spot  next to a Bentley  with that additional factor my car and I felt safe and secure  I doubt I am here more than a few times a year   only in the afternoons when I forgot to cash in my Forever Angel rewards  Lots of people call this place Ghettos Mall  maybe they have remodeled lately?,neutral,3935632
Wow!! So I had gone on here and done a poor review because I had called to schedule a tan from a package I had purchased a year ago  and was told my packaged expired  I was furious! But the woman  Megan  told me she would speak with her manager and call me back  It took two days but she did call back and they are honoring my package  Also  because of the trouble they put me through  they gave me a spa service to make up for it  Megan was amazing and patient and accomidating! If this company is looking to keep clients  they definitely know how!,positive,6473063
Classic HK cafe  great prices and pretty consistent quality   Gets hectic and busy during lunch  but they also serve breakfast and have afternoon specials  When its busy you can ask the waiter if you should order from their butcher section ie: bbq pork  duck  chicken on rice or noodles or should you order from the kitchen for your fried noodles or fried rice noodle soup etc ,positive,740827
We love coming here   We get sandwiches for my mother every weekend   What makes this place extra special is their star employee  Araceli   Shes very helpful  kind  always smiling and makes the best sandwiches ever!!!  We will continue coming here because of her ,positive,6066921
Great spot for breakfast and lunch!Highly recommend their Curry Chicken Crepe! Curry sauce  chicken  and veggies/cheese come together like a melody  For vegetarians  try their Very Veggie Curry Crepe! Its like the veggie equivalent for their signature Curry Chicken crepe without the chicken ,positive,1589628
For folks in the hospitality industry they are not very hospitable at this hotel  Took me 6 phone calls to make a reservation  My room wasnt cleaned until 3pm on Saturday after we left at 7am  The mgmt at the hotel is skilled at saying No rather than saying We can figure it out  They dont enforce the no smoking policy  Wouldnt stay here again  I cant imagine how they treat a normal customer as I have the highest elite status with Hilton  Guess my two free bottles of water was more than enough in their opinion ,negative,1253806
Have been a regular here for years  Just ordered 48 dollars of food to go  We asked for 2 extra ranch dressing   The bartender re ran our card for the extra dollar   Seems awfully cheap   The pizza and wings are already overpriced spoke to the owner about the charge and he couldnt care less   We come here 2 or 3 times a month and spent 50 bucks a pop  Never again   I dont understand why an owner would tell a customer tough shit  I dont care what you think  You dont like it go somewhere else ,negative,1698209
Dropped in at 11:30PM on a Friday night  Only two tables were occupied  so we were able to get a table pretty easily even though there was still a 15 minute wait We ordered the following:Chicken with skin  moist  and flavorfulsalmon  excellentfoie grais  not a fan of foie grais in general  so I didnt particularly like this dish (it was my first time trying it)pork cheek  sweet  tender  and oh so goodService is veeeerrryy sloooooow  Why?! I had no clue  The place wasnt even packed  The food  when it finally came out (one by one)  was cooked to absolute perfection which sort of made up for the incredibly long wait Make sure to order enough because each order is a 23 bite dish   We ended up going to the Jack in the Box right next door to order some more food  I dont think Ill go out of my way to try this place again  Once is enough   ,neutral,955572
this is a tough one  most of the work done was good  however    pros:price was way less than the other quotes I got They did the work in 1 day It was mostly correct They installed some components rated higher than the original quote (which is good) cons:They forgot the appointment twice They showed up late I had to constantly remind them what was being done (showing them the quote)  did not have the stuff needed and had to go get it despite me oking the work about 2 or 3 weeks in advance After 3 times telling them of the type of outlets and ratings needed they never did install the correct ones (I gave up and will replace them myself later) (Per my research) Part of the job was not done to code and I had to make it correct I would recommend them for small jobs that you do not need in a hurry ,negative,6642702
Love this place! Even in the heat of the summer  there are misters and a roof structure which keeps it manageable in the summer  Fun games like ping pong and corn hole  but they are first come first serve so make sure you see the hostess to reserve the equipment  culinary Dropout offers great appetizers and drinks as well!,positive,3515838

Went here at 745p for a sandwich  Our service was horrible  We had Kim G and she was awful  She reeked like cigarette smoke  was not friendly and was as slow as molasses in winter !!! We were in there for an hour and a half and had to go find her to ask for the check and boxes !!Will not return  Food wasnt bad  but service was awful,negative,6226242
Tried the pull pork poutine here  and it was okay  The meat tasted like one of those prepackaged pulled pork you get from the grocery store  The cheese curds were good  and the gravy was nice  The fries were oddly a little cold  with some warm spots  so that made the experience a little dull  In the inside it was dark  but it looked clean  If youre ever in canada I would take a look at another poutine shop  but if youre tired of having traditional poutine and want to try an american take on poutine with pulled pork of philly cheese steak  this place isnt bad ,neutral,5722858
One of the Best BBQs I have had  and I have had great Q in the Carolinas  Georgia  and Texas   When my dinner arrived I thought I would be taking half of it home  but I couldnt stop eating the pulled pork   So very good   And the service was outstanding ,positive,4067562
Review for the $40 holiday buffet (New Years) but was compedHorrible experience   The salad was nothing special  food was nothing special and dessert was nothing special   Service was close to non existence   They had lobster for their NY holiday buffet which was the only good thing to eat but was limited to only one per person   We asked our waiter if we could have a second one because the group of 10 next to us received seconds from their waitress but our waiter told us only limit one   Typically a bad buffet will end up with good dessert but they didnt even have real ice cream   What they had was some custard soft serve   I sure would not be coming back here again ,negative,4341064
I just received a massage from La Vida yesterday by Chris  It was my first time coming to this place & I normally go to BJ grand just because Ive been there before & I know its good  But this time I decided to try someplace new  I did not regret my decision  I got a 90 minute Swedish & it was so great  I am not sure what these other reviews are taking about with the worst customer service  from what I can tell the only reason you would get bad customer service is if you are in a pissy mood yourself & nothing will satisfy you no matter what someone does  Its a massage place  You call for an appointment go in & get your massage  How can you get attitude from that? I just dont get it because I didnt have any problems what so ever!! Give it a try!,positive,2330278
Called in the evening  and they had someone over within an hour to replace a busted water heater  Scott was really friendly  and was able to give us all the options  and was able to make recommendations based on our situation  not just based on how much money the company could charge  I will be using Pure Plumbing from here on out for my home  as well as my condo,positive,629772
Hesitant at first due to the not so great reviews  But I trusted the guy who loved the Guinness steak pie and he was NOT wrong  Ive had steaks that didnt have that much steak on them; it was loaded  Think of a chicken pot pie with steak  brown gravy  and mushrooms cooked to perfection  Its 7pm on a Tuesday night and the server said  you got the last one   It definitely goes fast  I really love IPAs  but they are hard to find in bars up here  but the Boneshaker is very good  They have a number of good beers to choose from  so you can have a variety  I really glad I found this place ,positive,1733318
Great food  great service The owner couple are really sweet and provide a great service with very welcoming environment Get ready to eat with your hands and enjoy one I the best Ethiopian food in Charlotte I really enjoy the combo plates  vegetation or meat  doesnt matter Food tastes very fresh every time I dine here  and love the constant great quality throughout the years   ,positive,1485840

I understand the reviews on the long waits but their effort is good on trying to fix it  It moves quickly as of today  Its because they are a top end carrier and like me   a lot of people are probably transferring over to Verizon  We got hooked up with sales guy Jimmy  Transferred 4 lines from Tmobile and he made the process easy and seamless  impressed on how patient jimmy was with us  This process can be worse than buying a car  In a good shopping center with good food options if u do have to wait a bit  Hopefully my phone service is as good as their instore customer service ,positive,2657268

I didnt have any of the food  sadly  because the kitchen was closed  They have a reasonable selection of craft beers and you get a tall glass at around $7$8  Not as big a selection as Bar Volo  but Bar Volo is downtown  so    lol  If you liked this place  you will like Bar Volo because it has 3 times the selection  so check that out whenever youre near Bloor and Yonge  But for those who dont frequent Bloor and Yonge area  Monks Kettle will have to do Bar man is really nice  and proactively offered to let us taste any beers before we place the order  Very close the Royal York subway station ,positive,2001831
Santana concert  HORRIBLE  HORRIBLE  HORRIBLE sound  We were seated in the first balcony  Painfully too loud   I wanted to shoot the bass player  It was way too much bottom in the mix  It hurt my ears   I could feel it in my eyeballs  Made me dizzy  Couldnt take it any longer so we left ,negative,4377560
Its quirky  its different  its tasty  I like TBAS  The buffet is the main show and offers a nice selection of curries and other items that are solid in flavor and quality ingredients    Also  the owner is very attentive  offering fresh dessert and sometimes extra items arrive at the table depending on what she happens to be working on in the kitchen   Cant recall ever leaving unsatisfied ,positive,3276217
We were there last night  It was excellent  Very casual  Huge patio  Wonderful servers   For 90 00 we had 8 drinks  seven huge appetizers and 2 huge sushi rolls   A ton of food  all great  I highly recommend happy hour  Its over at 7 pm  All the appetizers are 5 00 and many of the excellent cocktails are too   The service is very good   I have one odd small complaint   It had rained earlier    The servers had to wipe down the whole patio     the issue ? They left a dirty red bucket sitting out by the doorway with a rag hanging off the corner ,positive,6173553

One of the best cheeseburgers around  I had the American cheeseburger and oh my gosh  so good  Juicy and Messy!! The horseradish is the bomb  Great with fries  The service has been really good   I cant complain  Even though the burgers are fresh and tasty   I would have given 5 stars but I do believe they are a bit pricey to go out and grab a burger  Yes I know Gourmet  Burger  but still   ,positive,4071230
Had good experiences here in the past  but this was my last Jiffy Lube experience for sure   Dont let them upsell you!  They said I needed a new torque mount which would cost $170   I looked online and the parts were available for $25  so I said no   Before I completed this 10 minute job on my own  I took the car to Toyota to verify the torque mount actually needed replaced   Toyota could have easily said yes  but instead were honest and said I see no evidence it needs replaced   From now on I will be taking my business to anywhere other than Jiffy Lube   Cant trust them   It may be a little more expensive for the oil change  but the convenience of the experience at Toyota more than makes up the difference ,negative,1652689
Gave 3 stars because I usually love Flemings  Got my usual lemon drop no sugar and I was served something red  Told it was muddled  I have had this drink at 3 other Flemings Fresno Las Vegas and  El Segundo  It never ever looked like that  So I asked for another and was told thats how it is supposed to look  Not drinking that  Got a plain vodka and left  Didnt go back the next night as I planned Afraid of more bad bar service   First time ever at a Flemings I will stick to other locations ,neutral,1317718

We came just to get an Asian fruit cake for my daughters birthday   For an 8 cake  it was $25   That seems steep to me Dealing with Asian Asians  they are sometimes rude and not courteous   We got the typical Asian rudeness here   The place was crowded with similar rude Asians and the parking lot was crowded with rude Asian drivers and people smoking outside the store Well  we got what we came for  the cake   Just didnt feel like seeing what else the store had ,neutral,5972886

Beware  this place used to be good but I got paired up with the younger girl who looks like jasmine from Aladdin  She fucked me up  right after I felt some excruciating stinging on my brows and when I looked in the mirror there were some definite signs of trauma from the hair being plucked out  Her I am one day after with a disgusting looking mess on my eyebrows  If you go to this location make sure to get the older lady at the first chair and no one else  and if they try to pair you up w someone else WAIT FOR HER  or just leave and get them done at Walmart for $2 less  Extremely dissatisfied ,negative,563733
Been there 2 times and the new location is very nice  They have bands on the weekends with no cover which is cool You have to inquire about what specials or happy hour deals are in play in order not to overpay I paid 3 75 for a coors 12 oz bottle and 4 25 for fries on sunday when i could have Had the special 6 wings and a draft for 5 953 75 for a beer????

This Panda Express does not care about quality of food  I have ordered here a couple of times and had delivery  Recently our last two experiences have been horrible  we used Uber eats as we have in the past and left detailed instructions on supplying sauces and silverware  Each time we get our food its wrong  the food is old and when you call  you get told they will make it fresh if I come down? Thats horrible  I will never order hereUpdated review 442018So once again  we tried Panda and the same result  except this time they left two things out of my meal and 1 our of my wifes  As you can clearly see they cant even fill the boxes they label   but of course they want to invite you in? For what? For other people to see you care? You have lost valuable customers and now can refund me my money!,negative,5156762
Not worth full price unless you are a staunch Titanic history enthusiast   Get a discount at Tix4Tonight   If you are a historical/museum enthusiast  you will thoroughly enjoy it    Otherwise  for most of us its AOK 3 stars   Takes maybe 45 min at the most to get through  maybe longer if you do the selfguided audio tour which costs extra   Gift shop is a joke   A nice diversion from the typical Vegas activities but I wouldnt make a special trip to Luxor just for this unless you are a Titanic Buff   This is borderline 4 stars but youll enjoy it more if you go in with 3star expectations ,neutral,3954575

There was always a customer coming in for their haircut  I noticed they were all Whites (we were the only Asians that time) but we didnt feel out of place or anything  Johns customers are from an old and loyal list of clientele he must be that good  He showed me on his phone the people calling him to get an appointment  he has clients as far as Brampton going all the way to Scarborough just to get his service My son was welcomed by John  he enjoyed his stay and liked his new haircut very much which is a good sign  What else could I ask for?($11 dollars for kids; $16 dollars for adults),neutral,5081156
Stay away and be very careful very poor business practices here will automatically deduct money out of your account without a bill after what insurance paid without a notice of any kind and lie about them accepting my insurance on top of it  Surprise my post on  their FB page was taken down and they are not accepting any more posts Mmmmm I wonder why ????  People are finding out about their poor business practices and even worse customer service ?? too many other quick care clinics to choose from stay away from all Urgent Care Extras as they all have the same policies,negative,4579134

When my wife and decided to tie the knot last year it was a very easy decision to do it in Vegas  Weddings arent cheap and we love Vegas!We looked online at just about every chapel in Vegas and finally setted on the Vegas Wedding Chapel  Their packages were about the best for what you get  Plus it included a free limo tour of Vegas :)90% of our family werent able to come (and wouldnt have been able to come to a wedding in Colorado  either)  so we wanted a chapel that would do the internet broadcast and that worked excellently the only caveat I have with them is that you definitely get the upsell on getting the pictures  And when youre in the euphoria like we were you end up buying the whole package  Their photographer was not that great  either  and since they dont allow you to bring in your own camera thats definitely a downer Overall it was a very good experience!,positive,6358888

Came here for dinner before going out for drinks later on   From the second we walked in the hostess was no where to be found  we had to wait 5 minutes just to be seated   The menu had a good selection   we placed our order   The bread they brought out was cold the calamari was rubbery felt like I was chewing on a seafood flavored gum  I ordered the Ossobucco which was about $50  It was refrigerator COLD in the center I had to send it back to be reheated  The service was poor  staff was disorganized and the food was mediocre at best  This dump needs to be on kitchen nightmares or something of the like ,negative,652503
I love the lavosh shwarma wrap  the garlicky sauce is awesome  And  the greek salad that comes on the side is splashed with lemon instead of an oily dressing like many places  It is not expensive either  Love it!,positive,2418233
I was hesitant after reading some of the reviews but I had an excellent experience  This isnt detailing  You get what you pay for  And here I got more  Went with the interior and exterior basic package  My vehicle was wiped down inside including dash and cup holders  Windows were all spotless  Everything was vacuumed really well  All for around $20  Great value  Great customer service  I will be back ,positive,2726520
My husband and I stopped by for happy hour specials the other evening and sat at the bar  It is a cute little place with a decent beer selection and the bar tenders are sociable  We enjoyed the music and conversation and will stop by again ,positive,3770288

Absolutely fantastic experience! Our real estate agent recommended Amy Farr at Evergreen for our new home purchase  Amy and her assistant Sharlene made it such an easy enjoyable experience  They are very knowledgeable and know their stuff! From the first day until we closed Amy was easy to reach at all hours with any questions and really made the entire process simple  She was very patient with all of our questions and made sure we got a great rate with minimal fees  We were completely amazed that we were able to close on our new home in LESS THAN 30 DAYS  Amy also accompanied us to the closing to make sure everything was correct which was greatly appreciated  If you are looking for a new loan I would not hesitate to recommend Amy and Sharlene ,positive,154513
Zanibar has a reputation for bad service and boy did they live up to that standard  First off our waitress did not greet us until after us sitting at the table for about 15 mins she was rude and very short with her responses  On top of that our waitress told us that app  were 2off on fridays after 6pm and when the bill came all app were standard prices after asking the waitress why   She simply says you misunderstood me and that they would not be 2 off and just walked away  The food was ok nothing spectacular probably wont be going back here anytime soon  ,negative,6550520

sorriest Popeyes on the planet  sorriest fast food place on the planet period   im at the drive threw trying to order  someone left their headset on so you can hear everything going on in there   you can hear people arguing and cursing   when they finally ask me for my order  i ask them for the 3 peice meal and they respond back  we have no chicken so you jus gonna have to order our non chicken meals   seemed like it was a lot of unsupervised kids working  there just out of control   a damn mess   after getting attitude and the worst help  i asked to speak to a manager  surprise  i was talking to her all along   a damn shame when the ghetto takes over your store and runs it into the ground ,negative,6630360
I get my naan and eat here frequently  The lady at the counter is nice and even though the ambiance isnt the best  they make good food Ate halwa puri 23 times with my family and it was pretty decent  But the naan they make is what seperates them from other restaurants The naan they make is big and fresh  It smells so good and two naans are good for 2 peoples meals ,positive,2075131

Always my favorite thing to do in Vegas  3 drinks and 2 shots  2 fur coats and a hat all included in the $79 offer  Funny story   they remodeled this location and theres kind of a secluded area; My bf and I were sitting there and the bartender forgot we were in there   and we thought we were locked in   and I assumed we would freeze to death   finally realized we could get out and the bartender was shocked to see us walk out  such a fun Go  enjoy being cold  & order the snowman :D,positive,258041

Found out about this place on yelp  Glad me & my gf stopped by  We ordered the Las Vegas which was priced at $45 95 for 2  for the money you definitely get what you pay for  good portion sizes  tasteful dishes  We even had to take some of the food home!,positive,1269111
Jeet is a pleasant addition to the Lawrenceville neighborhood  with a wonderful atmosphere reminiscent of a Parisian cafe  And the food is fresh and tasty! Their menu offers salads  sandwiches and crepes  which are moist and light  and filled with sweet or savory choices  The salad dressings are homemade  and fantastic  The service is always friendly  and I dig that they have an exhibition kitchen  Jacob  the general manager  is kind and friendly  and if hes not too busy  he will stop by to see how everything tasted  Last I was there  he informed us they were opening for dinner  its BYOB with no corkage fee  yet  There are no wrong choices at Jeet  I cant wait to try everything!,positive,3302116
What a gem! We couldnt have been happier to have found this place   The chicken piccata was very good as was the homemade Tiramisu  The wine selection was limited however the French Cabernet was great especially for the price  Loved the ambiance and we really enjoyed the trumpet player who was excellent   We are at the bar and Kristen the bartender took great care of us  Got to meet Tommy who was wonderful  We hope to return next time we are in Phoenix ,positive,6303963

I absolutely love this location of EoS  I have been working out since December of last year  I used to go to the Durango location all the time until I decided to try out this location The parking lot is a lot more better The staff is all so nice and very helpful  But then again all location EoS staff is all nice and very friendly This location is the corporate office in town I am no gym rat but coming to this location twice a day and seeing the familiar faces with the warm smiles  makes me feel welcomed and part of another family ,positive,1818588
AMAZING!  They showed up on time  and were so pleasant and cheerful!   I left them to clean while I went to work   I came home to a beautiful sparkling clean house   It was amazing!  Really!

I have been on a mission to find a French aperitif wine  Lillet for quite some time now and each place I have tried has been unsuccessful  So while shopping at Southcentre mall I thought to myself  why not try Willow Park Wines? Well now    I didnt expect this store to be such a gem! There was at least 45 tastings going on at once  every section had its own expert staff for the product and after talking with a couple staff members I noticed that they were very knowledgeable and friendly (they even introduced themselves by name and ask for yours) This customer service was enough for me to be impressed but it didnt stop there! Willow Park not only had Lillet but also a very wide selection at really good prices  I ended up getting a lot more than what I went in for  Guess where I will be going when I need to restock my liquor shelf? Yup  Here ,positive,2219148

Pretty good Cantonese style Chinese restaurant  Right in front of a supermarket  We had an 10 course meal  So I can say I had a good cross cut of their food  I wont talk about each course but the notable ones  Their suckling pig was great and the crab and lobster were good  They also had this mayonnaise chicken fried with shrimp that was interesting  I have never seen that dish anywhere and I have been to more Chinese restaurants than most ,positive,4237076
One of the worst restaurant experiences weve had in Charlotte  We were never asked if we wanted refills on our drinks  and the entrees came out almost 15 minutes apart  Mine was getting cold so I had to eat it  and my wifes didnt arrive until I was almost done  Will not be coming back here  Very disappointing ,negative,4085958

Good place   I enjoyed the oversized Pretzel   The bar staff was friendly  personable and gave a great tour of the local beers   To be fair  Its not so much a destination visit as I found myself in Henderson on one of my Las Vegas visits and was very happy to have come across this bar   Thanks WoB!,positive,1374432

Went here this morning to get a new battery as my one was pretty much dead  They were nice and friendly  and helped me put it into my car and also took care of the old one  A couple points off though since I learned they are supposed to give a discount or giftcard for turning in the old battery but I didnt get it ,neutral,6241928
This place is absolutely horrible  the silverware and dishes are usually dirty still  and the service is just terrible  The food is a beast of its own  low quality ingredients  usually undercooked  and a small  very basic menu  The traffic this place gets is mainly all players using their free comps  and the quality of the cafe reflects that ,negative,5435129
We have become regulars at fat heads  Have yet to have a bad experience  Tonight I took the family there for dinner  We were seated quickly for a Friday afternoon and our server was there instantly  She was very polite and attentive  Our meals came pretty fast and she came back to check on us often  They changed the selection of beer that I was used to and she even went to ask if they had one similar to one of my favorites which they did! We all left stuffed and happy! Definitely returning !,positive,6033970
I was wondering why my brother and his gf were so insistent that I not buy pub food where we were having drinks and wait till after to get a doner at Ottos  I got a Chicken and Halloumi (mixed) doner  Both the chicken and Halloumi were good  I couldnt say which was better  Im glad they let me put both into one  Its yummy  Be sure to go to the washroom and press the button! What a treat (I wont spoil the surprise for you  though!),positive,2783941
The food was good  The wait was horrible 1 person waiting on 10 tables  Hostess did not care that we were waiting more concerned with personal business  The waitress was snippy when we ask for more water eve  Though our glasses were empty   Cant imagine how this place has been in business this long,negative,4882253
I really wanted to try this place after reading the yelp reviews and seeing these pictures  We ordered one of the combo plates and it was no good  The bulgogi was really tough and dry and the chicken katsu was over fried  The chicken was fried waaaay too long it turned gray inside and dark crust was falling off  It was nothing like the golden crust on these other yelp pictures  When it comes out of the fryer like that    it needed to be tossed out  The mac salad was also kind of a miss  I have had better Update   Be wary of giving a low star review   the owner will leave you a really sarcastic compliment as I can see the bad compliment they also left for another user  Good restaurants can have a bad day  My experience may just have been bad timing  Get over yourself ,negative,2563891
My advice  go really early  I went there around 1:00  expecting a lovely selection of dishes to pick from their menu  When I finally placed my order with the waitress  all the dishes I wanted to try was sold out  so I had to settle for my 3rd pick  It was between the eggs Benedict or the classic breakfast  I choose just had the classic breakfast and there is nothing special in that  My food was alright but knowing I came all the way down from Markham was a piss off ,neutral,3652532
I came in for a good gyro  and left with a great experience!

Yaaaaas Brian and Joanna for telling us to head here  I cant believe the food we had at lunch for a total of $20  $5 rolls were huge and flavorful and ohsofresh  Its a little bit of a driver  but definitely worth it  This was a perfect preflight meal and such an amazing value ,positive,6495803
I hadnt been to Chuys in a while  Every time the wait was 4560 minutes  No more  The place was weirdly empty even though the wait at Cowfish was more than an hour   We were greeted by a man who said: I have no idea what to do  Im a busboy  Food was ok but service was terrible  Apps and food came out at the same time  And too fast to be fresh  Our waiter was frantic and inattentive  He didnt bring water or napkins  He tried to clear the table while we were still eating  He was fast at bringing the check  He seemed like he just wanted us to get of there  He never offered coffee or dessert  The table next to us had to grab someone from the front to order dessert  Wont go back anytime soon  no matter how long the Cowfish wait is ,negative,2170672
Just opened  (June 2014)  this small Indian diner has simple homemade food No item costs more than $10 and is good value  On the recently expanded menu are such items as: Mulligatawny soup  bowls of meat (Lamb Chicken)  or vegetarian combinations on rice  Curry  Dosas ( Indian style crepes)   and salads  (It is amusing to see the Dominoes Pizza staff from next door  coming in to buy their food here!)Hours: 11 00am to 9 00 pm,neutral,3347002

The overall concept was nice and a good use of space  The Fry Sampler was just what our table needed; especially if you want to try a few things without gorging yourself before the main course  The Fat fries were nice and crispy  the zucchini fries taste great with ranch  and I was surprised at the flavor of the onion rings because I am not a big fan of onion rings  I ordered the veggie burger on wheat  which was a nice portion size  The homemade dijon mustard is a must for this burger   Our waitress Mary was very friendly and knowledgeable of the menu ,positive,4948766
This place is literally 300 ft  from my house so I have been here numerous times and really want to like this place  However  they are very inconsistent in their boba drinks   I only order a macha tea slush with boba  usually extra boba   I decided to give them another try today   The slush is full of chunks of ice  not blended well   The boba is way overdone    soft and mushy  no gumminess at all   These are the same issues I have encountered at Scoop and I have been here about 12 times     I would say 4 of those times I received boba that was good  the rest of the times the boba is either soft and mushy or has a super hard center that you cant even chew   Too bad ,negative,5488527

Bookmarked this place in advance  and finally had the chance to see what it was about  Lets just say this is the realest tasting vegan pizza i have ever had  I have had a lot of vegan pizza  but this takes the cake easy  I had two slices one was the Pig Roaster and the other was The Buffalo both were Fantastic  My meat eating friend ordered the Big Mac and Pig Roaster as well and LOVED IT!! On a sidenote they also serve vegan poutine and donuts  My favorite one is the Cookies n Cream out of what the ones we tried  All in all i do recommend everyone to this place  Literally they have something for everyone ,positive,580164
Living just blocks away from Aft & hearing good reviews from fellow yelpers  my friend & I decided to have an early dinner   We arrived around 5pm  and were seated promptly  and asked for our drink orders  in which my friend and I both got beers   He got the Cobblestone Stout & I the Okanagan 1516 Lager    both tasted REAL GOOD We then ordered  the platter for two  which consisted of 4 ribs pulled pork bbq brisketcoleslaw hand cut fries roast potato salad    the hand cut fries & the brisket were definitely the winners here   We even ended up ordering another bbq brisket with double the fries after    major carb overload    I couldnt move after ( the owner will remember us regarding this :P ) The service is friendly & attentive   The space is small  but the food makes up for it   We will give it a try during the week to sample other dishes  but please serve us bread this time  we just dont want to see others enjoying it  ThankYou,positive,3442264

Started with the coconut shrimp with a Thai chili pineapple sauce  excellent   Next up both the wife and I had the standard fish tacos   The fish was well cooked and flaky  not dry at all   The real star though was the mango chutney and the combo of other sauces which were piled on top   A very solid addition to the north Scottsdale food selection ,positive,4578134
I found this place off of google & I am so glad I decided to do our company dinner here! First off they gave us the private room which was very nice of them to do for us  The service was hands down amazing our waiter & staff was very attentive and professional Everything we ordered was amazing and I will include photos because Im a visual person and I feel like everyone loves using photos to reference what to order We had for appetizer their seafood plateau  crab cakes  foie gras  lobster bisque  & Louie crab salad For entrees we had the surf & turf all around and boy was their steak delicious along with the lobster stuffed crab Overall I highly recommend this restaurant it definitely did not disappoint and the quality in service & food deserves more than 5 stars!,positive,2067710
Ever since Niji got hit by a fire  Ive been looking for a new go to place for a cheap but delicious sushi fix  Despite their terrible parking lot  their food is pretty good  Not amazing  but itll help scratch the itch  Their fish is okay  they have some nice allday specials  etc  The main lure is honestly the price  Dont go expecting anything to knock your socks off  My friend who ate with me didnt like their chirashi and I wouldnt recommend trying to order stuff like Uni  Stick to basics like salmon  california rolls  tempura  and youll be fine ,neutral,997018

Weve been to this place twice since its opened  The crepes are delicious and the portions are huge  The restaurant is well decorated  with a couple small sidewalk tables for alfresco dining  You can see that the owners really care; the chocolate in the fountains is high quality  the espresso fantastic and properly prepared  Theyve definitely spent a lot of time  money  and effort on the place and it shows  If you want some combination of gelato  crepes  fruit  and  of course  melted chocolate  you cant go wrong ,positive,6186376
Nice strategic location beside Harry Rosen  3rd level Like the sharp look here  wished we had a dedicated store like this back home   In fact  the Chicago stores even nicer but I shouldnt be picky Theyve really kicked this up a notch  compared to the Nordstrom Rack where TB stuff is outdated  here  its the latest fashions Saw some sweet threads  a 3 pc suit for just $1 000 not too shabby   In Vancouver  I could get a nice suit tailored but I digress  as usual Courtney quite nice here Amex good ,neutral,3894260
I would have to say this place is hands down some of the best Thai food  It is family owned which is great and nice to support  The seating area isnt very large so it can get crowded  A large group of us from work go there and all enjoy it  I generally call ahead and they can accommodate is with no problem  Ive only ordered the vegetarian pad dishes and the curries  My favorite is the green curry  The service is very friendly and the food is great  I highly recommend this place!,positive,2869680

I cant remember the last time I laughed so hard  I was actually hoarse after seeing this show  Anthony Cools is a funny guy with great stage presence  but it really was the audience members who volunteered to be hypnotized that really made the show  Anthony Cools performs in a pretty small  intimate theater  We got our VIP tickets half off at Bills that morning  and they ended up being about $45/each The show *is* a bit raunchy so I definitely wouldnt recommend it for everyone  Go with a group of friends  have a few drinks  and be prepared to laugh your asses off ,positive,1964909
I would love to give a Starbucks a raving review because I absolutely love Starbucks  This place is a joke! I stop here about once a month because its on my way to work  And every time I drive away disappointed  In the 5 times I have been there they have screwed up 4 times  Aside from always having a slow moving long line  Two times they forgot the cream in my iced coffee  another time they gave me the complete wrong beverage  I didnt realize it was wrong until I got to work and the person I got the drink for was asking me what I got them because it was not what they asked for  And lastly I wanted to use some star rewards for some drinks and told them them 2 times and they still charged me  Idk if its poorly trained staff or if they just dont care  Whatever you do  Double check your drinks before you leave ,negative,2873062
If youre a foodie and looking for a local restaurant near the main strip  I highly highly recommend therapy Very good for a small meal or big Our server was Joanne  very very knowledgeable about the menu  ingredients and even how to eat it There isnt many servers who are very eager to thoroughly explain each dish but so far in my life  Joanne is probably the best server i have encountered  all the recommendation she made was on point! I would definitely come back to this place when I visit vegas again People say that food is terrible if the service sucks  but at therapy  they got a very high standards on the front of the house service and of course also the kitchen crew Thank you guys for an amazing experience You wont regret spending your money here!,positive,3152527
When you order online you can review your experience  I usually have a good experience & i like to review that  The last time my stuffed cheesy bread was disgusting  smaller than normal & not cooked all the way  I reviewed & never heard back  A good company usually responds to apologize  That was the 1st time ive been dissatisfied so i ordered again today  The stuffed cheesy bread again was not good  The cheese was clumpy  not melted  & just plain goop  I always order the stuffed cheesy bread & know how its supposed to look & taste  I will no longer be ordering from this location  After reading the reviews  i hope this location gets it together  They do usually deliver in a timely manner  Today was slower than normal though which is a little weird for a Monday at 11am  I guess i need read reviews more often for regular ol food chains cause some locaions apparently cant cook food the same as otger locations ,neutral,6366702

Another failed street food experience   I really love the idea of Market 707 but they have to realize that in order for them to survive they have to up the taste factor   I was sorely disappointed with my order of tostones (fried plantain) with pulled pork   The plantain was doughy and tough and the pulled pork had to much vinegar in the dressing leeching the lovely fatty taste this dish could have had   I understand that it is cheap but I could have really done better elsewhere   I did not get a lot of food for the money I spent   These is the second time that I tried another food stall at this place and I dont think I will try a third time  whether I am charmed or not ,negative,317343

I made a reservation for a large party of approximately 14 people  We arrived early so our table was not ready  Not their fault  They have a family deal that was not offered to us and we ended up paying $20 more  I brought this to the cashiers attention where she very rudely told me I needed to give her a coupon  I informed her there is no coupon as it is written on the board  then she said if I didnt tell her about it she wouldnt give it to me which was another lie because she offered the discount to other members of our party  Then family members noticed her making comments about us and pointing in our direction  The manager never came up to us to check up despite our large party  Overall dissatisfied with the employees and the cashier who looked rather vapid when telling me her name was Carla between text messages ,negative,2471946

I moved here two months ago and  I hate it I just found out kings path condos are infested with pharaoh ants thousands of them all over the building and  theres no way of getting rid of them the exterminator said he have been spraying for years and  he recommend that the residents dont spray them or it will make them more angry Ive seen them in the bathroom  bedrooms  living room  coming out of the vents where the heat and  AC come out of  the closets  cupboards  bathroom sinks  bath tub  kitchen cabinets  ceilings  even when a residents stomp from upstairs they fall from the vents just as easy  this is the worst place to live  I thought it was just me  I even thought the exterminator was lying just to tell me that  but he was right there everywhere Ive ask my neighbors they told me the same thing  This is very disgusting  wonderful neighborhood but  kings path condos 25735 Lorain road is a terrible place to live  Good luck to those who moved in with a one year lease ,negative,2480548
This is my 3rd time here and the food has been good and its a good value! Note that this is a lunch spot with out wait service  The staff has always been nice  The restaurant is clean ,positive,5270868
Walking into this place reminded me of a couple BBQ joints I have visited in St Louis and KC  Unfortunately  the food didnt quite match the fun  laid back atmosphere   Though a bit dry  I enjoyed the mild smoked flavor of the brisket   the bark was quite tasty   The ribs also had a mild smoke flavor  but were not my favorite   They required a bit of sauce to help fend off the dryness of one bone  while a couple others were too fatty to thoroughly enjoy   The portions were definitely plentiful and priced just what I would expect   I didnt leave overly comfortable around the waist line   :)Hopefully  it was just an off night as I have heard several people really enjoy this place   We will likely be back to give it another shot once it is cooler out and we can hangout in the cool picnic area they have setup ,neutral,5903448
Plenty of shade for lunch and heaters for eves  Six of us were pleased with preferences ranging from gluten free to vegan to vegetarian and omnivores  Dont hesitate to visit for a great valley experience near PHX!,positive,4219255
Shopped around for a couch  This place wasnt that much different than the major places  Same ballpark prices  Both top of the line  and crap  The staff was really cool and helpful  Nothing special as far as couches go  But they have all kinds of other furniture  Its definitely worth checking out  Pretty much the same review as the others ,neutral,4437460
This place is fairly new and right around the corner from me  I ordered the won ton soup as usual  It was excellent  (I always request extra cilantro  I no longer have to because they know now how I like it) The Hot Basil is pretty much my regular meal there  I ask for Thai hot and is usually comes just right  The cashew nut with chicken is very good as well  My wife got the pineapple fried rice  It was ok  Not my favorite fried rice  But what throws them over the top is they have Pepsi  Not Coke  Highly recommend this place as one of the best Thai in Gilbert ,positive,5466570
We went for the shakes  the shakes the shakes and when it comes to their shake it was flat   way to watery and you have to know right  why serve it? I thank you for the free popcorn always a fan favorite especially with the seasoning  Its nice to have the lounge area where you can just come and sit  I love the ease of finding the place you know the cosmo is just a nice place,neutral,6136628
Everything you would expect  We only waited 40 mins  Wouldnt wait more than an hour  even with unlimited champagne  Solid for buffet  However breakfast doesnt have crab legs   just in case you wanted some  You have to wait for dinner,neutral,1021477
All though I was skeptical of how it was going to be I gotta say I was decent unfortunately I couldnt go back for more and I was dickapointed about that because I definitely woulda gone there again ,positive,231865
Since arriving in Scottsdale in July 2013  I have been to DeFalcos many times including last night  Everything is always great  The hoagies are truly Jersey/Philly worthy  We tried chicken marsala last night  very tasty and great portion size  We also got two slices of strawberry swirl cheesecake to eat at home  very yummy  The place isnt too fancy but thats the appeal  I feel like I am back in my hometown deli in South Jersey ,positive,4452434

This magic show was the best one Ive ever seen  very funny and great magic!!! We sat in the third row center and couldnt figure out any of the tricks  how does he do it? My sons (8 & 10) absolutely loved the show  My 10 year old volunteered to help on stage  he was super excited and as an extra bonus got a magic kit as a thank you at the end  We will definetely come back to this show  its perfect family entertainment  loved every second of it!!!,positive,5376498
I called on a Sunday at about 6:15pm and a woman answered the phone in an annoyed  tone by saying Office Max  we closed at 6:00 hello? Im pretty sure thats the most rude way she couldve answered the phone  Either dont answer and let your recording with store hours handle that or act like youre interested in helping whos on the other end  I wont be going to that location  Learn some customer service skills!,negative,1916907
I was very pleased with the free water flavored with fresh citrus  They also had free champagne  fruit and cheese during check in time   The rooms were fine  I noticed no damage or smells as reported by others  They may have had a renovation since then  The pool looked nice and clean  and the workout room was easy to find  Service was really friendly  The food provided by the hotel was very good! Best hotel food Ive had!,positive,2780272

I dont like to give 1 stars but I must in order for this place to improve and others wont come here until its better  We ordered 3 slices of pizza  2 drinks and small fries  a total of $42 dollars  The pizza was extremely stale  cold to say the least and just ok  The sweet potato fries were dropping in oil  The ladies in the front not very customer service oriented  Maybe they were having a bad day       Point here  do not recommend and will not come back ,negative,2024562

Gotta say everything about this place is 5 stars the waiters servers  hosts and most important the food great aged steaks and the selection of sides is delicious not the cheapest meal youll have in Vegas but absolutely worth every penny highly recommend ,positive,1404583
We randomly stopped here because it was convenient   We didnt check the menu or any Yelp ratings and were pleasantly surprised   We both got chaat  and they both tasted authentic with the right amount of spice ,positive,6090872
This is a fantastic neighborhood market  They have a little bit of everything  The most outstanding feature at Laurel Market are the five maybe six friendly ladies that work the made to order deli   This deli serves breakfast and lunch  Their food is fabulous and consistently served with a smile  They have a wide array of deli meats home made deli salads like chicken  tuna and egg  They also have a variety of fresh made breads for sandwiches  The portions are generous!  You cant go wrong here  Be aware this is a take out establishment  There are some benches outside if you are lucky to find a seat in this popular establishment ,positive,5207662
I can only speak to the dining experience and the Fried Chicken and sides  I wasnt a fan of their coleslaw and the service was too slow the times ive been there to the point where i get so hungry I dont enjoy the dining experience most of the time  the chicken used to be the best in town and hasnt gotten worse  but there is at least one other place that is wayyy better in town ,neutral,1956260
Best Pho soup in town  Whenever Im feeling like I have a cold coming on  I order their beef pho soup because of its health benefits  Love this place  Also  their Thai iced tea is excellent ,positive,510307
Decent but nothing special enough to go back  Had their veal sammy which was good but doesnt come close to Cali Sanwiches  You get probably half the amount of veal  it has very little breading  no crispyness and they only slighty paste a small amount of sauce on the bun  I have not tried their pizza but from what I saw I doubt I will ever try it  looked very meh  So overall  if Cali Sandwich is an option go there  if not you will have a decent but average sammy at San Francesco ,neutral,824723
Came here the other night for the first time for dinner and loved it! The menu is very extensive theres something for everyone  We shared the Mediterranean Tacos as an appetizer and loved them!

This is one of my favorite lunches in a very long time! I randomly found this place on Yelp and the reviews looked interesting  Got the green tea which is tropical  refreshing and delicious  Then ordered the fried spinach salad  the cauliflower and bone marrow carne asada  The bone marrow carne asada came out first and was killer  Bone marrow perfectly cooked  I didnt eat a lot of the onion salad and skipped the bread  but the orange on top was the perfect balance of citrus  Made about 6 bites of marrow  meat  and a few onions  The cauliflower is amazing  Not sure its low carb as the topping was fried garlic  nuts and there was definitely brown sugar in it  Delicious  The spinach salad was great  Fried spinach is one of my favorite foods  I did pull out a lot of raw broccoli  which was tasty  but doesnt sit well on my tummy  Delicious  fairly priced lunch  Will definitely be back when Im in Vegas next!,positive,5302155
I am only giving two stars because their self check out scanners are the worst   It is almost never detected when one places items in the bags   This has been going on for months   I have shared my concerns several times   The clerks say it happens all day   It is frustrating   I hope they will fix this soon or I will go elsewhere ,negative,1871524
We were here for Saturday brunch  so not sure if that makes a huge difference   The food was mediocre  and we felt the choices were limited compared to others we have been too   They had a cook to order pancake station   So  after waiting several minutes for pancakes even tho only one person in front of me  my pancakes were not cooked thru   Batter came squeezing out when my fork went in   There was barely any fresh fruit or other fresh options available  Except for the meat carving station  the food seemed of cheap quality   We were very disappointed and wished we had trekked down to bellagio instead ,negative,6160073
I have been coming here every 2 weeks for 5 years and never had a bad experience  The staff is polite  fast and very consistent  Its clean and eveyone is extremely nice  I have had Tawny dye my hair twice and she always does a great job and I get many compliments on it  Usually Bianca  John or Monica cut my hair and they do an excellent job  I have never had a bad experience and I would absolutely recommend this place  If you need a color treatment  Tawny is the best but everyone is so nice and good at thier job!,positive,2192299
I dropped my car off in the morning because my tire popped I looked for the nearest shop to me and this on came up had good reviews  I did ask for a follow up call and didnt get one I was too happy but when I went to pay for my tire he didnt charge me anything because I wasnt happy  My car drives good now and I was pleased with the service they did  Thanks guys ,positive,2037156
Can I just say WOW?? OMFG why cant I find anyone as good as you in the US??I grew up in Ottawa my entire life  and frequented Toronto almost every 3 months or so  Everytime I went  I *always* made sure I ate here  and got my vegetable manchurian chowmein and paneer chili to go (my mom would KILL me if I didnt bring her any back!) Yes  ppl  its that good!After relocating to the US 3 years ago  Ive been back in Toronto about 4 times now  Most recently  just this past sunday  and wow!! The food hasnt changed one bit! Same great quality  same great taste  and the owner always gives you impeccable service  Of course  as I got my takeout dishes to take home to my Mommy  and the owner even hooked us up with a shortcut route!

As of right now you have not helped me one bit  I have two flights scheduled in May  I got married and changed my name  They said I can not change the name on my ticket  I have to go wait in a customer service line BEFORE each of my flights  Thanks  You just added tons of time in lines for my flights  Also  they said all I have to do is come to the desk w my drivers license  I have a feeling this will not be documentation enough for you and Ill prob end up missing my flight  Wish someone could help me  As I thought  Your representative was WRONG  If I would have just shown up with my drivers license I would have been turned away  I need my old AND new drivers license AND a marriage certificate  Wow  Teach your employees  Also  Im calling back again because your website says in case of marriage  Southwest DOES change the ticket  with proof faxed in  get it together  I havent even flown yet and Im stressed ,negative,355892
We were greeted by a young man behind the counter  He was not only trying to take our order he was also trying to take an order from someone going through the drive  We recieved our sandwiches   but not our smoothies  We asked where are drinks were and no one had made them :( we grabbed two waters and moved on with out lunch  The wall next to our wobbly table was dirty I wont be back,negative,6159323
Our first time here   Very friendly service  The hummus was great and the tziki (?) was excellent   I had the lamb plate  The lamb was a bit overlooked but tasty  The salad was fresh and the dressing was excellent   The only complaint I would have is the music playing too loud   I will definitely go back to try other menu items ,positive,4131635

What a fabulous addition to one of my favorite Charlotte breweries! So heres the deal: Unknown teamed up with the guy behind Seoul Food Meat Company to park his new pizza truck at the brewery permanently  Brilliant  You can even order right from the bar and theyll bring your pie to you  These arent your ordinary pizzas  You can pick your dough (original  potato  sweet potato  whole wheat) and then your country  So far  Ive tried the Thai  Lebanese  Mexican  and U K  They are all delicious  Im determined to run the gauntlet and try the entire menu  All pies are $13  Wash it down with a Feather Light (or Hospitali Tea if its in season) ,positive,6300586
We went purely for the experience and I was very disappointed  If I want to see pretty gay men dancing and lip synching I will go to a drag show  The only difference between TFDU was these guys dont wear false eyelashes and the boobs (pecs) are real  It took Forevah to get one drink and the drunk bride to be in front of us falling on her ass  far more entertaining than anyone on stage  Also I do not take kindly to seeing women be objectified in such a rude manner  Placing a woman on her knees and shoving a gstrig covered d*ck in her face is just tacky  I can see a show being sexual but with no class ,negative,6144951

Huge plus  I will definitely be back!,positive,5691083
Compliments to the chef  Everything looked so good on the menu that my husband and I couldnt decide on what to eat  We asked our server if they could provide a sample of the popcorn chicken  Unfortunately  the server came back and said it would be very difficult for them to just make a sample  We definitely understood  But next thing you know  we got our very own taste of the popcorn chicken (from the chef  or manager    I think)  They are amazing and worth ordering again!!! The food was great and service was amazing!,positive,762711
This is a nice spot for Vietnamese food  Its not the best in Pittsburgh  but it offers a good portion of pho with great flavor  The vegetables taste fresh  too  I especially like the fried shrimp spring roll  The wrapping is crisp and light  and the filling is delicious  Im not a fan of the fried pork spring roll though; the meat was dry and lacked any strong flavor  The restaurant itself is small and intimate; I like eating in because its pretty quiet and the service is attentive and nice  Ive also ordered pickup a few times without any issues  Overall  I definitely recommend giving this place a try  FYI  its cash only ,positive,5230142
While I regularly use their butcher shop  I never actually eat in the restaurant  so this was our first time eating there  The main course  New York cut and Filet Mignin were great  It was great prepared perfectly  The appetizer (mushroom soup) was not so good  but that can happen  Only reason why I gave 4 rather than 5 stars is due to the fact that the place was extremely noisy  We set inside and it was really difficult to have a conversation  If youre in for a quiet or a romantic dinner this is certainly not the place for you Another point to mention  which was key for us selecting the place  is the nocork fee and the fact that many of the tables brought their own wine  The restaurant promotes that and even  provides a decanter if requested ,positive,6378934
I recently  reluctantly decided to join a gym   I was referred to LA Fitness by my dad who is a member   I never joined a gym before thinking I just wouldnt know how to use the machines and would be overwhelmed   I was so surprised to find out the opposite once I met the team at The Tatum location! All the staff  but especially Vlad  Marcus and Nico all have showed me one on one training techniques and always greet me by name when I walk in! Even if they are busy with a client they find time to come help me and answer questions   Now when I go to the gym I have a personalized work out plan   And the gym is beautiful!,positive,2578215
So  we (2 kids  1 infant  2 adults) stayed in one bdrm for 3 nights  The room was spacious enough  clean  lots and lots of towels (and more @ pool)  washer/dryer  kitchen with fridge  microwave/oven  dishwasher etc  Right outside of hotel is a ABC Mart (closes @ 10)  pizza  Subway  bagel place  liquor store  and Mexican food restaurant   The indoor pool is a big plus!The orientation was 3hrs long   with 3 children  it was hard not to bore them  The staff here are pretty friendly (this female manager acted like she was a long time friend trying to sell us time share which was annoying)  free cookies and juice  kids managed  Wasnt something Id buy but it surprised me how many ppl are buying!!

This place is better than going to a pumpkin patch for Halloween celebration  Its simply magical  Kids can dress up and trick or treat  ( safe trick o treating)  My niece had a blast  Its a dun place  Beautifully decorated for Halloween  Different characters walk around and take photos with the kids  They offer face painting for a small fee  They have food vendors  Popcorn  cotton candy   I recommend you buy a vip pass  otherwise u will be in line for one ride 45 min to an hour ,positive,5458200
I stayed for 3 nights this august  The hotel was excellent  The rooms are wellfurnished and comfortable  The staff is knowledgeable and friendly  The food in the reastaurant is nothing to write home about but still good  The breakfast was passable for something that you didnt pay for  Just avoid the eggs in the steamer tray and go for the madetoorder line  The city bike rental kiosk is located literally right outside the hotel    like literally less than 5 meters from the front door    that is cheap transportation 24/7    very convienent  Allinall a great place to stay,positive,2604142
Holy crap!! This place is amazing! Me and the hubbie were in Vegas a couple weeks ago and we decided to dine at this restaurant  The food was delicious   the staff were amazing  Everyone were so attentive  they actually stopped at our table to talk to us  The manger and chef made their way to us as well  Our bill came out to $220 that included drinks and tips   so worth it! It was an amazing experience for both of us  We both enjoyed it!,positive,1752116
This is the second visit  first at dinner  second for breakfast   Chinese chicken salad at dinner was loaded with chicken and picture perfect   The best though were the blueberry pancakes at breakfast   Being a pancake connoisseur since I was a kid  these were the best pancakes I could remember   yes  on this day  better than Dupars at Golden Gate downtown   Pancakes with blueberry compote  lemon zest  powdered sugar  maple syrup  and vanilla bean sauceorder without the powdered sugar and dip the tip of your fork in the vanilla bean sauceheaven with every bite!  I do wish more restaurants would have a pancake option in lieu of toast and potatoes with egg and omelette dishes   Wait time at our table to order was a bit long  and the hostess desk seemed a bit disheveled on this busy Sunday morning   The server though was very attentive after ordering and throughout our meal   Open 24 hours located in front of Paris on the Las Vegas strip ,positive,5353522
I have been here a few times now and it is consistently good   We have tried many items on the menu and have all been very good   I recently had the fish tacos and while they were good  I probably wouldnt order them again   Only because I have had better fish tacos elsewhere   I love their veggie burger   It is the perfect amount of hot and has good flavor   The fries are delicious as well   They have a great beer selection and an interesting cocktail menu   Full bar for getting your usual if desired   Great outdoor seating area in the summer and the inside is very nice too ,positive,2210939
Favorite place to buy sweets! My family and I love the chocolate from here   Personally  my favorites are the rainbow wafers  chocolate covered pretzels  malleyohs  and the sweet slips   When my kids were younger we would always get them malley ohs and caramel filled chocolate Santas for their stockings and Easter eggs for their Easter baskets! The online ordering and shipping is a perfect way for me to send my college age daughter chocolate so she can get her Malleys fix while shes away from home! If youre a chocolate fan  check this place out!,positive,1108066

Difficult place to find but worth the search because of the view  The view is really nice but that is all  We ordered 4 pitchers of sangrias for the 4 of us (the sangrias were really weak)  The service is slow  We had to order the next pitcher when the waiter brought the current pitcher so that by the time we finished the sangria the next one would arrive just in time  We order some appetizers and they were nothing special  We shared a platter of dips and a charcuterie (nothing exciting to brag about)  Also  the sangrias were really expensive  You are better off going somewhere for drinks and food before coming here to enjoy the view ,neutral,883572

The food was worth what they charged  its not a dining experience  The mood is laid back  so much so that they dont let you know to seat yourself on a Tuesday night I got the Cuban sandwich which I though was tasty  my spouse ordered a salad that made no mention of dried fruit and yet it came with a lot of dried fruit which turned her off  I probably would have given it at least 3 stars if a member of the wait staff (not our specific server) didnt laugh in our faces when a little girl left a cherry stem on our table like we were supposed to take out the trash  Would have liked to leave a better review  but  I just cant ,negative,4891733

Worth making a trip for If youre interested in food and enjoy chatting with the chef  this is amazing  The chef/waiter/maitred/everything is super calm  polite  and skilled The cafe ambience is very warm  the open kitchen makes you feel very much at home  the coffee is great (theres chicory root)  and the food is superb ,positive,6450576
Within the last year 1 1/2 their bread been hard  I have mentioned it to the employees and manager  supposedly they switched over to new kinda ingredients for their bread  but it pretty much taste the same HARD       Hard enough to pull one off of your teeth out  if not all your teeth out  COME ON SUBWAY!And just to let you know different Subway locations breads are different NICE & SOFTDONT KNOW WAS GOING ON WITH THIS PARTICULAR ONE ,negative,6412790
We loved the service and the food was exceptionally good  Had the curry ramen  octopus appetizer  and butter ramen  My boyfriend started licking the plate and the manager commented  Youre really licking the plate?

The problem with naming your restaurant almost similarly to a popular institution is that you will forever be compared to the real one   Their XLBs are not bad  but they are no Din Tai Fung   That being said  if youre in the area and craving XLB  it should suffice  They serve both the pork and the pork/crab XLB  I usually stick to the original pork version   We went on a weekday so the restaurant wasnt crowded and service was attentive and friendly   Save room for dessert (Fruit Jungle is next door!) ,neutral,4975176
We saw this show during our Christmas holiday visit to Las Vegas The show is fast paced and enjoyable  especially the parts that involved the animals  My 3 year old son and 8 year old daughter were extremely excited to see the animals and were slightly disappointed from the parts without the animals  Me and my husband  liked both equally  Do no except anything extra ordinary  Just a mini version of an old fashioned circus (animal tricks  clowns  acrobats and jongleurs)  A nice midday option for the whole family,positive,6099609
I thought Id give this place a try today for lunch and was very happy with it   I ordered the Asian salad but as a wrap with the honey wheat tortilla   It was packed full of the Asian salad and was delicious   I really liked the dressing  which I chose to have tossed in the with salad prior to being rolled up in the tortilla instead of having the dressing on the side   I also ordered an Arnold Palmer and that was pretty good as well   Definitely a place to go back to again sometime ,positive,2632297
Good service and wonderful food   I loved the corn beef hash and the pancake that I ordered   My cousin got the steak omelet and she said it was good   I like the fact its family owned and I was greeted as soon as I walked in the door   I cant wait until they get there liquor license so I can actually have a mimosas   But its nice to know that they allow  you for the time being to bring your own champagne for your mimosas  ,positive,1378971

Probably best to steer clear of this agency; we had 3 livein PSWs for my elderly mother  which was the maximum replacement caregivers for the $1000 fee at the time  All liveins needed to have paperwork and completing that paperwork was not straightforward and it was neverending  as per previous reviews  I did feel that I and the one worker who wanted a work permit were taken advantage of  In the end  none of their caregivers worked out for us  no theft or  abuse or anything  but I never felt there was any real screening of employees  My advice is to find another agency ,negative,4253179
After the washer in our apartment complex failed to clean our clothes     or spin them dry for that matter  we had no choice but to go to a laundromat  So me being a yelper decided to yelp and found this place close to home  We proceeded to check the place out and loaded up the clothes  This place is really clean  and there is always an attendant there making sure that everything is going well  And cheap  75 cents a load for laundry  and 25 cents for each 8 minutes in the dryer  $3 and about an hour later we had clean dry clothes as opposed to the $4 we spent to get sopping wet not clean clothes  Definitely know where we will be doing laundry from now on!,positive,209241

Best Hawaiian food in Vegas by far!!!! The mochico chicken and fried rice is a must! The place is run by local ppl from Hawaii and not by Chinese ppl like L&L thats how you know food is done the right way   The prices are pretty reasonable considering the amount of food you get on your plate   On average $6 you get meat of your choice 2 scoops of rice (or for me i get the fried rice)  and macaroni salad   I highly recommend Ross Js to anyone from hawaii thats missing that island flavor and to everyone else willing to experience HAWAIIS VERSION OF SOUL FOOD!,positive,505672
First time dining here and the food was amazing! Did the all you can eat sushi option and I did not regret it  All of the sushi was absolutely delicious and was extremely filling  My only complaint was that it took a little while to come out but given that it was a Friday night it is to be expected  Highly recommend!,positive,1154719
A perfectly fine lunch option in an area of minimal good options  This place is actually a small jaunt through the Sun Life Financial building and a little past the actual food court  It has its own seating area which is nice to be away from the food court masses Both times Ive come the salad options were pretty lackluster in both flavour and selection (especially compared to what I remember from other other locations)  which is why Im not really excited about this place  The thing is that just getting a wrap or sandwich on its own isnt the most filling lunch  That said the wraps  pitas  and sandwiches do taste good  So yeah  its AOK by Yelp standards ,neutral,114499
I love this restaurant everything from the foods that was there to the atmosphere  Its Asian fusion cuisine and they do a marvelous job  The cocktails are amazing as well  I tried to go here as fast as I can  The last time I had Softshell crab and it was delicious  I would definitely recommend this restaurant over and over!,positive,2457596
Melt Bar is a fad food  and I wonder how long it will be trendy for   Of course its tasty   Its carbs and fat   The french fries are delicious and youre in glutton heaven for the first 15 minutes of your meal  followed by a possible tummy ache or guilt But is this worth a 2 hour 45 minute wait?  Let me put this into perspective   You could watch one of the LOTR trilogy movies in this time   The restaurants design is purposefully inefficient to make you wait and hopefully buy drinks at the bar   They make you wait to build a perception of quality and desire Unless you come at offpeak hours  do yourself a favor: buy 2 pieces of texas toast  drench them in butter  put a 1/2 pound of your favorite meats  cheeses  veggies  etc in the middle  and double fry your fries And then eat that while watching LOTR at home   :p  DIY,neutral,3608422
Been hyped up to go to Rudy after their delicious Instagram posts  Picturesque perfect burgers  tasty and juicy   but at a very steep price  If money is not a factor for you then Rudy is a great place  Their burgers are cooked to order and are beautiful  However  at $7 for a single cheese burger which is marginally tastier than a JBC from Wendys @ $2 19   will not satisfy  Wish I could give Rudy a second chance  but their small portions do not justify coming back  Burger was decent however!,neutral,479046
Get Your Move On are my go to guys for moving & storage  In fact I dont even have a plan B on my list of movers because yes  they are that good  I know if I refer a client to Derek Greene and his crew  I dont have anything to worry about  Read the reviews and you will see why Five Stars!,positive,1322169
Nestled inside Rio casino  is a dim sum restaurant  Go figure  only in Vegas  We arrived a bit early  but it was a short wait until they opened the doors  The carts were already flowing so we were hopeful  Service was slow at first  no one brought us water or tended to us besides the cart ladies  We had to flag down a server who looked less than please to serve us  After that little hitch  it was fine  They have your typical assortment   congee  chicken feet  shumai  dumplings  pork ribs   they were all pretty good  What was disappointing was they didnt have anything else ready  not even rice! We couldnt even order anything from the menu  Dont make the mistake of being hangry and going as early as we did ,neutral,3854752
Unmatched Excellence   Dont miss out on this Home away from Home Very Sincerely and Respectfully ,positive,5769281
I love that they carry CoAqua  They get a star just for that alone  Its a little expensive for coconut water  but well worth it  Its a New Zealand company that sources coconut water from Vietnam  Unfortunately  I was not particularly blown away by their coffee  I ordered a latte and I found it to be quite bitter   Another negative was that I just couldnt get myself to stay very long  I know this is gonna sound weird but it kinda smelled odd  like a machinery workshop  I dont think its their fault  Maybe its the building or area?  Originally  I stepped into a neighboring cafe and they had the same smell there except it was a little overwhelming so I came here instead  Hope its not a common occurrence   Staff was really nice ,neutral,2409799
Awesome food  menus selection and service! The menu selection may be overwhelming at first  but BOY is it good  Whole family loved it  will always be a regular ,positive,399963
Meh  very mediocre food   Nothing special at all   The rice is dried out and not fresh (this was at 1:00 pm)   The staff is unbearably rude and acts like your a burden for coming in the place   The cups and plasticware are thew lowest grade possible    I asked for a couple packets of spicy mustard; I think it was sitting around since they opened   It had the consistency of paste and tasted horrible   I will not give them a second chance  regardless of how cheap it is   You definitely get what you pay for!,negative,3603868

I have been to the Boneyard many  many times over the past couple years   I may be a bit biased because I live very close  but the Boneyard has become my go to place when I want a reasonably priced  good meal with a sports bar type environment   Food is nothing fancy  but for the prices it is great   The best part about the Boneyard are the 4 HUGE projection screen TVs and the stadium style seating that surrounds them   If you are looking for a place to catch a big sporting event  this place is it   They also have $2 draft beer of the month that will range from bud select to Blue Moon  depending on the month   Last night it was Molson select light or something   not so great Also  I never discovered this until many times of going there  but on the other side of the bar alongside the stage are pool tables  air hockey table and some arcade games (big buck hunter!)   Although the pool tables are ridiculously overpriced  that does add some allure   The air hockey table is GREAT!,positive,2229949
Amazing donuts  The drive thru is extremely convenient along with being open 24/7  I love their blueberry donuts  They have the softest and fluffiest donut holes Ive ever had!,positive,271192

Their portions are a bit small since we were planning on sharing everything family style  but other than that it was AMAZING Pad Thai: SO GOOD with the right amount of flavorTom Yum: Their broth was very flavorful with the right amount of spicy kick  Yellow Curry: You can never go wrong ordering this  Its a bit thick and has a lot of coconut milk but it was very good! Pad See Ew: Very good  We got it with fried tofu  Yum!Pineapple Fried Rice: actually comes served in a pineapple!! It was really good with raisins and cashews mixed in too  I almost didnt want to eat it  it looked so pretty  And have your meal with a Thai Ice Tea  Delicious  The staff was very attentive and very helpful when we didnt exactly know what to order  Youll see me eating here again ,positive,5062306
Sandwiches are premade and put in a microwave to warm up  Even after that my sandwich came out cold and had to go back to ask them to microwave again  The iced tea tasted like it was brew several days earlier  Overpriced ,negative,4377002
I  just like most brides were really picky with which photographer to hire because those photos are going to be forever and I wanted someone that I knew would be able to meet our standards  She captured our engagement photos and they turned out beautiful! So we hired her to do our wedding photography  She has the ability to capture moments that are so visually stunning! She has exceeded our expectations and couldnt be happier with hiring her  The second photographer she brought was also amazing! Both women were fun and so easy going! We havent seen the images of our wedding yet but we have no doubt that they will be breathtaking  Thank you ladies for capturing our day!,positive,3083466
Okay  yes  these people are very friendly  I came in here just to browse and found that they have a vast collection of games  many that I would like to purchase some day  I settled on a set of Pirate Fluxx cards  I paid with the very helpful and friendly people and gleely pranced off There were a few people there playing some card games  eating and just generally hanging out  It had a really casual atmosphere to it  though it seemed that there were no chairs around the gaming tables Id go back again to get some more games ,positive,4028475
Ive been here a couple times for their Ice Cream  The big thing I love is their Macaron flavors like Cookie Monster and etc  They also have interesting ice cream flavors that together with the Macaron you can enjoy a delicious Macaron Ice Cream Over the years  they added more products to their store to catch up with new popular items like the Light Bulb Boba  Rolled Ice Cream  and such   They even added more decorations to their store  they made their store more of an anime theme From my latest visit  I noticed they serve Rolled Ice Cream now   I ordered the Sweet Ice Cream based mixes with Fruity Pebbles  It was delicious and the texture was nice and light Since they are trying to add new things to their menu to keep with other business  it may hurt them since they have a quantity of things   I think they should focus and try to invent new things for their Ice Cream and Macaron sandwiches ,positive,2994706
If you like chocolate then this is a place to go to  I was a bit skeptical about their onion rings with chocolate ranch  but it was actually very good   and the crepes are very very good   especially the hazelnut crepe  its a fun place to go if you are a chocolate lover  ,positive,3137031

A group of friends suggested I join the  for a quick trip to Vegas to see #CherryBoomBoom    All I knew was it was a new show in Vegas and we had tickets to the media preview   I assumed it would be a burlesque show   Oh my was I wrong!!!!!Billed as a new genre RocknRoll GoGo it delivered nonstop rocking music   They told the age old story of boy meets girl  loses her and get her back   Now dont go bringing the kids to this show  its adults (18) only   There is nudity  grinding and stripper poles involved in telling the tale plus a few cirque du Soleil like acts thrown in   Madam Hoe (this might not be the characters name) told the tale with the perfect amount of sassiness and cheekiness   The booms (dancers) rocked out for 75 minutes  this aint ballet its hard core hoofing with a lot of bare breasts    Go with an open mind and enjoy the show   If youre on the conservative side this might not be the show for you ,positive,99832

This was easy enough for an international flight   I did get yelled at by the Canadian equivalent to TSA so good to know grumpiness abounds everywhere in that job   (for the record I turned my bin wrong direction) Checking through customs was pretty easy and the staff there was polite  Mostly the area where I wandered through seemed rundown  And once at the gates  it was overcrowded and there wasnt much food selection  I did appreciate that there was a vending machine where you could convert Canadian $ to various online gift cards    but I didnt use it The signage was pretty good and most of the airport personnel were fine ,positive,5623688
Their dining room is really small  We were at a booth but the table in the middle was only about a foot and half away from us  It was loud  The pizza was good  When we go back we will definitely sit outside or get it to go  The bar only seemed to have wine and beer  No cocktails  :(,neutral,5058155
Came back with more people  ordered (mostly) different stuff  and I now think its worthy of a 5 star rating  Theyre still understaffed  and this was really apparent on a Saturday at brunch  but the food  The food Frankies #1 burger was again amazing  The meat is so     meaty  Almost decadent  with how strong and beefy it is  The pickles were really good  actually  The 4cheese grilled cheese (ordered with extra brie instead of blue cheese) was buttery and delicious  The fig jam was a perfect accent  sweet and smooth I ordered the Rocky (cheesesteak) with onion rings  with no peppers  The rings were unimpeachable  The steak was tender and (again) meaty  The cheese was perfect 5/5  eagerly awaiting my return ,positive,634982
I agree with the point that there are many different offices in this complex  and each should have their own review   My cat was diagnosed with mammary cancer and my vet referred me to the oncologist here  I met with Dr  Waltman and she was extremely kind and compassionate  She did not pressure me to do anything  and was upfront about any costs  She was positive and gave me hope when I needed it most  I have nothing bad to say about the oncology department here  I would trust them if your pet needs this type of care  I cant comment on the other departments but I never got the feeling that they were trying to rip me off  Im not saying it wasnt expensive  but I expected it! They made sure I knew all of my choices ,positive,1829115
we went for breakfast  we ordered this type of eggs benedict  it was the hash house original  it came out covered completely with this red pepper sauce so that you couldnt see what was underneath  not appealing to look out  it was just an egg patty on their biscuit halves which were pretty hard with some spinach leaves and tomato slices  over mashed potatoes  you had to scrape the sauce off to see what was underneath  it was a little overwhelming  they asked if we wanted some of there homemade jam  we got a little serving size which couldnt have been more than a tsp  anyway  they need to back off on the sauce  you couldnt taste anything else ,negative,6657359
The ambiance is great the foods not bad but the service isnt great  The  ladies at the bar dont seem like they enjoy what they do and they pressure you to order and make you feel uncomfortable  If it wasnt for Shaun I wouldnt come back  This man loves his job hes so positive and he enjoys what he does  Five stars for Shaun!!!

I ordered a chicken taco today    Chicken is the only meat I eat so I cannot vouch for the other options    What can I say?  It was your basic taco   Corn tortilla  I couldnt pick up any particular flavor from the chicken   I guess I was expecting more of a smoky or maybe lime marinade   Although not a big hit with the flavor  it was moist  The taco also has guacamole  cilantro  and Caramelized onion    Personally I enjoy the stronger flavor of raw onion    The menu lists lettuce should be on the taco  but that must have been missed on my order    Nothing was great  but nothing was bad either    I was pleased to see fresh brewed iced tea  regular or tropical ,neutral,2504497

My husband and I bought the Groupon deal  We got small portions of meat and my scallops were not cooked thoroughly  I was supposed to receive two drinks but was only offered one  The house chardonnay was room temperature and tasted so gross  I feel like if this business is offering a Groupon deal for more exposure of their restaurant  they should go above and beyond and not be so cheap  The chef was great  though  There are better places to spend your money though go with those places ,negative,3757119
Pete the Plumber came to our rescue!!  TWICE!!  Our first incident was when our hot water tank just gave up and did not give us any hot water   We got it replaced with no problems and they were quite reasonable in price 2nd time with Pete the Plumber was just the wee hours of this morning   Our humidifier sprung a leak with water shooting out everywhere!!  We had a service agreement with another company who refused to come   We then called Pete the Plumber and the oncall tech  Peter  came within the hour @ 12:45 a m   We were so relieved!

With recommendations from several coworkers and friends in the area  I decided to pop into Value World on a whim to see what it was all about  Excellent news: its thrift paradise!!! Everything is beautifully organized  and there is a great selection of everything from clothes to home goods If you take your time and dig  you can find so many treasures! I found everything from a 69 cent Zelda t shirt  to brand new curtains  to a super cute cat dress  :) *Note: they do NOT have a changing room  so I recommend having a clear idea of what size(s) you are looking for TIP #1: You know the junk mail packet you regularly get in the mail  Red Plum adverts  for example?

These are some smart peeps as evidenced by them deciding to go in to the old Rachels Kitchen space! I have to say  at first I thought it was lame they were trying to copy the Rachels concept  but it really is genius  I have to say the food was pretty darn tastyful! I had the veggie burger  which I really liked  The toppings were great! Caramelized onions  red pepper spread  sprouts  and I added cheese   because its cheese fools   duh  cheese is delicious!!! Idiot  But I digress  Probably one of my favorite veggie burger Ive had  The salad that came with it was waaay underdressed but pretty good  I will say the cookies  however  are terrible  TERRIBLE I say! They had the funky smell/taste of food in your fridge that has a banana and onions in it and no baking soda to soak up the stanky odor   probably because they have been sitting in the bakery case forever  Blech yucky no yum yums! Other than my icky cookies everything was great ,neutral,5088702
This place is now my go to nail shop  The atmosphere is relaxing  the customer service is amazing  and the quality of service is great  Its a little on the pricey side  but with them serving fresh tea and wine it makes up for it  They go the extra mile here  They do have a wide variety of colors  They offer SNS  Very clean and neat place  I definitely recommend  Also they do accept walk ins but its best to set an appointment they get busy ,positive,5493812
We have loved this place for awhile now  But this time we went the customer service was horrible  We have a taco plate that was supposed to come with guacamole on it  it has a time tiny bit so my husband went and asked for more because it didnt have a lot  The girl kept saying it came with it  and my husband was saying it didnt come with hardly any  the cook then said he wanted to see my husbands plate  because they didnt believe him  So rude! If a customer wants more they should be able to get some without having to show the cook their plate  Very disappointed this time around ,neutral,6047317

I dont think an example is needed to preface feedback for one of your employees genuine and helpful cheery attitude   She exemplified a wonderful person capable of serving at her best   She loves to serve people and make their day bright   I enjoyed a wonderful interaction with her while she was on a slow night shift  Her capacity to interact with me and make me feel at home was a priceless level of service for a customer only ordering coffee   I would guarantee she would be of equally great service with more responsibility which means the need for more customers to serve   Dennys help make your employees successful and drive some sales ,positive,2029390
This place is amazing  Being from Southern California is not easy to be impressed by good Mexican food  This place rocks!

Ridiculously OVERPRICED!  Weve dined at Daniels NYC  Gary Danko  French Laundry and more   Guy Savoy provides fine food  fine atmosphere and great/friendly service but their prices are so exorbitant it is hard to enjoy the experience   It would practically be cheaper to fly from California to NYC and enjoy a perfect meal at Daniel  And considering we were there at 9pm on a busy Las Vegas Thursday night and the place was practically empty  it seems that others are catching on   We wont be back ,negative,4345315

I stopped in Cabo fish taco for the second time ever and was again really impressed by the food  Cabo has a very unassuming environment  This place is casual  with a nice outdoor seating area  open via a garage door  The menu is full of margaritas  burritos  tacos  and drink specials  They have regular specials on Tecate and PBR  as well as food specials As far as the food goes  the standard salsa they bring is a corn and tomato based salsa that I really enjoyed  Unfortunately  the chips were slightly stale  but the salsa itself was solid  I ordered the grilled shrimp tacos and loved them  They have a nice aioli and the tortilla is buttery  Given this places spot on triple d  I was worried about commercialism the first time I visited  but Ive been overall impressed by the food both times  Not a bad spot for casual drinks and good food ,positive,2612588

Amazing burgers! Love the create your own and getting goat cheese on the burger  The one downfall is that the egg is over hard  which I wouldnt order as I prefer over medium to have the runny yolk  Other than that one tiny pick  its amazing! The burger is too much for me to have a side of fries to myself so its a good idea to share  The service here is great!We ate in silence the entire time unless we were mumbling about how good it is  and keeping me silent is hard to do!,positive,268293
Showed up about 4:30pm on Saturday after getting off work   they close at 5pm  Was made very clear that I was going  to put $145 towards a pair of boots they didnt even have in stock (and wait 710 days for delivery   are they coming from Russia?) or they just were not going to deal with me  Then I get the explanation of custom orthos and how it can take weeks to get accustomed to them   sorry  but the idea that pain equals solution and healing is archaic and lame  Ill spend my money somewhere that my comfort comes before their profit   you made it all about your profit  that came across very clear   now you have hundreds less ,negative,4441046
We stayed here for 4 nights and it was a beautiful Deluxe Suite  It made me wish I could have a studio like that in Chicago! The water bottles were free of charge  but you would have to call room service for extra as well as kitchenware and robes  This hotel was very clean and the staff members were so friendly  They all went out of their way to make you happy  Also beware  the market place is expensive  Tasty  but costly  My selfserve coffee cost as much as Starbucks Oh yeah    their beds are very comfortable!,positive,6104785
Big drop off the star ladder  The double chicken avocado salad was my choice  but after arriving home  almost half of the chicken was ineligible to be eaten  It was either rubbery or fatty and chewy  The other half of the chicken was good  but some soggy lettuce doomed most of the salad  even though the dressing was served on the side  At about 7 bucks  this wasnt a great deal or meal  Watch your chicken people UPDATE: Customer service and manager responded to my online complaints in a timely fashion  They were both nice and gave me coupon codes for free food ,negative,566241

The service department is unbelievable  I called them at 12:30 to let them know that I wanted to bring my Rhino in and drop it off for repair because it would not come out of reverse  They informed me that they probably wouldnt be able to look at it until early next week  That was completely acceptable to me  I stopped in about an hour later  As I was unloading it the service guy came out to greet me  I told him the problem I was  having and he offered to take a look at it on the spot  He knew within minutes what the problem was and fixed it  I left 10 minutes later  Thanks guys  I wont be going anywhere else  Appreciate it ,positive,4995472
Really hoping management reaches out to me because I really loved this place until Thursday night when I came to order food  drink and gamble a little but instead I left without doing any of that after I watched the bartender light up a cigarette right in front of me   Ok Ive seen that before so maybe I can let it slide   Then I see the waitress light up and now Im gettin a little irritated and then as Im looking at the food menu  THE COOK comes out into the bar area and lights up a damn cigarette! This is completely unacceptable in my eyes and Im not sure if Ill be coming back  Shame as the food is very good,negative,4312270
The sign on the door so it opens at five  two employees inside saw me waiting outside; at 5:04 the guy unlocked the door  With a look of disgust  he took my order  The young lady set down my drink and would not make eye contact and said; heres your coffee  I must be going deaf because at no time did I hear a thank you from either one of them I went over to the condiment bar  and observed the trash still mostly full from the night before   Theres a nice looking bakery almost nextdoor  Next time I think I will go there ,negative,5010687

Plus  if you come in at a certain time  you can get appetizers for halfprice   A couple of chicken quesadillas  an order of guacamole  and 2 margaritas each  and we are out of there for under $19  you cant beat that!!!  Plus really delicious chips and salsa  including a bean dip  that is pretty tasty!!Ole!!,positive,6071582
The folks here are so nice  Wow! The food was very good  A very nice experience  Well priced too ,positive,4837274
Love this place  always my first choice for Mexican food  This location is my favorite of all the Manuels restaurants in the valley  Chris and the other staff in the cantina are great  we always make it a point to sit in the cantina ,positive,3525037
This review is regarding drinks only at The Craft I absolutely loved the huge selection of craft beer here  120 of them on tap! There is a nice  chill patio facing a relatively quiet street in Liberty village  The prices for drinks here are really good  considering you can order a set of 4 tasters at 5 oz each for $11  and there is no limitations on what you can select!Would definitely come back here again for drinks ,positive,5591011
Really chill spot  customer service was great  but I had a problem with how small their boba was! Not the best that Ive tasted but not worst either  Typical boba spot in my opinion  Bought the taro milk tea ,negative,4294776
My children (ranging from 18) have been patients of Dr  Bashara for a year and a half and this is where they will continue to go until they no longer can go to a pediatric dentist :) I am always impressed with Dr  Bashara and staff from the phone conversations to the in office visits  The waiting area is clean and fun for the kids  they have puzzles  a train track suspended from the ceiling  a few video games  TV screens playing movies  etc  The xrays and patient areas are clean  well kept and comfortable  The staff is genuinely happy to see you and has always treated us with the utmost respect and friendliness  This office is farther from my home than my previous dentist but I am more than willing to travel in order to offer my children this type of care! Thank you Sweet Tooth Pediatric Dentistry! My children love going to the dentist because you make it enjoyable and informational!,positive,3671038
Very back logged orders  We placed over 100 items and on a 1/3 came  They ended us giving dessert and all other item were disregarded I wont remember this place as they are very poor service using dinner   This is a Tuesday for dinner   Would recommend to come during Lunch less busy and price is cheaper,negative,5799471
Visited for the first time last night and for a Saturday night the place was a madhouse  Still  the bartenders kept their cool  were fast on the drinks  and kept a smile on their faces throughout all the crazy Didnt eat at Blackfinn last night  but their menu looked good so we stopped in just before noon today for lunch  Also wanted to see the restaurant when it wasnt packed wall to wall  Service was really prompt and solid  which almost always is the challenge new restaurants face  The wait staff seemed very well trained and I was impressed Fish and chips were delicious  My husband loved his French dip style sandwich  I like this location much better than the uptown location  Well be back!,positive,5870886
During a conversation with a very irrate owner (Brian)  I was informed that my net was in and would be installed the following day  When it arrived it was yet again the wrong size  The installer stated he was going to call Brian to get further instructions   He returned to us saying that they would have to contact me at a later date because they didnt have the right size  This was several weeks ago and I have yet to hear from anyone  Calling the office I receive the same old  I will send the manager a message ,negative,961304
They always open late on weekends  I have had to wait upwards of 15 minutes past opening time on multiple occasions  which makes me believe its a less than professional business  The items for sale are not very current  and are not necessarily seasonal  I wont go theyre again after having to wait  for them to open again this Sunday ,negative,5105318
My son loves the tea here  We spent a few hours visiting today  Relaxing atmosphere  great drinks and the pumpkin roll was very good ,positive,3815052
It was just before 10pm  they are still open  Went up to the hosts stand to get a table  The girl said sorry were closed  I asked what time do you close?  she said 10  I said well it is 10 to 10 so you are still opened  She said sorry the kitchen is closing and by time you order will be too late  Wow for a new business trying to make it not very professional  They should be happy to get what ever business comes in  Wont be back!! Impression starts at the front door!,negative,3230112
Great movies  yummy pretzels  Plus  you are supporting a small  independent theater which should be important to you if you consider yourself a lover of films!,positive,1519131
Incredibly rude and pretentious bouncer at the entrance/elevator  I do not normally leave reviews but this is an exception  I am a tourist to Charlotte and was treated very inferior because my brother had on (very nice) sneakers and shorts (its warm this weekend!!)  I was not aware Charlotte was so serious about attire to enter hotel bars    ,negative,3190981
I see all the poor reviews  and I dont think regular Walmart problems should specifically affect the score for this particular location   This store is always stocked  a real effort is made to keep it tidy and although the staff is not too eager they are trained and can handle even the most difficult flying price marchers  and item forgetters  Really one of the better Walmarts Ive seen ,positive,2589898
this place is soooo dam good!!!!    but quesdillas and burritos are on the small side :( witch is really sad     and is one of the reasons why i will not give it five if they gave bigger portions theyd be perfect,positive,6646873
I love Astoria! Its definitely a go to of mine when visiting the Danforth and the fact that they brought a few locations north is awesome!Every experience Ive had there has been great  friendly and quick service I usually order the chicken souvlaki dinner or a chicken greek salad  Cant go wrong  They have the best tzitziki though!! Its so garlicky and strong unlike others!! I love it! Just dont make plans to kiss anyone afterwards hahaWill definitely return  maybe Ill check out the Vaughan location!,positive,2373530
Jang Won is my goto restaurant for All You Can Eat KBBQ  You can get AYCE pork belly (or SamGyupSal) for the mere price of 15 dollars!The quality of the meat is decent  but not spectacular  But hey  remember: 15 dollars! What I like most about this place is the quality of their service  Whenever you ask for more meat or veggies  they give it to you posthaste  They respond quickly once you call for them  and they even throw in free bottles of beer or a bottle of Soju if your party exceeds three people Id definitely recommend this place  especially if youre on a students budget (which I unfortunately am :( )  Ill definitely be back again in the near future ,positive,3298215
Yes were here the day after St Patricks Day its so nice in here  team Hennessey you guys rock after the mad rush of party people from last night working all the long  hours you all are kicking butt today the drinks are awesome the service from everyone is wonderful  Dont worry about any bad reviews you guys have because we were here last night and were her now the service was great then and now thank you for the great food and drinks your awesome,positive,6505801
Has one of the best tasting chicken sandwichesas long as you get the original chicken sandwich   The chargrilled sandwich is just okayalthough more healthy  its nothing compared to the fried goodness of its counterpart   Waffle fries are delicious  lemonade is actual lemonade    just lemons and sugar   They are very family friendly with snacks for the kids while you wait  free diapers in the bathroom  and ice cream with the kids meal   Fruit is always nice instead of fries  but the fruit  unfortunately is not the freshest The staff is always polite and courteous   I always have to do a doubletake when I hear  my pleasure when thanking them   You dont hear the too often from other fastfood restaurants   Although I may not agree with some of the corporates stances on social issues  I never hesitate to take my kids there because I know its one of the few place I can take my kids out to eat   They love it ,neutral,1695510
NOT TO BE MISSED!!!We visited here a few months ago with our girls (3 and 7 y/o) who had a blast   The girls just had a blast  and it was easy on the parents too   THere is no admission fee   The prices for the rides are $2$3 per person (parents pay too) which I thought was a little expensive  but the rides are long and enjoyable   Definitely worth the price after the fact   The food in the snack shop is good and very reasonably priced   The experience was just so enjoyable for kids and parents ,positive,3845036
This store has the WORST customer service  They cant answer questions and theyre always annoyed if you ask for assistance ,negative,5602198
Stayed here for Gilleys still expected to pay cover for poor service in the hotel specifically chosen for my mothers birthday  My opinion  fuck this place,negative,4584116
I was so excited to try it because people rave  NOT a fan  I guess if you like super sweet sauce it will be up your alley  I couldnt eat it  I will stick to Joes pizza or Slice of Sicily  pay much less and enjoy much more ,negative,2764408
love the chicken combo here  excellent price for students on campus and good taste  The owner was nice  Highly recommended,positive,6608412
Amazing !  So many butterflies  Fun to taking so many photos!  Few butterflies landed on me  Awesome moments!,positive,263023
Love the atmosphere in this place and the beer selection but the food sucks   I had the jerk chicken roti and it was the blandest thing Ive ever eaten   Tasted like some hippy food youd buy out of a van at a Dead show   Two or three pieces of chicken and a bunch of mushy vegatables   No rice  no cheese  no sour cream   Boring ,negative,3488626
I cant speak to the whole menu  but I will often judge a restaurant by whether or not I find a dish that I crave and just simply have to buy every so often  For me  that dish exists here  It is the Sundevil Chicken  I have literally been buying it periodically for over 10 years and still love it  I highly encourage you check it out!,positive,1969358
Food filling but too damn salty  Cook must think everyone likes salt like he does   I wont be back ,negative,1198393
After going to Ashely  RC WILLEY  Walker  And several other furniture stores I am so happy I came to living spaces  The sales associates are so incredibly helpful and understanding with what youre looking for  Almost all of their couches are customizable to any fabric or color you want and you can even customize the size and style of couches  We purchased our dining room table which was also customized to what we were looking for along with our sectional couch which both look absolutely amazing  I would and have been recommending this furniture store to all my friends and family  Their furniture is high quality and the warranty you can purchase is amazing as well  Please dont compare them to these other furniture stores  they go above and beyond to find what youre looking for ,positive,189526

1 star off for dirty room  bed was full of hair! Yuck  We had to change rooms  Even our 2nd room had lots of hair on the floor and towels in the washroom  As we arrived around midnight  we were too tired to call and ask clean towels (luckily I always travel with my own towel and pillow!)1 star off for breakfast at the Concierge Lounge  One of the smallest selections  even Residence Inn hotel have bigger selection  They had scrambled eggs that I didnt like (really hard and strange)  sausage (that I dont eat) and white bagels (no whole grain)  No potatoes or veggies  I chose berries and strange porridge that tasted like some grains  not sure if it was even oatmeal Other than that the room was nice  great location and friendly staff  Right next to the famous mall ,neutral,28681
This was a pleasant surprise  Parking is no doubt a challenge  I was in town visiting and found this place near by  We were visiting about 830 pm and I had to drive a around a bit to find a parking spot  The food was very good  We ordered two of this dish that was 5 tons of food each! we only needed one  I dont know what it was called but it has everything on it  You can order one of these and it is plenty of food for min of 4 people  So we had plenty of food left over  The beverages were good the service was excellent  I recommend  I could not tell if there was any eye candy the place is set up kind of weird but Im sure it is because the building layout ,positive,5618027
I heard good things about this place and I went and order Deerioca Matcha and when I paid the girl told me it will take 15min (I have been warned by my friend just yesterday that she waited 20min without no one else waiting)  I was ok with 15min since I had go to grocery shopping anyways  When i came back 15min later  the girl told me it is coming and I had to wait an extra 15min  no kidding! Why does it take THIS long for a match milk tea with pearl?? I can go to Chattime which is in the same plaza and they can have one done in less than 5min!!! and I finally got my drink and they were sorry for the wait  but at least offer a free drink on them for next time or something for ppl that waited 30min for a drink!!!,negative,2304056
My girlfriend and her friend came to this place first  Then she brought me here  I brought also my friends with me to try this place  We came for lunch  And its quite nice place  Good ambiance with nice service  For lunch  you dont have lot of choice for sushi  But enough for your appetites  Good thing is you can bring your own vin  A bottle of sake would be nice ,positive,3745341
Im a vegetarian and love finding a restaurant with veggie options  I only had a few drinks when I popped in yesterday  but I will def be back to try the vegetarian nachos sometime  Our server Ari was fun and knowledgeable about the menu  Nice to see someone who actually likes being at work!,positive,2905803
Amazing bakery! I ordered a cake for my sister in laws gender reveal party! I spoke with Sue  who Im guessing is the owner  and placed my entire order over text messages! I dropped off an envelope with the babys sex written inside a few days before the party  and picked it up the day of! Absolutely beautiful  exactly what I asked for and more! Topped with gorgeous gold glitter  and we soon found out the inside with dyed blue for a baby boy! Could not have asked for a better experience with Beckers Bakery  and will definitely be going back!,positive,267064
Great store!  The customer service was great   I walked in and she noticed my MK watch and asked me which store I got it at and showed me some other watches and bracelets   I was actually coming in here to look for the MK Suede perfume but they were out and she said it was limited edition   So I ended up leaving with the other watch I wanted and a cute bracelet   I like that Michael Kors has a lot of cute bags  watches and bracelets  and is affordable as far as designer brands go   I also dont like bags with logos like Gucci  Coach  LV  etc   So MK works out great for me majority of the time  and you wont be dropping $1700 for a bag ,positive,1595672
Now after a few years I am not getting the same thing every time I go in  They have a huge menu and everything new I have tried I have found delicious  and huge portions  It has to be one of the most efficient restaurants anywhere ,positive,3965066

The pho here absolutely lacks flavor  Dont know what others standards are to say this is the best in arrowhead but their broth tastes like it had maybe one animal bone to cook for one hour it tastes like nothing  The higher prices because this is at arrowhead  about 2 times as much on average expect to pay around $13 for a bowl of pho The best part of my meal was the spring roll  the pho dac biet was very lacking in all aspects besides size  Will not be coming again because why would I when I can go to a nearby spot for half the cost along with quality?,negative,4958233
Cant get enough of the Special Italian sub sandwich   Its huge and stuffed with meat   I drive all the way from South Phoenix to eat here   Definitely worth it ,positive,702259
We would give it 10 stars if we could !!The best BBQ and ice cream we have ever had !!!We are from CT and will make this an every visit stop  A must go to place to eat !!!Awesome !!!!,positive,6178341
My to go order included ribs with baked beans and mac and cheese   The ribs were meaty but lacked succulence  One of the slabs was darker (burnt) than it should have been   The baked beans were right up my alley   The kind of mac and cheese served is made with velveeta; not my cup of tea   To their credit  I can proudly say the peach cobbler was some of the best I have ever had!  It was scrumptious   I ordered a large so that we could share  but the portion was really only enough for one person  to my dismay   Yum   Now  I know where to go when I want something sweet ,neutral,3818392
I enjoyed my crab burger and would recommend that  Be prepared to pay extra for any toppings aside from lettuce  tomato and onion  That includes cheese  French fries are also sold separately  The interior of the restaurant looks nice and is comfortable  Service was fine  we didnt have any issues ,neutral,2044572
BAD BAD BAD!!! STAY AWAY!!! I live next to this joke of a place  Dirty  gross  and rude  We spent $55 and ate 2 of the 6 items that were ordered  The sweet bread was first served to us raw inside  the Vietnamese spring rolls were gummy  the braised beef tendon tasted old and rotten  I wish I had a picture of the rainbow roll they tried to serve me: the cuts of fish were visibly mascerated and bloody  very poorly cleaned ,negative,424223
I will preface by saying I am a very patient person and always give the benefit of the doubt  However honesty is the best policy NEVER promise something you can not execute  This is now the third time between two locations (also 44th and Thomas) that I have called ahead and promised they could get me in for alignment  Three hours later they finally pulled my car in for an estimated 2 hour alignment  Never acknowledged by manager after I finally said something to two reps after waiting for TWO hours  This place is a complete joke dont waste your time or money here ,negative,2843024
I am always disappointed with the beer selection in Canada  come on people get with the program ! From the looks of this place it should have been awesome  its billed as an Irish pub type of bar the atmosphere was great lots of TVs a loud pregame crowd but the food was just unimpressive  I had a Ruben  which should have been a very safe bet in an Irish  pub but it wasnt good at all! American cheese  What??? The waitress was rude when I was paying with my CC she noticed I didnt have a chip in my card and I was having some issue with the machine they bring to the table so you can pay and she said Your American it doesnt like you well then thanks lady   smh,negative,1851682
Stopped in here with my family for a beer and some food and was really glad I did  Its hard to find a place that really knows its beer but is also kid friendly  I enjoyed a great craft beer while the kids played shuffle board and board games  they have a whole bookshelf of them  Everyone found something to eat on the menu and based on there not being a crumb left  my kids really liked the pizza  I went for the Thai Chicken flatbread but at the last minute asked if they could turn it into a wrap for me as I hadnt eaten veggies in awhile  They were super accommodating and it tasted delicious  the chicken was obviously fresh and cooked in house  I will definitely be back!,positive,4616563
The wait service was great we got there early around 5 and they tried to sit us in a small table  When we asked to be hostess seemed a little annoyed  They changed the Caesar salad to a smaller portion less chicken and they dont cut the chicken  They charged 11 dollars for an extra piece  The wedge was great and the blue cheese waa more like sour cream   The stuffed mushrooms are a must!,negative,5040573
The regular pizza is good but Messinas Sicilian Pizza is where its at   They have the best Sicilian around   hands down   Their sandwiches are very  very good   Their wings only come in two flavors  mild and BBQ but the price is great for the large order you get ,positive,4980170
Always delicious   The other night I had their mountain vegetables soup with tofu noodles   It was delicious   Also had Nasumiso appetizer: eggplant and peppers with a sweetish miso sauce   Really really good ,positive,250132

Tiffany does such a thorough massage  that it has actually helped my mental health just as much as its helped my physical being  She uses essential oils and its very therapeutic  She puts on soundscape music that creates an ambiance that will put you in a good mood  She has heated stones which is my FAVORITE  Highly recommended  Ask her about it! She is one of the most thoughtful and caring people I have ever met  Her fingers work magic  She is a healing goddess  You wont regret choosing Tiffany ,positive,5669456
went back and had a much better experience with other staff and waiterstried other flavors and were as goodwill come back  crossing fingers for consistency in the (good) servicegood the owner checks reviews so he can act as and if needed to improve customers experience,positive,6658670
I have been going to Saga since I first moved to Pittsburgh  almost four years ago now  Their sushi is amazing & their bartenders are great at mixing drinks  It can get loud and crazy in here because of the hibachi but none the less it is a great restaurant with a great overall experience  If you are ever in the Robinson area  check out their sushi line up & their wine list ,positive,2205488
Super bad  I ordered a pita salad and the lettuce that he put into the salad was clearly wilted and going bad  It was pretty much bright orange in color  The chicken was completely uncooked and rubbery  I had to stop eating to avoid getting sick  Also I was the only customer so Im thinking the employee didnt really know how to cook   at all  Wish I could get my money back ,negative,4643058
Good food great people  Go there a few times a week for breakfast  Food is always good and fresh  The service is great which is hard to find in Phoenix ,positive,1356036
This place is a bit outta the way  but Im always on the prowl for great crispy wings  with awesome house sauces  and creamy house blue cheese to dip them in   A few people had told me to try DDs for the wings and maybe my expectations were too high   The wings were average at best   The place seems more interested in being a local dive drinking bar than a culinary gem focused on turning out exceptional wings   My search continues!Any yelpers that have the low down on really good wings  please let me know ,neutral,5422972
I went to resturant to get take out  When i ordered dal makhani and chicken tikka  they said 2530 mins wait as they make everything fresh  I thought that lets wait maybe its worth the wait  But was completely wrong  Chicken tikka was like sweet and did not taste good  Before going to pick up the food i called in after 20 mins if food is ready and the person said bluntly that you ordered 5 mins back  Wrong  i ordered long time back  So in all not good experience 2 stars because the dal makhani tasted good ,negative,2827374
Absolutely love fatburger but Ive had so many negative experiences at this location I refuse to patronize them again  No way ,negative,157780
I ordered the chicken enchiladas  Ive had way better enchiladas in other Mexican restaurants  It was pretty disappointing  My friend ordered the chicken fajitas  which looked better than the enchiladas  But she said it also wasnt the best she ever had  So in conclusion  I wouldnt come back  But if I had to  get the fajitas ,negative,2513798
Omg I think this is the best location in Las Vegas   when I go to this location I always get my organic snacks  organic rice  and organic vegetables here   this location seems to always have organic jasmine rice  the reason why I love this whole foods!  the organic garlic hummus with organic pita chips are the best!  also  the organic milk chocolate covered pretzels are so addicting! anything organic and nongmo you will find here  however  some things are not organic   bring your recyclable bags to save the earth and save money!,positive,4032787
This was my 2nd  and last  time staying at The Palms  When we checked in we were informed the pool was closed for renovations  The pool was my #1 reason for booking this hotel in the first place and there was NO indication the hotel was going through major renovations at the time that I booked  Other reasons I give this place 1 star? The room was falling apart  Wallpaper peeling off the walls  the lock on the door was broken and falling off  there was trash in the hallways  and the service was horrible ,negative,5625667
I didnt eat at BIG mikes  I ate at Milios  I dont know which location  but it was downtown in amongst the UW campus and State buildings  It was very cold that day  around 19 degrees  So  I will just post my review here  It was good! I had the Pilgrim  What a novel idea  keep the sandwich simple and make it good (why dont you learn something Subway!) I highly recommend Milios  and I highly recommend very little ,positive,2000441

Staff always seems annoyed and possibly the worst shrimp tempura Ive ever had  You could literally taste the unwashed grill  I couldnt finish it  My experiences have been very mixed at this place  at times the food is decent but other times its bad  Try your luck here if thats your thing  but I probably wont be coming back ,negative,4569384

Live this place for watching the after dinner coffee dessert scene  I have seen first dates  mafia meetings  90 yr old Ukraine sisters and prom hot messes  The dessert and coffee are always a delight  But  the one time I went for lunch decided on bagel and Lox with salad  It was great  Even the salad dressing like a light olive oil  And I never like salad dressing!,positive,3440341
My friend and I went for lunch here  I found this place on Google Search  and the Vegetarian and Vegan options on their menu told me they had plenty of options for me  We were a bit skeptical as we walked in because there was no one else other than us during the peak  weekday lunch time but the food and service turned out great  Of all the baklavas I have ever tasted so far  I liked the one here the most (just the right amount of sweetness)  They probably do not get noticed that much because they are hidden away in a tiny corner of a strip mall  and they cannot be spotted easily from the road  My friend and I enjoyed the experience and intended making this one of our favorite lunch spots ,positive,3732285
Finally strolled into this joint and had a seat  The mint julep was something to write home about; boozy with an authentic herbal hit followed by the brandy sweetening the bevvy  Now to food    The sauce for the shrimp ap was amazing and Im still burping garlic  which is actually delicious (despite being potentially disgusting)  The blackened tofu was also flavourful fun  The calimari was good  but Im not sure why people were raving about it  The service was okay (our server was new)  Super clean restrooms ,neutral,1119809
service was good  beers were good  and the food is ok  but whats up with the owner? I was in there a few weeks ago with my fiance and noticed a big  grumpy fat guy with a permanent scowl on his face   he was pacing around the floor  obviously irritated and in a foul mood   At one point he was raising his voice at around the waitress  and I even heard cursing(he dropped the fbomb) at the staff  Because of that I only left one star  How unprofessional  There are plenty of bars in this neighborhood we wont be returning to this one ,negative,6627335
The atmosphere is beautiful inside  The food is excellent  The service is great  It was a little hard to find at first  It should be very beautiful in the summer dinning outside too  We will come again ,positive,4767534
With the restaurant more than half empty during dinner service  I would expect service to be exceptionally faster  After we were seated  we waited for the wait staff to offer us a drink (which is instantaneous in most restaurants) or ask what wed like to eat  We got neither after waiting more than 5 minutes  We then left ,negative,6412278
Yes its cheap but you can tell the quality of food is not all that  I ordered the salmon teriyaki set with the dragon rolls  Salmon was okay  but required a bit more teriyaki sauce and the sushi was below average  The rolls were mostly rice which got us full quickly  Wouldnt recommend this place  Mehh ,negative,6504927
I do not recommend this place at all!!! Not only did they get my order wrong  it took longer to get our check than it did to get our food!!!! The service here sucks!!!!  It may be busy because of the game  but thats no reason for bad service!!! If the music is too loud to here your customers  then turn it down!!!!,negative,2009609
Got my home carpet cleaning today and it was done within an hour  The tech Joe was on time worked quickly and got to work shortly after his arrival  Informed me everything I need to maintain our carpets clean as long as possible  Not only did I reschedule multiple times (sorry)  The owner Rick was very accommodating and responded quickly in which made my experience  with the process completely stress free   definitely will recommend them ,positive,1397055
The decor of the place is super cute  I enjoyed the neon lights  quirky decor and the night life atmosphere that it created  Came here with a coworker for drinks after a long day and the margaritas did not disappoint  We each got our own tacos but the true VIP of the meal was the True Corn  Avocado Caesar w/ Chicken salad  It was creamy deliciousness! Our own server seemed M I A  at times but it seemed like they worked as a team because there was always some one to help us get something ,positive,4818219

Stopped by for lunch after hearing amazing comments about this restaurant   Very disappointed  no one to greet me  stood there a few minutes found a menu after reading it someone finally came to seat me   The restaurant is extremely dark   I ordered the prime rib which had no flavor and was cold for a 23 00 dollar lunch   I will not be returning or recommending this over priced place to anyone ,negative,4600852

this place is a straight throw back to simpler times     when you just wanted to sit down and have yerself a dog and a soda    and a float  and a sundae     plus  after yer done fillin yerself up with all the delicious foodie goods  feel free to walk it off as you meander and shop yer way through the vintage offerins  good food  great antiquing  amazing atmosphere ,positive,6645471
Great food  quaint atmosphere  decently priced  The servers are friendly and the area is adorable  Breakfast is fantastic here  I recommend the apple pancakes with apple cider syrup  The food is all made with intention and Im pretty sure from scratch The farmhouse is adorable and there are only a few tables to each room ,positive,1487372
The good: excellent choice of colors  The bad: I was waiting 15 min after my appt  I only get a cut down on my fingernails  and my right hand was a lot shorter than my left  And all my nails were uneven  My thumbs looked like Bobby Browns haircut circa late 80s  Im annoyed  I wont be going back ,negative,4899376
If youre looking for home cook style or comfort food  then this place is your jam  The prices are reasonable  just dont expect fine dining  We got their beef & lamb dumplings & chicken dumplings and they were good  We also got the salt and pepper pork chop  it was a tad bit too salty but otherwise its pretty good ,neutral,3159591
They washed 187 pounds for me and had it  ready by the next morning  Got me and my wife out of a jam  They replaced one garment that got some slight heat damage  they didnt have to do that but went far and beyond customer service  Will definitely use them again!,positive,5140914
CROOKS THEIVES AND LIARS!!!! DO NOT RENT FROM HERE!! I was 3 HOURS late so they took it upon themselves to pick up the car from Food City  Left me my husband and my 4 year old son to carry over $100 in groceries  On top of that they kept my $200 deposit  NOBODY GETS THAT BACK!!! EVER!!! They add a ton of BS extra things to keep your money  I paid $400 cash for a beat up Impala!!,negative,623207
Its a little shop but dont be fooled because there are tons of Zombie goodies here Thanks to George Romero and Tom Savini were pretty much a Zombie Capitol  Anything and everything Zombie can be found here from tshirts to games  baby gear  Zombie Teddy Bears  glassware  books  you name it  they have it To me this is a groovy place to take first time visitors to our fine city The owner Chuck is a Lawrenceville fixture  Super personable guy Very informative on all things Zombie and Larryville ,positive,3249520
We came here for a tour of Akhob  James Turrells art installation  They give you a detailed tour of all the art pieces in the store before you enter the installation  The entire tour and installation experience is about 45 mins  Keep in mind  no photos are allowed in the store or in the installation  Akhob is completely worth checking out but make your reservation as far in advance as possible (I think they take reservations one month out but not entirely sure)  They do not at all take walkins  What I found really thoughtful was the fact that tours are private to your group only so you get to experience the installation with just your group and not with strangers  Its a real special experience Turrell also has a public installation in The Shops at Crystals that are a short walk from the Louis Vuitton store and near the entrance to the Aria tram  You can go nuts and take all the pictures you want there (my photos are only from that installation) ,positive,5965046
Food was delicious  ambiance relaxing and the staff was incredible! Definitely recommend checking it out  we had avocado toast and eggs in a basket! Both were delicious  Great patio space and energy if youre looking to have brunch!,positive,1224110
Brent was our tour guide and he was awesome! He had a good mix of content about the city  the history  things to do  and good places to dine or drink  He was also really good at including different members of our tour group in his stories and activities the whole time  The tour stopped for a piss break at Heist Brewery  giving us plenty of time to grab sealed beverages to bring back to the bus  They have bottle openers and a corkscrew on the bus which was very convenient This show is 17  and they are clear that no children are allowed  This was a selling point for me  but for others just be sure to keep this in mind  This is a great tour for any outoftowners  newtotowners  or if youre like me and are looking for a cool thing to do with your out of town guests ,positive,594386
Came here on a Friday night and thanks to my friend Tina and her promoter  we got an amazing table with bottle service  The music was amazing!

great point to start with the islands  however this leg of the island is only serviced by the ferry during the summer months  the beaches are very much hit or miss  some of the more quiet beaches have alot of debris  as they are not maintained  as well as the main gas/eletrical lines is floating in one section of the beach on this side  the nude beach is a cool option  if youre into that  fall is a really good time to see this section of the island  but you have to walk from wards ferry drop off  and its a bit of a walk  and then you have to walk back  bring a camera  and comfy shoes,positive,6582689

Total bummer  another one bites the dust  Twice in a row weve received subpar food  We went tonight because I had an offer for a free birthday pizza  Tonight we ordered nachos that were burnt and fries that came out still raw asked for replacement  They were clearly warmed over in the microwave   Then our pizza came out cold  By then I just wanted the experience to be over but  my hubby just couldnt let it be  The manager brings the already well cooked  cold pizza out within minutes  Looked at the manager cross eyed  So  lets see  now I have a warm burnt pizzayum ,negative,5708921

Been coming to this location since they opened  Their gas prices are well below the nearest competitors but the layout of the pumps and lines can get a bit frustrating at times  Really wanted to use this rating for an employee Teresa that was working in the photo department  She was very polite and helpful in showing us how to access our files on the phone and transfer the pictures to the computer  The prints came out great and we appreciated her help  Always keep your beautiful smile Teresa,positive,466075

This place is outstanding! It is super clean and the staff is friendly! I had the breakfast burrito and a breakfast sandwich that both were outstanding  The inside seating area is limited but I love all the windows that let in great light  Cant wait to go back,positive,5497085
Ive come here twice for an oil change and have been happy each time      the wait time is a bit long considering I went in right when they opened at 8am  but the staff is friendly and they pointed out a couple things that are in need of changing so I am aware of what is falling apart without pressuring me to change it at that moment  ill be back to get more services done in the future,positive,3037503
Friday  4:45  End of most work weeks  Im gonna run one errand and as the door closes I hear a loud bang  It opens a couple of inches and stops  The cables are slack  not a good sign Yelp reviews speak positively of Apex  I call  Quinn answers after switching over from another call  Says Zach is 30 minutes away and will be on the way  Great!Zach arrives on time  Quickly diagnoses what the problem is  which is the second time a Wayne Dalton product has let me down  All that is left is the door  which still works ok  but Ill never use their product again Anyway  Zach quickly and courteously gets to it  Finishes quickly and completely  Performs some preventative maintenance on the door and opener  Educates me Didnt have a garage door company before today  I do now  Highly recommended ,positive,1285424
giving it only 2 star because Ive actually been to tapas  this place was not the authentic kind!,negative,6577717
Good NY style Chinese food! I recently tried this place and was very happy with the price  value  and taste  I ordered a dinner combo of the crispy scallion chicken  it was tasty  came with fried rice and an egg roll  and it was made to go relatively quickly! Based on the one visit  I would recommend! As of now  I do like NY restaurant more(in Cornelius)  BUT I will take one for the team and keep trying this place again  and again  and again!,positive,1341633
Man  I love this place! I love it enough to write a yelp review  which I rarely do  My husband and I walked in without a reso around 5:45 and were able to get a seat right at the bar  Really cool design and layout  Bar area felt spacious  easy to eat at the bar without feeling like youre taking over someone elses space  Daniel was behind the bar and was so lovely  Excellent service  He helped us choose some cocktails (all of which he and Fern  one of the other bartenders  created) and suggested some delicious food  Also took the time to chat with us   Cocktails were well balanced  The scotch one is SO GOOD  We got the chicken (amazing)  carrots  brussels (amazing)  wagyu beef carpaccio  and rabbit toasts  All was perfectly cooked  Expensive  but not overly so comparative to other restaurants in the downtown area  Wine list is small  but they are expanding it over the next little bit apparently ,positive,3576288
Dont order a Bottled Coke  Its $6 00   Same price as the beer! The Pasole tasted old  The music is so loud you cant talk with anyone  Theyre not sure if its a restaurant or club??,negative,924478
Decent place  willing to work with you  Fighting is typical for any cheap place in town  but its quieter than the trains  The people are friendly enough Some things are sketch  like the 24hour entry notice that they would be putting a magnet on my fridge  on the same day I pay my rent  I dont need a company magnet and you dont need to enter my home to give it to me ,neutral,828750
This is a must stop when in Vegas   The Kobe burgers are extremely flavorful and their wedge fries go hand&hand with them   Their shakes are also very good (but filling)   This is a before and after hangover spot  the food will get you filled up and ready to party  and will get you back on your feet the next day after partying the night away!

Well  Ive been on the London Eye  so when in Vegas for a night (work meeting)  and faced with the the opportunity to ride on the Worlds current tallest Ferris Wheel it seemed a great idea The view as you are going up is definitely obstructed but once you get about 2/3 of the way to the top the view is amazing  I only had my iPhone to take pictures but got some great shots A few critical notes:1) I wish thed dim the lights for night trips   Would allow you to take better photos without the glare of the overhead lights in your pod  2) I also think they should have looked into glarefree glass for the pods     for the same reasons!

Maybe my bar is still way too high from eating Mexican food in Texas  but I thought the food here was mediocre   The bean dip was pretty good  but the chips and salsa were uninteresting and the pork belly tacos I got tasted mostly like bland fat (some hints of flavor there)   The margaritas were just OK There isnt much seating here and it gets pretty crowded   The limited hours may contribute to that   On the plus side  the service is pretty good and the interior decorations  while sometimes corny  make for a fun feel ,neutral,3591118

My ac started leaking Wednesday  I called a company and they came to my house and quoted me $7000 for an entirely new system even those he didnt go into my attic he said that needed replacing anyways  So I got Stephens number from a friend and called him Thursday morning  He was at my house after I got off work at 5:30 and was able to tell me that I only needed half a unit and gave me a very affordable price  His guys (Matt & Brian) came that very next day and had the new unit installed in less than 2 hours! They were very respectful and I will be using this company for anything else I need  Thanks again guys  you really saved us from the 115 degrees next week ,positive,3652364

All atmosphere; food is not worth it  We had an indoor creek side table which was quaint  The rest of the indoor tables would be no different than any other restaurant  The service was friendly  Three meals and the only flavor to any of them was the Caesar side salads and sangria  $60 for two adults and 1 child was not worth it  Even the bread was bland  Very disappointed ,negative,226998
Leo and I dont go out to eat together alot   Since I cant put 0 star 1 is what it gets I was looking forward to this eating out with leo It was an awful experience for both of us let me count the ways:1 ) It took them a long time to sit us 2 ) When we got sitter it took a long time again to get our order 3 ) When leo ordered for beer he wasnt given the choices 4 ) The food that we ordered was the rotisserie beef   it wasnt that wonderful 5 ) The server was so much in a hurry that the service was so lousy 6 ) When we were done eating  we were waiting forever  I asked the serve to bring our bill   and she said yah yah yah   and she served other customers  went to the kitchen   and did forgot all about our bill   7 ) Lastly   DIRTY  DIRTY   DIRTY8 ) There were only 4 servers for the whole restaurant which is 1 server for 3 rows long of tablesOur date night was a disaster   we were in and out of there so fast ,negative,3408870
This is one of my favourite standing venues in Toronto  Its that perfect combination of size  intimacy  and accessibility  Many bands on their way up in popularity will make appearances here (usually for a pretty affordable price)  The set up is much better than many similar sized venues  I would highly recommend checking out your favourite artist or band ,positive,5304950
I just picked up my very groomed and happy Brad   These guys were so flexible and accommodating with my ever changing schedule (thanks)  that they should be given an award for customer service!

My wife and I purchased tickets for the High Roller at the same time we booked our hotel room at Planet Hollywood  I would avoid this process at all costs  It was very cumbersome to redeem the ticket  People at high roller couldnt find our reservation and PH said that they dont store that info  Better to just show up and pay at the box office After all that  we had a ball  The entrance to the HR is very elaborate  We went around 11pm on a Thursday night  There was no crowds  We got frozen drinks at the bar and were able to take them in the cabin The cabin was ok  The pictures definitely make it seem a lot nicer  We had 16 ppl in our cabin and it felt like it shouldnt have much more than that  since most people were standing with no place to sit  Views were incredible  Definitely loved the nighttime views of Vegas  I think the HR would be a lot more fun if you could reserve an entire cabin for your party ,neutral,3830908

Stopped in at The Good Egg for breakfast on a Saturday around noon   I appreciated that there were quite a few other folks having a lazy late breakfast   I had the Florentine Benedict  The size of the hollandaise sauce portion was a little bit overwhelming and a little bit too thick but otherwise tasted fine   John had the pancakes  which were huge   He was psyched   Prices were reasonable for a breakfast place  which in Scottsdale is rare   Coffee was too weak for me but they leave a big carafe of coffee and a pitcher of water on the table which is kind of nice   Huge restaurant with plenty of seating   Country decor but not obnoxious   There wasnt anything here that I was blown away by but it was totally edible  homey breakfast food   Id have no problem eating there again ,neutral,4609536
this is my absolute favorite place to shop  its totally affordable and the styles are trendy and cute  comparable to forever 21  but i find rhapsodielle to be much more colorful! also there are a lot of affordable pieces here that are less casual  like stuff you could wear to a party or a club  love it!,positive,6643101
What a wonderful dentist experience!

Went there tonight for the happy hour  excited because it was nearby and looking for another cool wine bar  Asked a number of times about the happy hour and they didnt seem too clear  I tried to confirm a number of times that I wanted happy hour price and looked at the flyer posted on the wall that said five dollar wine until eight  Asked again for happy hour and ordered a drink  When we got our bill each of our glasses were $11 and not five dollars  They said they could take one dollar off each class  That is ridiculous!

Worst papa johns experience ever  ordered a pizza at 7:20 online  Chilled at the house because they told me it would take about 1520 minutes to be ready  Decided to pick up some drinks and arrived at the papa johns around 7:40 or so  paid for the pizza and they said it would be right out  Ended up waiting another 30 minutes in the store for my pizza  Better ingredients  better pizza  longer wait    papa johns!! Pizza was good and the deal was nice since we used the Charlotte Hornets promo code and the entire order was half off  So maybe the employees gave us half effort preparing my pizza as well ,negative,6443022

For a town and are that has great pizza  this was my least favorite I have ever tried   Right up the street and it always seems busy  but just wasnt my thing   Original crust pizza is hard and difficult to eat   Sauce had absolutely no flavor   I dont think the provolone sticks I ordered were provolone   But who knows since they were nothing more than store bought  frozen microwave specials   Didnt try a sub or a soft crust pie  but dont see any reason to either   Just up the street you can find better pizza in the gas station ,negative,1250882
I give Ottos bar a 4Star rating  Im less thrilled with the formal dining area  The bar area has vibe and you can order the full dinner menu in the bar  The cocktails are skillfully crafted    They have lovely blue cheese stuffed olives for the martinis  This makes me happy  When Im hanging out in the bar  I generally order some appetizers and or a desert  The bacon wrapped shrimp is my favorite appetizer  You can get these little gems solo or as part of the Mediterranean platter  which also includes humus and bruschetta  The best desert is the Napoleon  wonderful lightly sweetened phyllo dough provides the structure and a silky custard provides the sexiness ,positive,2076471

Always paid our bill on time and now they are  treating us horribly   We rented a storage unit B096 in early 2017  Our last day in the unit was November 25th  We followed their check out protocol by leaving the storage empty and clean  They told us to leave the door up and they will check us out during their nightly sweep   They then confirmed we were out before 12/1  Much to our amazement they auto deducted December out of our bank account  $131 39  We have called several times to have the money put back in our account since we did not utilize the unit in December   We are given the runaround oh only our manager can do that  We will email him to call you back    They keep stonewalling   I want the money back ASAP  I will be contacting my attorney if the manager does not call us back ASAP   Be aware their check out process is nothing more than a scheme to rip off good paying customers   No more excuses Public Storage   Give us the refund you owe us ,negative,258784
I was very lucky to find Dr Cherringtons office as I had a problem that needed immediate attention  Not only did I have a sit down consultation with Dr  Cherrington  he was able to resolve my issue without hesitation and advise me on future work I need  I have now made my second appointment and am very comfortable coming back  His staff is very friendly and welcoming  a real asset ,positive,2779711
Very yummy! !!!  Service was fast and friendly!  I had the diavolo and my bf had the pan roast    mine was good    wish it was a little more spicy      The pan roast was BEYOND YUMMY!!!

I have always found a great selection and in the past have been greeted promptly upon entering each department  I must say though  that the last several times I have shopped at NM I have been less than impressed with the customer service  This holiday season I have been to the shoe department  the fragrance counter  various cosmetics counters  and the David Yurman jewelry counter  DY and La Mer were the only place where I found a sales associate without their nose inches from a mobile phone  It is my understanding that each associate has a company phone which they use to contact clients and do various work related tasks  However  it is VERY offputting to be physically present in a store and being made to wait while the associate finishes a text message or email  I completely understand NM wanting to stay abreast of current technology  but there must be a more professional way to do so ,neutral,2182982
Ive been coming for years  and realised I hadnt reviewed Dicks  First of all  Dicks used to be the secret speakeasy no signage brother to Richardsons (prior to the fire and relocation)  The bar is a single counter with a few tables  Now the back room is a much larger space that can house a meeting  party or over flow tables For those unfamiliar with the menu: Dicks provides amazing authentic New Mexican food  The chile (despite the warning label) isnt too spicy  When I need my fix on green Chile  I always head over  Favorites: green chile potatoes  smoked turkey enchiladas and the fresh fish of the day (which there is an abundance of specials)  Note: Red chile is much spicier than the green chile but typically you should order based on your preference ,positive,2973935

Had some late night hunger for some hot n sour soup  The wife and I stopped by after late night bingo for some Chinese food  She had a full dinner while I had a hot n sour soup to take the hunger edge off  They were a little busy for a little after midnight  so we had a bit of a wait from ordering to getting the food  Appetizers came out with the meals so that was a little off  Food was good and better than expected ,positive,1661269
My review is based in esthetics only as I have never tried their hair services   Mackenzie is my brow goddess and even though its been a while I can say she does a fantastic pedicure as well   Easy location with parking but if you are on transit its a short walk from the Ctrain and loads of buses service the area   The shop itself is an Aveda Salon which means it smells like heaven when you walk in   The only challenge for me is getting past the retail section at the front door as I want all of it   The spa side is quiet and tranquil like you want in a spa   The treatment rooms are a good size so you dont feel like you are in a closet and the pedicure room is nice and bright with lots of room if you come with a friend ,positive,3805218
The repairs done were excellent  It did take longer than expected  SRS system needed more parts replaced than first diagnosed  Overall good job ,positive,4980504
Considering most reviews are about the wait time    It seems like that would be a scheduling issue for the owner/management  Its not really fair to the individual working  Theyre just showing up for a pay check  This 5 stars is for Jonathan who is working as fast and hard as he can on this Monday afternoon  Good job :) Doesnt make since to save payroll expenses if customer service is suffering  Counter productive really  The frustration and high stress of your employees reflect on the customer whom which will remember that experience only  Not the delicious chipotle omelet wrap  which is a winner in my opinion  Jonathan remained professional and apologized sincerely  He was pleasant and stayed in good demeanor  even when running back and forth from counter to drive thru for the entire 15 min I was there ,positive,764575

Sun Chiu Kee is definitely a place Ive gone back time and time again  I love their salt and pepper egg plant  if you love egg plant  you want to order this dish; it might make you love egg plant even more!Sometimes theres a long wait  but that really depends what time you get there  You have to beat out all the regulars that go there haha If youve got a small group of friends  its fun here  Hot pot or just any of their meat dishes are great to share  Two last words: lychee slurpee ,positive,4639706

I will no longer be using this dry cleaner  I like to support local business  but Ive become too fed up with their service to continue using  The latest is I cannot seem to get my shirts back because their laundry service is down  I went the first time to be told that rather than someone calling me and informing me that it would be delayed  She said they would be ready on Friday  I ended up going in Saturday and they still were not back  Again no one bothered to call me that was the case  So now I have driven there twice and I still dont have my clothes  And the best the owner could do was say it was out of her control and offer me 10% off  At this point I dont believe I should have to pay anything but its not worth the effort  I just want my clothes back and then I will be finding another dry cleaner  I would suggest if you want yours back in a timely fashion you do the same ,negative,2842261

Always came to this chipotle and used to love it but havent been coming for awhile  Its not authentic Mexican food  Which I never believed when people said that lol  But I have been trying other places and this one is not my favorite anymore  The queso is not good They charge you for the sides you get  they didnt before  They charge you for guacamole The bowl is pretty big you can share with someone ,negative,249076

After obtaining several bids to paint the interior of my home  I went with Glennys Painting because they were reasonably priced and included the paint  They were on time  professional and did an amazing job!

Zero stars will be more proper  I bought a preowned car as it is and I am glad I went to do a secondary inspection that save me 240$ in fixing things that by contract was actually suppose to be brand new  Then I signed paperwork to them to go on and register my car for a fee I never saw the charge on my card called for 1 week talk to everyone in sales and finally in finance they lost my preper work and I am glad I am so persistent and call 7 times in 2 days to finally found out the truth and I did my own registration on line !!!!

Ive been here on 4 separate occasions and all 4 times  the service and wait time to receive my drink or food was outrageous  I would never dine here just based on the fact that an omelet should never take 45 minutes to get  On a positive note  the back patio is inviting and has activities for the kids to be entertained with  Too bad the service was so slow ,negative,3001453
Troy recently came by to install a new counter top as well as put up some monitor mounts at our Mesa store   He was extremely professional  there on short notice  and did a FANTASTIC job   The new oak counter top couldnt look better!

Phils is my go to place if I cant bear the thought of cooking or if I have very little time to get food in my belly  A Restaurant Makeover success story (because we all know those are somewhat rare) I have to pretend its not nearly across the street from me in order to ensure that I dont make myself sick on BBQ  Their prices have slowly climbed and in my mind the taste factor has diminished  I dont eat pork so I cant tell you how good or bad it is  but the last few times I have eaten there I have found the brisket sandwich to be dry and lacking of flavour   One saving grace is all of their sides are yummy and the hush puppies are to die for   Their service is also a bit scatterbrained and there seems to be a help wanted sign on the window quite often    Nevertheless give it a spin if you want quick  still affordable  and simple barbeque ,negative,4195242

I had both Tiffani and Aaliyah and they both were great! The service I had was Lash Lift and I was VERY happy with the final result  It definitely beats getting lashes (for me atleast) and it takes an hour for the process  Both ladies were professional and the location is quiet & best kept secret in CLT  I would recommend giving Lash Now a try!,positive,2131211
The food is extremely slooooooow  The bulgogi and kalbi taste mediocre (though better than other Korean places in Montreal) They also force you to pay 15% tip for their bad and slow service  The stove also takes so long to cook and burns pretty easily  When we said that we werent happy with the service  they said that they changed the grill for us so multiple times so they had to charge us 15% (and they did not inform us this when we were dining)  They also told us not to come back and they dont care if we write them a negative review on Yelp  Unbelievable ,negative,4857532

$27 for adult dinners  I expected $20  but after a day of $4 coffee and $8 burgers I just shrugged and went for it  Not worth that price  Tough fish  cold soggy crab legs   And as mentioned  some of the help has an attitude  The best thing there was the fried shrimp  I wouldnt go back  way over priced ,negative,10161
Office is dirty  outdated  Height measure tape and scale are old  the measure tape comes off the wall is bent and taped together   The scale is a drugstore brand  not medical  There are signs all over office advertising skin care product  Staff is unorganized and says the doctor has a poor memory  Doctor prescribes medication without thorough exam  And  does have a poor memory  Stay away!

Best Buffet in Vegas    hands down    Is it more expensive? Yes   Is it worth every penny? Absofreakinlutely!

I really really hate having to peel shrimp Oysters on the half shell   NomNomNomHot king crab legs  Basically all of the food I tried was good to great   Except for    The desserts  They were just alright   Not bad  by any stretch of the imagination  but nothing to write home about either Cons:OMG the line   Ridiculous   Try and go around late lunch or EARLY in the AM   I refuse to pay any more to eat an already expensive meal   This is the only reason why I didnt give it 5 stars   Where it is located  Caesars could totally expand it to include more dining room if they wished   but they dont ,positive,502234
A group of us went for AZ Restaurant Week  I am not sure if it was all the large graduation parties or lack of experience with the Restaurant Week menu but service was a disaster  We waited 15 min for a first drink and it only got worse from there  finally after our dinner was served before our appetizer and we refused it  a manager stepped in and things got a bit better  We really appreciated his help The food was really good which made it extra disappointing that things were so disorganized  Additionally on both of the plates that included vegetables  the veggies were cold  By then we had given up trying to get things right  We were there just under 2 hours for a very basic meal  The waiter was very apologetic once he caught up but I am not sure if I would try it again ,neutral,100397
Just went out to try Zips! The server had at least 3 Monsters  Red Bulls or some kind of Speed freak drink! Ordered our drinks took awhile then ordered some food took forever and it wasnt busy  The waitress was back at our table 5 times before our food arrived and five more times while we were trying to eat! Happy hour 8 till close specials Monday night wings and Skewers ordered shrimp Skewers and by the way they are not on the special just the Chicken  Wings were awesome and the Shrimp  Frys were greasy sticks  Also ordered chicken cheese and green chile spring rolls and had the manager stop by so I cut one open and asked where is the cheese and chiles? Went to some explanation about there process of making them  a dry chicken breast roll and sad Sauce  And when we were ready to leave  where did the waitress go? Probably opening another Monster! And No one has ever complained! Amazing!,negative,3359419
The hostess and the waiter seemed like nice people  Too bad that the appetizer and entrees came out slowly and tasted mediocre at best  The pulledpork nachos could have used more cheddar cheese and more avocados in the guacamole  My crusted Atlantic cod could have been cooked a bit longer  It was difficult to cut with my butter knife and fork  and I kept poking it with my finger to make sure that it was not cold and raw  I left half of it on my plate  and I commented to my husband that I was still hungry  My husbands chicken and gnocchi tasted just OK according to him  and he said that we would never return to this restaurant  The waiter did bring drink refills ,negative,4905429
Definitely should have listened to the other reviewers before coming here  I went in on a Sunday morning and ordered the Sunrise Harvest breakfast bowl which tasted pretty good  but be warned it comes in a small box with an even smaller portion  The wait time was also way longer than it should have been  The staff were all lovely and pretty knowledgable about the menu  but I was disappointed to see that they have egg in everything on the breakfast menu so to make it vegan  they just take out ingredients instead of replacing them  Even though they had an alright variety of options  this place probably isnt worth the money  Will most likely not be spending almost $10 on a sampler sized breakfast here ever again ,neutral,845707

Looking to two OTHER companies in the Vegas area ,negative,4435686
4 stars because the taco ingredient options and combinations are amazing  as are the guacamole options  and the service  Not 5 stars because the tacos are served on flour tortillas (albeit homemade) by default  which really is a shame  but because the wait staff fail to mention that corn tortillas are an option   And  We are still trying to perfect making our own corn tortillas is weak; its simply not a priority ,positive,54190
Dont get to know them too well  you will be sorry  In Las Vegas people can snatch and grab shit  no questions asked  but if you have a dispute of the most minor you will pay  Torrey Pines is petty to the extreme which is sad  I wish I had never walked in there because the last thing anyone needs is fake friends and fake associates ,negative,919093
Service: Great   We were greeted by every wait staff we passed on the way in and out   Waitress was fast Sushi: Not 5 star but the best in the area   It was fresh Decor: Nice modern interior that looks more like a wine bar or lounge   A bit dark for my liking  but to each their own We went on a Tuesday night and it had people coming in   Hopefully they will be around for a while ,positive,4429061
Very disappointing  Atmosphere was great  Old Italian music playing  Looked fun and great That is where it ended  Our server said she was new and couldnt answer basic questions about the food  I ordered a sweet tea and received a raspberry iced tea  Then someone came by to refill my tea and refilled it with unsweetened tea  HmmmmDinner comes with salad and bread  Bread was very good  Nice oil and vinegar dip Salad left us wondering what the hell?? Just really nothing to it  Just boringEntreesSpaghetti and Meatballs and Baked Penne Pasta with Meatballs The sauce they use is sweet and tomatoey  Yech  Just not very good Meatballs were full of herbs that overpowered the flavor  Big size too much herbal flavor Will keep looking  Must be affordable great Italian food somewhere in this towm,negative,5814308
The restaurant is delicious  My favorite thing to order is the Molcajete Trio with corn tortillas  The 1 person order is enough to feed 2  maybe 3  people and I eat ALOT so I always get the 2 person order so I can take some home  The price is definitely worth it though  All the other dishes are great as well  They have a live music playing at times and you can request certain songs  The weekends are very busy but worth the wait  The only downfall is the parking is limited especially on a busy day ,positive,4981762
I love the family owned small little restaurants tucked away indiscreetly in the small strip malls  These are the true meals not the processed factory food served by chains I hunkered down for a lunch special at 3pm and the restaurant was busy ( a good sign)I enjoyed a satisfying Red Curry Lunch special with Thai soup for under $10Unobtrusive service and fresh quality ingredients from the grocery store next door makes for a winnerWhen you enjoy Thai  it is best served with background music from the home country recommeneded!,positive,2415737
I have to say I am pretty darn impressed The bar is beautiful  the lighting is great  the service is fast and friendly  and the food is pretty darn good  What an upgrade!I came here a few times in the past and never really had a good experience  though I did hear people talk about how great the Avenue was back in the day  While this doesnt feel like a classic Wisconsin bar anymore  I do appreciate the modern and clean feel  As far as the food and drink goes  my bloody mary was delicious (served with a nice beer back) and my biscuits and gravy were some of the best I have ever had  I really enjoyed having something a little different as their gravy is not the standard white sausage gravy  instead they have a red eye gravy with ham  The biscuits were especially great  buttery and flaky to the max  The eggs were perfectly overmedium and the potatoes were cooked and seasoned well  but nothing special  Overall I would say I am pretty darn happy with the first brunch of my 2016!,positive,2284428

Pumpkin Picking was a joke  $2 50 entrance then we have to walk all the way to a pumpkin patch because theres no tractor  When we get there  its a small area the size of 1/3 of a football field and theres about 20 pumpkins scattered around as if they had been picked at another farm and scattered in that lot  Half of them were rotted or spoiled by other people  It was very disapointing yet the lovely lady at the desk gladly gave us a refund when we explained our situation We did not try apple picking so do not use the 2 star rating as reference for that If you do happen to pass by this farm: PICK UP A CASE OF APPLE MUFFINS THEY ARE THE BEST THINGS THAT EVER HAPPENED TO THIS PLANET  Perfect texture and taste and wont empty your wallet ,negative,4387

Ive been to congee queen at its various locations in the GTA  Every time Ive went  the quality has been consistent  Unfortunately  when I went with my family here on New Years  my experience was absolutely terrible  The service was very quick paced  but that wasnt my issue  It was the fact that the waiter had spilled hot tea all over my lap  Moving on to the food  the quality and quantity were way below average  The house super bowl congee only had 1 or 2 pieces of salmon and shrimp floating on top  And that was literally it! After  the seafood fried rice came and it was dry and under seasoned  Lastly  the rice roll with shrimp came and it had a hard texture  not the chewy and soft kind that I was hoping for ,negative,3023222
Wow  excellent dinner and service  The ribs special was meaty ( not skimpy) cooked to perfection and spiced right  If they have that special and you like ribs consider that dish  The ricotta gnudi with their own special sausage and marinara sauce was delightful  Our tall Hendricks and tonics with cucumber were spot on ,positive,6476700

Really disappointed  First time I have used this lounge and it was capacity controlled with waiting times until they could find a seat and mine was against a wooden ledge   This is one of the benefits of their $495 fee and what is the value if you cant even get entry to a comfortable seat  Once inside the food choices are better than other lounges but to be honest it was such a bad experience I went back to United lounge so I could have a comfortable seat and light snacks ,negative,4297687

Ive eaten at 2 different locations now (Las Vegas and Colorado) and both times have not been impressed  Both locations they messed up my food and it came out late  Our server at the Las Vegas location was not very quick / attentive with our table  When our drink glasses were empty  they were taken away and not once did anyone ask if any one of us wanted anything more to drink (very  very weird)  Food was good  but the whole experience is what makes the restaurant  And the fact that my dinner  again  was messed up and they didnt even offer a drink or nothing for the inconvenience really annoyed me  Not sure if I will return since this happened twice already   ,negative,3040013

In due time )   I feel like I qualify at this point to write a review on a tattoo shop because I now have 6 tattoos (Who knew?! ) 4 of which are from this here studio   OBVIOUSLY the other 2 were from amateur shops   27 Tattoo is the most pristine shop Ive seen and has killer decor  Sometimes  I just want to sit in there and hang out  because   Anthony (he and his wife own the shop) has done all of my little pieces (and my sisters) and never disappoints   I keep going back for more; cant stop wont stop   Hes the master of dot work  so if you want dots   book with him immediately  Hes basically booked until 2020   Quit being boring and go get a tattoo  people! Even if its a dot   #hipster,positive,2916187
We love the D Backs and have been going to Chase Field for 20 years  since it was known as Bob (Bank One Ballpark ) The retractable roof is great in the early and late season  They generally keep it closed during the summer due to the heat  Its great to get out of the heat and enjoy the game   The only bad part is when you walk out afterwards  forgetting about the outside  and walk into a wall of heat If you can do it  go during the week in the afternoon  Tickets are a little cheaper and the crowds are a lot smaller Concessions are concessions  There is a large variety and youll pay way too much  Its a ballpark  so what do you expect?,positive,6068639
I got here a bit early  before the real party atmosphere kicked in  but that gave me the chance to really appreciate the ambiance and the mellow crowd  Drinks were reasonable  No on tap beer  but a good selection of bottles at a decent price A bit of a challenge to find  but well worth the effort!,positive,2089100
How can I explain this place let me just say damn good first impression wasnt the greatest due to all the Flies but I believe one of the managers of the place when I brought it to his attention he made sure that he removed everything that a fly was near just because of the quality and that shows a lot for institution that text customer advice especially when youre dealing with insects outside that this place is amazing food quality homemade sausage bacon just a quality and care that they took into every aspect of the meal was awesomeMake sure that you get out here and visit Henhouse Cafe theres two locations one in Mesa and one in Gilbert I am very impressed with the quality of food and service that they provided today awesome job guys thank you so much greatly appreciate it and you will see me again,positive,1786703
Staff was very rude  They sat us down at a dirty table that was sticky  Ordered appetizers and the waitress gave us dirty plates and silverware  Music was overly loud could not even hear my friends talk  Food is terrible and very pricey! Do not go here!!!!,negative,4574245
Food was good specially the panang curry    The only I didnt like is that the place smells like cigarette and it bothers me the restO and the bar is connected with no partition    And the resto is a little dirty the tables are not wiped knowing that they just opened and there was a fly flying around   I dont recommend the restO if u have kids maybe when u sit outside at the patio maybe    I think they should clean up the store more and I wish the restO and bar is separated so that it wont smell cigarette    Other than that we enjoyed the food    And the price is not bad    Will be back for the food but next time probably would be take out or delivery   ,neutral,1228288

We ordered our Frrrozen Hot Chocolate from the walk up window  it was perfect for us as we didnt want to sit and be served   We just wanted a Frrrozen Hot Chocolate on the go!It tasted exactly like the the Serendipity 3 in New York  However  in New York I feel like the overpriced $10 dessert goes towards the ambiance  the experience  the cute tables/chairs and oldfashiony ice cream dishes In Vegas  we got a plastic cup handed to us through a little window and later we were like  huh  $10 for a shake    Even still  Id do it all over again tomorrow   Whats $10 in Vegas anyways?  It just meant I had $10 less to lose in the Wizard of Oz penny slots!,positive,6084690
This park is a pleasant surprise for the area and is very well maintained  Wetlands Park is a new favorite area to exercise outdoors when Im tired of the treadmill If I had little ones Id be here all of the time  I noticed a nice nature center and a list of programs for the kids  The building near the main parking lot seemed nice with clean bathrooms nearby  The whole park feels like a place somewhere outside of Las Vegas  As youd expect in a wetlands park there are tall grasses and humidity  Water runs by areas of the trails  Most of the park has paved trails and there are gravel trails in between paved trails  There are several clean bathrooms near the main parking area  Also near the main parking lot is a playground for the kids ,positive,5384577
All hype  no heart  Great service  food is good but If there is a line  go somewhere else We stepped into this Americana time bubble in the heart of the plateau and were greeted by Hymie  the legend himself  He makes sure people are seated as promptly as possible and oversees a welloiled machine  As we wait  we read all the numerous articles depicting Beautys as a must Montreal attraction; we are overflowing with excitement like kids in line at the amusement park The couple ahead of us said they came all the way from the West Island   Damn  this must be good I thought We ordered omelettes  french toast and some trademark smoothies We were promptly served  To be perfectly candid  the food was ok  you can have this at any other breakfast place  Surprisingly  the bagels were really mediocre  The $6 5 smoothies are actually quite good and were the best part of the meal  You can come and have a filling breakfast but there is no enlightenment here ,neutral,227603

Never had a bad experience here    the food is always good    service very efficient and nice (been in the service industry over 20 years)   To go orders are always quick and everything is hot and tasty when i get it home   Food here always reminds me of home    especially the Meat Jun ,positive,3860067

One of the baristas  Tori  was awesome  I called with a few questions about caffeine content and about how long boba lasts (because it was late & I wanted to get a drink for tomorrow morning)  She was genuine  sounded happy to help  and she gave me honest information  Im pretty sure it was her willingness to answer my questions and her friendliness that brought me in tonight  She ended up being the person to take my order and her sweet personality made my second visit to Tea Swirl especially pleasant  Having a great product with just enough options is one thing that Tea Swirl does well  but what really makes this place stellar is the customer service  I ordered the jasmine milk tea half sweet with boba and it came out just right  Id have to agree with the statement I saw in another review: Tea Swirl is the best boba in Tempe ,positive,4067845

So we are from the east coast and weve never heard of Culvers before  We were driving from Madison to Milwaukee and needed some drive thru fast food and saw the Arbys sign and exited the highway  As we were turning into the Arbys we saw the Culvers and were like    What is that? Should we try it? Best  Decision  Ever  The burgers are on par with or better than InNOut and actually look better in real life than the pictures on the drivethru menu! The patties have a bit of a char which was amazing and gave the burger a satisfying crunch  The fries are better than any other fast food fries Ive ever had  Theyre perfectly crispy and burnyourmouth hot  which is how I like them  The custard is worth coming here for that alone   Im almost glad I dont live here or Id eat here way too much  Good Job  Wisconsin! My only dings are that they didnt give us any ketchup or ask us if we wanted any and only gave us like two napkins  Just minor technicalities ,positive,4524879
Went here for breakfast today with a friend  The special was a spinach scramble  which my friend had  I had the Belgian waffle   Both dishes were excellent   We arrived at about 8:00 a m  on a Tuesday morning  so no wait at all   Only complaint: the music was a bit too loud Definitely a winner!,positive,6230181

Close  Cheap and Convenient keeps me coming back to Howards  and with a name like Howards  it speaks DIY and Home Improvement  Sure theres those other big box stores  but sometimes its just too big (TWSS)  Parking at Howards is a breeze  even with the construction going on  and getting in and out on Indian School Road is not too bad  either (Im never in a hurry  though) Unlike most Ace Hardware stores  this location is smaller  but like most  compact and well stocked  Always plenty of employees to bug you and ask if you need any help  I particularly like Howards because of his nuts  Hell sell you just one  which is sometimes all I need  not a whole bag like those aforementioned big box behemoths Hopefully with the new construction finishing soon  they will stay small and maintain their great personal service  The parking lot will improve  and access could be better  but not by much ,positive,748498
The first time I visited noodle head with friends I was very apprehensive  Thai food can be intimidating with its intense flavors and aromas  Noodle head has the secret to Thai food  Not only is the food great and prepared in a quick fashion its also BYOB  The atmosphere can range from family fun to date night  A wonderful place I highly recommend  One of the  if not  the best Thai restaurant around the city  Very very affordable especially for those college students! Try something out of your comfort zone!!,positive,4833662
My wife and I are from California  and when we were looking for a place to have breakfast  we found this whole in the wall that we fell in love with  They do the best Huevos Rancheros and carne Asada tacos  Really reasonable prices and their service is decent  I will recommend coming here if you want to have Mexican food and dont want to spend so much money on the strip ,positive,3822401
We were in the mood for sushi  wanted to try somewhere new  many reviews pointed us to Roka Akor  so we gave it a shot  Fantastic service! Extremely limited sushi menu without a true sushi bar  and tiny portions of sashimi  However  the quality was excellant  Yet  we left quite unsatisfied and a bit hungry  Nothing Sweet Republic couldnt cure! ;) This establishment is for trendy folk who value presentation ,neutral,6163225
Was there last weekend but have to admit not the best  Starters ok but mains were far from good  Specialty is meant to be ribs but my son and I had those with the same sauce yet it was like eating 2 different types of food  Not cheap either and of course the wait to be seated whilst a lot of empty tables just makes you irritated ,negative,5929145

Literally my SECOND time at any chipotle  I really thought it was weird to rush me in a non existent line  I also find is funny that you ran out of salad and filled on the bottom of half of what she gave the older couple in front of me  while you yelled for me  I had to ask for more lettuce because she didnt fill it up  Yall gave the older couple a nice amount of chicken  I literally threw away half of my salad because you gave me half a freaking spoon full  I will never come back here again for a 7 dollar sandwich when I can go up the road and get a buffet for 8 dollars with fresh fruits and veggies with salad  VERY disappointed Update: the hispanic lady whose there on week day openings is the best!

Well what could you possibly expect from a mexican restaurant brought to you by the folks who brought you Jose Cuervo tequila (One drink    and youll never drink tequila again!)?  In the Las Vegas airport?  I mean low expectations  right?  I thought the service was courteous and efficient   They had chalula hot sauce on the table   My chicken quesadilla was a good value for the money which I believe is something I have never said about any meal Ive ever eaten at an airport ever   They have those cool Oaxacan animal sculptures as decoration   It is what is  but it has got to be the best restaurant the C wing of McCarran airport has to offer ,neutral,6203227
The only authentic izakaya of Las Vegas  definitely worth visiting for a casual night out with hungry friends   If you love to drink and enjoy authentic  off the beaten path menu items of Japan uncommon at your local Japanese restaurant  this is the place for you   Be prepared and keep in mind that its an izakaya where quiet dining is not to be expected   Despite this jewel of a find out here in the desert I give it only four stars due to the rather disappointing ramen experience which was nothing more than what it seemed like noodles in miso soup   I have yet to find a good ramen place which unfortunately does not exist in Las Vegas   ,positive,4939459

We went to the location on Sossaman and have been there before for their burgers   This trip we were both charged  59 cents each for the cheese choice  and I asked for mayo to go on mine with lettuce and tomato  and onion   I was shocked to see they even charged me  35 for the mayo   This place is padding the bill with things that normally at other places there is no charge for   At $9 79 for a burger and fries on the side  there is plenty of profit there without padding the bill with nonsense adds   Glad I hadnt asked for pickles too  geeze!,negative,6152491
I went to Westside market Saturday with daughter    She saw dried fruit at this place I was told it was $7 99 per pound  with a small being 1 pound   We ordered a small and I saw the weight of 1 01 pounds   This man then charged me $9   Straight ripped me off by a dollar   I mean why do it?  The market was not crowded on a Saturday morning   If people are treated like this I can see why   Vendors  want you to buy then give you a bad experience    The dried fruit was so so   The customer service poor ,negative,2824728
The best value for sushi in CLT  Hesitant to write this review as if word spreads about this place  will never be able to get a table   It is very small and just a shade above hole in the wall category The only place that rivals this is Enso  but prices there are 23x higher ,positive,4792624
When the temperature is around 90 to 100 degrees on the daily  having a refreshing lemonade is the BEST  I really hope they expand and open up more locations because I am OBSESSED with this place I am attempting to try all the lemonade flavors at least once  Lemonade flavors tried:Mango Pineapple Lemonade Lava FlowLilikoi Strawberry Watermelon PLG (passion  lemon  guava) Lavender BlackBerry So far my favorite ones are  Mango Pineapple  Lavaflow and the Lilikoi Strawbery I love their mason jars and everyone that works here is SO NICE and wonderful  If you bring your mason jar back  its 50 cent off!,positive,6360408
Il Fornaio is inside NYNY  and you can eat within the restaurant or in a gated area on the casino floor  The restaurant is always clean  and has an upscale feel  despite being in a casino  The food it a bit overprice  but it is Vegas  so you grow to expect that  My one concern about this place is the pasta dishes are a little too fatty  There is a right way and a wrong way of doing pasta  and I feel like Il Fornaio is trying to cover their pasta up rather than letting it shine  I had the manicotti  and it was just soso  I wish the flavors were a bit more robust  What I will about Il Fornaioi is that their bread is unbelievably good  If you dont mind more sauce than pasta and a lot of bread to soak it up  youll be fine  I read other reviews that complained about service and management  but I have not had those issues at all  This is a restaurant that has decent food  good ambiance  and not so great value for money ,neutral,3166561
Id rank this lower  if able  I picked up an order to go and the General Tsaos sauce (which was asked to be packaged separately) was broken open  The entire bag was filled with the sauce  For one  it ruined the meal and two it leaked through the paper bag and through a slit in the plastic bag  The sauce was all over the front seat of my brand new Jeep  I called and asked for the manager and explained someone must have packed it incorrectly  because the sauce was on the bottom and the food on top of it (not smartly packed)  He called me a liar and said theres no way it happened  but I pictures to prove it and he hung up on me  NEVER  EVER GO TO THIS ESTABLISHMENT  The smart@ss manager needs to be fired  but Ive found it  its the owners son  so he must think he has the freedom to tell customers what he likes  HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE ,negative,2887790

While this mall wont win any awards for either architecture or trendy stores  it has a good basic mix and a kitchen outlet store (see separate review)    It seems very clean and does not feel at all scary  but compared to the Dufferin mall  its much more suburban and has a much less local flavour ,neutral,6386503

Wanted to give higher for the cleanliness and the very friendly service  but I came here for Pho  It just wasnt very flavorful  Lots of beef  good veggies and basil on the side  but no fish sauce and again  the broth was very flat and bland to me  There are definitley better places for Pho in the area (Simis Cafe)  so I probably wont be back for Pho here  Too bad for a namesake restaurant : (,neutral,5906962
The concept is amazing as well as the building and interior design  But the service is scatterbrained and inconsistent  You are in downtown Phoenix  Dont expect everyone to look like they just came from Arcadia or Gilbert! The service is sorely lacking at this point  No one to make sure our food was prepared correctly or that we even had silverware  And by silverware I mean everything there is disposable which also bugs me  If I wanted to be waited on by careless hipsters I would go to Mill Avenue  I brought a large group there because I spoke highly of it and they wanted to check it out  The bartender knew this but still made me feel like my businesses was no big deal  They were not busy ,neutral,4810846

Its fun becuase its a monorail  but other than that   Its not a good option for getting around on the strip  as the monorail is set so far back from the strip that in order to get to it or the strip from it requires trekking back and forth through casinos  Considering all of the foot time and accumulated distance  you might as well walk the strip I reccomend the bus  For $14 you get a 24 hour pass and there are so many busses running the route at once that the longest I ever waited for one was 5 minutes ,neutral,3263383
Good yogurt  great flavors  very nice staff  and very clean  However  two stars are knocked off because of the price  Its much higher than yogurtland on ft apache and flamingo  which is less than 10 mins up from here  and the one at town square   The higher price per ounce doesnt warrant me to come here again   Three of us with half full cups  and mine(so 4 cups)  was full came to 32 dollars  The exact same thing which we do all the time at yogurtland is 17 dollars ,neutral,1386225

The donuts here taste stale and the employees arent the most welcoming people  This location seems to be out of the donuts I want consistently  This place is really fast with their drive thru service and their indoor service  I enjoy getting the $1 coffee  Their breakfast items are good  I like their egg and sausage croissant  Dunkin donuts coffee is best enjoyed with cream and sugar ,neutral,4821537

Madison Avenue has most definitely upgraded by moving their salon to the much nicer Chandler and 48th Street location  However  I think most of their hair stylists are pretty mediocre  and their prices are high for the quality of cut and color you receive  I have yet find a hair stylist there that was worth the money and have decided to look elsewhere On the flip side  if I could give 5 stars to Pearl  who has worked there forever doing waxing and facials  I absolutely would  Her prices are reasonable and my eyebrows are always perfect  Side note: As a regular customer of almost 6 years  it also irritated me that earlier this year they refused to give me a gift certificate for a nonprofit fundraising auction I was organizing  I understand that times are tough  but I am long time customer who has given them several referrals  They need to appreciate and support the community ,negative,3570416

Wow! Dr  Woolf and his staff really care about their patients!  During the busy holiday rush I came down with an eye infection on both eyelids and it was extremely painful  At first I was going to go to urgent Care  but my husband urged me to go to the expert! Dr  Woolf! As it happened  I was driving by his office and decided to just stop in and see if they could get me in somehow  I knew it was a long shot but I was in serious pain   The front desk was so kind and was able to get me in right away! Dr  Woolf prescribed me some oral antibiotics and and eye cream and also unclogged my eyelash duct right there in his office  Within a few short hours my pain was relieved and by the end of the night well on my way to healing  Thank you so much Dr  Woolf and staff!,positive,6466387
For some reason this Ghazale is the best one (out of all their locations) Although I wouldnt hesitate to visit any of their locations because the food is so good  soo cheap and the people who work it are always really nice This one on Bloor has a couple extras going for it  For starters they always load up their sandwiches with more stuff than the others  I usually get the grilled veggie pita  its filled with delicious fried eggplant and cauliflower that leaves me with cravings if I dont regularly get my fix  Also this one on Bloor also boasts a juice bar  oh and its open til also sorts of ungodly hours ,positive,1257720

This place has changed ownership and its disgusting now  Ive never knew pizza couldnt taste good  How could someone make pizza not taste good? The sauce is bland the cheese taste artificial  It was so horrible I use to love this place and the homemade lasagna now its more pricy and disgusting ,negative,5404811

These shelves where packed and brimming with an array of Asian goods   I saw a rather impressive offering of dried dates and this girl loves her dates  BTW dates are considered a health food I was only in the store for a short time and there was a huge selection  I ended up getting mango and cilantro and some wasabi peas  The cilantro was just $1 50 for a bunch  Mango was good too ,positive,5103354
We are back to this restaurant and it does not disappoint  It is consistently yummy We ordered a cup of New England clam chowder each and shared the friend seafood platter  I am from from the East coast and the New England clam chowder is the best outside of New England  I highly recommend this restaurant if you want good seafood ,positive,5944240
Anywhere I can bring my 4legged best bud is usually in my good graces!Throw in the fact that you can bring in your own food  hang out with friends and drink some locally crafted brews then you know youre in a super cool place aka Cold Garden!They had about 9 beers on tap  and at $5 a pint youre not having to dig deep into your pockets to try a bunch either! I enjoy sweet or citrusy beers so Cakeface (a vanilla bean based lager) was one I was excited to try  If youve ever wondered what its like to have dessert in a delish boozy form  this is it!It does get busy and seating is limited  They could improve the set up of their benches and flow of the bar so people arent climbing over each other to get up or clustered in weird places (hello random group of guys hovering awkwardly by the womens washroom)So grab your dog  some eats and head to Cold Garden already! What are you waiting for?,positive,326218
Zero!  I go there because its close   The food is old  cold and its rare to receive the correct food  When you bring it to their attention they get an attitude as if its your fault they screwed up  Never again,negative,6551803

Love the pizza here! I always stop and grab a slice of this New York style pizza  Its in the food court of the New York New York hotel  You get in line and they serve you cafeteria style and you get your drink and pay at the end  You cant sit in the restaurant itself  but there is plenty of seating in the food court  Come by and have a slice ,positive,3496945
Service Department is terrible  We have purchased multiple vehicles from this dealership and always been treated well on the sales side    however    We brought our Cadillac in for a check engine light and after paying a diagnosis fee were informed that gas tank would have to be dropped to repair a manufacturers defect at my cost  $2800!!! Took vehicle to a different shop where they smoke charged the system  found the problem and replaced fuel pump and accessory lines for $700  Shop showed me the defective part and informed me that there was no way that they properly checked vehicle and that any shop that missed this should be considered very suspect    Very disappointed and my loyalty as a customer (4 cars) is over   ,negative,4408185
We took our grandchildren here today and it was a wonderful experience   We spent a lot of time in the safe house which is designed for children   While they were playing with the equipment  they were also learning a lot about fire safety  I was amazed at the variety of fire equipment   I highly recommend it for families ,positive,6116376
I want to live off the salt air margarita  Its delicious and not to be missed  All Chicagoans are extremely spoiled with great Mexican food so the tacos here were not my favorite  however  the steamed buns and guac were delicious  Our server Terry was also worth a 5 star rating  Las Vegas houses some of the best service in the country and most are allstars but he really made us love our time there  I would definitely recommend this place if you need somewhere quick to stop before grabbing a later dinner or show in or near the Cosmo ,positive,2692933
I visited ND Nail for the first time today   I walked in & was able to get a pedi right away   Tina was my pedi tech & did a quick but efficient job  I was in & out within 45 min  The hot stone foot massage was great  I wish the calf massage was a little longer but overall it was a nice experience for $30 plus tip  Ill be back for sure ,positive,2681231
Ive always liked Shake Shack! This one is usually busy but still have great customer service!

I love that that do that!,positive,2966464
Ive played frisbee golf up here a couple times  The course is fun and challenging and I especially like the concrete tunnels that are on a couple of the holes  It is kind of difficult to find the discs sometimes if they land within the brush  The playground is actually pretty awesome too  Ive found myself stopping to explore them a few times  Big area in which dogs can run and play as well,positive,3071319
Showed up one evening for food to go and there wasnt a single employee in the building  One finally came from the patio and took my order  I asked for extra tzatziki  sauce for my gyro  I was given my food and checked to make sure my extra sauce made it in  there was no sauce at all  Again no employee anywhere    So I went into the kitchen and asked the chef for sauce to go  Food was ok  Service was horrible ,negative,4441512
The sandwich I have had was great (the Caprese)  My issue is with the terrible service and organization  It is a disorganized mess  They have three signs  To Order  To Pay and To Pickup  No one ever mans the To Order register  You pay at Pickup and pickup at to Pay  None of the staff tells you this  so Ive ended up in the To Pay line waiting for 10 minutes before realizing that I need to stand in the To Pickup line I dont know why they havent just taken the signs down  Its not like Im stupid either  every single other customer was also confused  After you get your order good luck finding a seat in the Palms food court ,negative,4989726

To be honest  I bought some of their rum at the Gilbert Farmers Market  Id eaten at the first one in Phoenix when they first opened and I liked it  Im thrilled they have one coming in Gilbert So on the recommendation of the guys selling the Rum in Gilbert  I had to try the newer menu that they have Since I was dashing around town  I kept it quick and tasty and had the Biscuits and Beer Gravy  It was just as good as Id imagined it would be  Creamy with lots of flavor  Id love the gravy on a chicken fried chicken breast or steak As I said  I cant wait till they open in Gilbert  If you can score a bottle of rum from the whiskey barrel  I highly suggest you grab it  Its the best of the Rum and Whiskey worlds together ,positive,5675052
Great location  we were lucky to have nice fountain views even from our indoor table  Service was five stars; attentive but not fussy  But the food  everything too heavily salted (and I LOVE salt)  sauced  and dressed  The gnocchi was like raw dough  the pappardelle overlooked to where just lifting the fork would break the noodles  also heavily sauced  Tuns tartare was an enormous portion  which was a pleasant surprise  but then turned out to extremely bland  unlike the rest of the dishes  I didnt want to bother eating more than a few bites because it just didnt bring anything to the party  Also had an overdressed salad Great breads were served with olive tapenade  which,neutral,1514835
Loved loved loved the fresh fish! Amazing good food and the sour dough bread bowl was to die for! Probably one of the better sour doughs Ive found in Phx  Its a little pricey but worth it in the end because the food is so good  The manager on hand was super friendly and accommodating he put the cherry on top for the all over good review because he made us feel welcomed ,positive,3544499

This location is new to me  but it looks like Julia cleared it up  I vaguely remember a Coldstone here  but more power to Yoforia for taking over   We came in on a Sunday after dinner (7ish) and the place was deserted   Most likely everyone was staying home  but seeing how it has been ridiculously hot for the past couple of days  I would figure this place to be hoppin Two girls were manning the station    didnt really welcome us (but instead were on their smart phones)   I dont mind it so much  but when it came down to check out     the girl made me wait about a minute before she looked up from her phone and didnt really say anything but  Is that it?  I almost feel like the payment process should be self served as well   The place seemed fairly clean    Im always impressed by their unique looking table and chairs (the spaceship/futuristic feel)   Toppings were well stocked and was what I expected from a Yoforia ,neutral,5372258
My expectation that Canadian items are more expensive than anything in New York City and New York State in general  for that matter  were met  However  this department store made me very comfortable  Everyone working was extremely friendly  apparently knowing that we were serious about shopping  I recommend going to the second floors housewares section  The clearance/sale section had so many steals that we bought a few things to drive back to New York City  Ironically  Canada Goose jackets in my wifes size were sold out and the employees here suggested that I go to Woodbury Commons! Haha ,positive,3682868
Been coming here for about 10 years now~ the staff has always been superb and friendly  and the food consistent  The prices are reasonable ~ I can go to Chilis and get two meals which would cost $50 for the two of us or dinner for two here at $27  Its healthy to the alternative as well! Not saying its the healthiest choice but you eat a lot of veggies and get your proteins in as well  I absolutely love it and hope it will be one of the long standing restaurants ,positive,463968
I found Bridwell about 1 yr ago as I was looking for a place that had good reviews  I have had a difficult time trusting auto mechanics  esp the dealers around here so when I found they had the BBB recommendation I was willing to try them out  I have had 2 rounds of work done on this car at Bridwell and both times the final cost was less than what the original estimate was  So far  so good  Great service always when I stop for gas as well  It is a relief to know that there is someone ready to help with my car even when I am just stopping for gas ,positive,2061744
I wish I could give this place 0 stars  The staff was SO rude and unprofessional  When I went to get my test  I tried to ask questions and make conversation with the nurse because I was nervous  She only gave me one word answers and seemed super irritated when I asked her about the procedure  When it came time for the test  she barked orders at me like I was in a prison  I only went to this Quest because it was closer to my house but I will NOT make this mistake again  I would rather drive 20mins out of my way and be seen by staff who know how to function socially than come across these people ever again ,negative,2847569
This place wont stop up selling you   They make me feel like a regular pedicure is not allowed and you have to get callus remover etc   Its not very relaxing   They say they accept credit cards but ask you to pay cash   The owner even asked me to use their ATM machine to make a cash withdrawl and pay a fee at the ATM so she could avoid the transaction fees when running my credit card   The pedicure is OK  but Im done with the place   I also got a manicure here a few months ago and my nail got infected   I had to get a tetanus shot and be on antibiotics to clear it up ,negative,5565283

Came here yesterday evening with my BF for dinner  I arrived about 5 mins before him (7:30pm) and there was a lineup of about 4 people  They have about 1520 tables and 2 servers who scurry around  Some days you get the cold shoulder and they dont answer you  other times they are faster  I ordered the pho with rare beef  cooked beef and tendon  a small isnt enough and I left feeling hungry  They use thin noodles in their pho and prices have increased  Broth wasnt overly salty but had quite a bit of flavour  Menuwise they have pho (including vegetarian broth)  other soup noodles  appetizers  rice dishes and specialty drinks  For two people  I paid $22 with tips  Bowls of pho range from 9 xx to 12 xxPersonally I dont think the value was there  Cash only,neutral,679689
Went back the other night and the entire menu had changed  The California/Mexican theme is no longer  and has now been replaced with hearty diner fare  done exceptionally  They now have a Chop section  where you can choose a pork chop  lamb chop or bonein New York strip  I had the apple braised Pork chop and it was bloody amazing  About an inch and a half thick  and perfectly cooked to medium  It came with pork fat roast potatoes and an appetizer plate of various pickled vegetables and garlic bread (sprinkled with parmesan  parsley and roasted garlic cloves)  Delicious We tried the Buttered Spaghetti with Meatballs and Red Sauce another night  which was also delicious  The profiteroles we had for dessert were also outstanding  They came with vanilla ice cream  and were drizzled with salted caramel and topped with roasted peanuts  Outstanding  Cant wait to try the rest of the new menu ,positive,6214018
Im not an Italian food fan  but I liked it  We came with a large party and the food was lavish  Service was great and it was like we were a part of their family  Service was personalized and I felt like thats the way a small family restaurant should be   The garlic knots  pizzas and lasagna were excellent  I would skip the seafood pasta next time  Just a little too fishy for my taste  Save room for zeppoles  these are amazing ,positive,2932865
I like this lounge especially the entire Aria  I have visited couple of times and bartenders seemed okay but patrons were rude  My first visit was better than my second  My overall assessments about Alibi in terms of music  drinks  their prices  bartenders and patrons stand at 85%which it is still encouraging  I will definitely return ,neutral,2354933
So upset  Went with a group of 8 and every single person had an amazing experience except for me  They called in a bunch of people who showed up out of nowhere to massage everyone  I must have had a very inexperienced person  My experience was the worst massage Ive ever had  Very gentle and weak  May as well have been a completely weak and inexperienced person ,negative,4524391
Pinch me  Ive entered pastry heaven I love croissants  I love matcha  I love custard filling  Lo and behold  Bake Code has a matcha croissant with a matcha custard filling  Talk about a nobrainer In addition to the Matcha croissant  we got a Matcha Tiramisu  a Thai Milk Tea croissant and an iced sea salt crema jasmine tea My favorite was definitely the croissants  Perfectly flaky on the outside and the custard filling was rich and creamy and full of flavor  I honestly cant wait to return to try their bajillion other pastries and baked goods While the prices are a little steep its not too bad considering how unique the items are  Also  I definitely recommend using the Ritual app if you want to avoid waiting in line or waiting in general I shall be returning to Pastry Paradise very soon ,positive,4200037
I am not a tea snob  but I wanted try try out a new green tea flavor I had hear of  sencha   Id had several green teas before loose leaf is my favorite  but its easier to find good blends in bags When I walked in  the place was bustling with Asians   How much more authentic could you get?  ^_^  Anyhow  I asked if they would make me a sencha and they had a sealed jar of looseleaf ready to go   In addition  I wondered if theyd be able to let me try another flavor of green tea sidebyside to compare   They brewed up two half cups of tea  and charged me for one Decent advice on which teas to try  and not a hint of snobbiness at my lack of tea knowledge   I had a really nice time   Thanks  STB!,positive,1867490

Brandon is the man! He comes on a regular schedule  priced right  leaves a detailed report and does a great job! Last year  before I used them  we had company with young boys who loved killing scorpions by my citrus trees  This year they went out and found 1  Just one!!

This is probably the greatest buffet in Las Vegas   All of the food is top quality   the question is Is it $20 better than the Wicked Spoon or the Wynn buffet?  The oysters on the half shell are the freshest large sized oysters one can imagine   They serve really great prime rib with the ribs which was like butter and totally delish   While the sushi section is limited  the quality and freshness of the fish was on point   I think it is worth the extra $ because this buffet has the greatest variety of cuisines (9 different stations) and  unusual top shelf dishes   There really isnt much to add to the other reviews ,positive,5322529
Five stars Auto yes this is a fivestar place they had Mastered hamburgers I saw on the menu a peanut butter and jelly bacon cheeseburger I asked the waitress how is it youll be surprised I ordered it tried it I loved it  I cant stop thinking about this cheeseburger it was so good so filling and I had to take half of it home Happy Hour Friday were going to be there ,positive,1188623

This place is small  but packed to the top with a lot of great finds  I wish Id had more time to play in there  The more I looked the more I found that I loved  TONS & tons of vintage & antique costume jewelry with rhinestones & thousands of necklaces  brooches  earrings  bracelets    Victorian  Deco  50s  crystal  gilt  glass    So many beautiful pieces  The prices on almost everything I wanted was a little higher that I would pay because I repurpose stuff  but she did say shed give 30% off many things over $20  or maybe that was under $20 if cash or check was used  She has it all organized  however so many boxes are stacked on top of the other  so if you dont see it  ask Christy  shell go right to what your looking for!! Im hoping to go back sometime soon  but I live in Raleigh & was visiting Charlotte this weekend  she really had SO MANY great pieces  oh  make sure you look in the back & open drawers  lots of hidden treasures!,positive,5506885
Awesome Hummus  I come here for my teas  vitamins  local honey (horrible allergies)  and random items I need at the time  like aluminum foil (they have 100% recycled!)

I love this place and so does my Yorkie!  I used to go to Petco but they charge $70 just to groom my 9 lb yorkie   The prices here are so reasonable that Ive been taking my dog in more often   He loves the open area and gets to play with other dogs while waiting   I would highly recommend this place for grooming & daycare/overnight stays   I never took my dog to any boarding places before because I didnt want him locked up the whole time but at Nathalies he gets to run around all day long with other dogs   Nathalie & her staff takes care of the dogs like its her own   I dont have to feel guilty or worry about a thing when Im away for the weekend ,positive,2433735

I have noticed there is a trending issue when it comes to this company being able to accurately file dental claims for reimbursement  I guess even showing a benefits card that clearly shows its dental coverage and emailing explicit directions on how to file a claim isnt enough  I suggest filing your own dental claims before you get sent to collections      and their poor attempt to reach you to resolve is by a 3rd party who never leaves messages so if your anything like me and dont answer calls from unknown numbers and dont get a voicemail make sure you monitor your mail very closely because next thing you know     collections  Honestly other than the office staff the hygienist have always been great  hopefully some of them will move on ,negative,2269281
Let me start off by saying that I love this place! Great local food at an even better price! I cant get enough of it   everytime Im in Vegas I go here  They have a really good selection to choose from  They have all the local favorites  The only draw back is that this place can get supwr busy at peak times and it might take awhile to get your food  But that is because this place has delicious food I am definitely a fan of this place and would recommend it to anyone!,positive,3418435

Had chicken roti wrap from here twice and it tasted pretty good  but found a strand of hair in it both times  Wish they were more careful when making food  The food itself tasted pretty good  until of course I saw the hair and had to throw it all out  Until I have a better experience at this place  I can only give it 2 stars  based on the fact that I found hair every time Ive had food from there At least if it was once  I understand  mistakes happen  But twice doesnt seem like a mistake Tastewise though  its a pretty nice restaurant ,negative,1648913
Love staying at different Westin hotels  Usually it never disappoints  But this time around  I was a little disappointed with the room  I expected the room to be clean  but it wasnt  I saw red hair locks on the rim of the toilet bowl  I have black hair  so that it pretty disgusting  Good thing I keep sanitizer wipe in my luggage  so I used it to disinfect the rim  The bathroom was a dirty with black stuff on the floor  Had to put towels on the floor so I can walk around  The room was dusty  The bedsheets were very rough  It was scrapping our skin  The lobby was nice and clean  very different from the room we had ,negative,3485317

Its not the greatest supermarket  In all the times Ive been there  the cleanliness hasnt been the greatest  The last time I went  the roof was leaking and there was puddles everywhere  I havent been back since and Im hoping they fixed that problem  They dont seem to be on top of the whole being in stock thing which is the reason you want to go to a market  right? Being Asian  Ive managed to get a feel of most  if not all  of the Asian market chains within the city and by far  this is one of the worst locations Ive been to  Maybe the Scarborough location is different  But the Etobicoke location? It doesnt quite cut it  Ive also heard/seen that some of the products are overpriced so I wouldnt go for it  in particular the Polish foodstuffs  Its my last resort in terms of going to for any type of Asian food ,negative,3272698

Came in here for the Jerk Chicken lunch special $4 99tax got me a giant piece of delicious  moist  flavorful jerk chicken  a giant pile of beans & rice (make sure to get the curry sauce from the curry chicken ladled over the rice  its so good)  2 fried plaintain pieces  a big scoop of coleslaw  and a piece of fried dough (forget what thats called) It was enough food for 2 people  seriously I couldnt finish half of it  Really good overall It was quick and tasty and filling  And CHEAP Just a note they take cash only  so if you only have visa/debit like I do  you have to get the receipt and go to the restaurant upstairs to pay with their debit (owned by same people)  Not a huge deal ,positive,684796
This was definitely one of the better breakfast spots Ive been to in Arizona  The decor was like country sheik and the wait staff was very friendly and attentive Both times Ive ordered the veggie omelet and was happy to see they used fresh spinach and other fresh vegetables  It was very tasty  Most importantly (for me) nothing was super greasy  The wait time to be seated can be a bit much if youre totally starving  Id go back on a very early weekend morning or a weekday to avoid the masses ,positive,5623439
So the Showmars in the Charlotte Plaza building (aka Charlotte School of Law building) is back open for business after a remodel   Its super bright and modern looking with a different set up    the ordering counter is up front and you can get your food to go or dinein   If you dinein  you get a number and your food is brought out to you promptly Theres a round kiosk station in the center of the floor that has the drink machine  condiments  utensils     etc   The dining area is pushed to the back  next to the windows   You can eat and look over the plaza fountain and also see the clock fountain across the street at Wells One   Theres a mix of booths and tables  so you can combine tables if you have a large group or so Servers are super nice and they even clean up after you when you finish dining     Definitely a good option for breakfast and lunch if you work uptown  needing something quick and casual ,positive,4518842
My wife and I went here for dinner hoping to find another acceptable choice for dinner in the area  We were really disappointed   After a nice dinner salad with a good strawberry vinegarette dressing  the meal went totally downhill   I had the Sirloin Di Pizzaiola which had a strange texture and was very very chewy   It was hard to even get my fork into it and a real chore to cut it with the provided steak knife   It was bland and lacking in any real taste   My wife had the Chicken Parmigiana   The breading on the chicken had a bad taste and combined with the sauce to make a strange paste   The spaghetti with pomodoro sauce that came on the side was average at best The service was also below par as our waiter also doubled as the bartender and it took quite a while for him to process our payment   All in all a very unpleasant experience ,negative,3834114
Before my absolute favorite store was Rainbow for clothes  But now I prefer to go here  Its really a hit or miss to shop here  Its either you come out with a couple of some nice stuff or bustling around racks and get one item ,positive,489237
I give two stars for the juice selection and juice selection only! The guys that work there think they are rip trippers or something and look at you dumbfounded when you ask something  And Ive been vaping for over 3 years so Im not new to this  There was a really hot girl that worked there  but havent seen her lately so I figured the vape gods got mad she was taking all the attention  They need to take a drive over to aqualung and see what real customer service is  Wont be back unless Im truly in a bind ,negative,2079365
I took my car to this location for the first time and the guy at the counter was not friendly and had a very sharp and nasty attitude  When called by a different guy to pick up my car  he too was  also very Rude not mention had no mannerismn for calling my name incorrectly  I got my paperwork and went out the door  there was NO thank you  have a nice day  Kiss my TUSH nothing  Little do they know I DO know the owner  and have been with him and my entire family for YEARS  So when I see Jim  I WILL mention this to him in HOW I was treated  but I will NO LONGER Return to this Location EVER  I would rather stand in the Nude in the State of Alaska and feel the Real chill there then the Chill in a Mechanic shop where I am BRINGING YOU my money  my business  my cars( as I have 3) ,negative,2640346
Hey well I called in my order and they didnt start it until everyone in line was taken care of once I got there  Whats the point again of calling ahead!??,negative,1734721
This chain was recommended by a dear friend who thought I would enjoy the family style Italian eatery    This chain is no longer in my area  so I cant readily visit  On my first visit  I had a small classic spaghetti and 2 huge meatballs  The sauce was fresh and tasty  The house bread with olive oil and a fabulous Italian seasoning blend was delicious  I could have eaten my fill of the bread and amenities   I completed my meal with tiramisu  which was just ok  My server was friendly and attentive and the manager stopped by the table and wanted to know how I found myself there on my trip and thanked me for my patronage and looked forward to seeing my on a subsequent visit    I had doggie bags and made additional meals out of this family sized serving ,positive,5171649
While the atmosphere is nice and the decor is comprised of stuff Id like to see in my own home  the food is greatly over rated (and over priced) here  The enchiladas were subpar and the tacos were the worst Id ever had according to my boyfriends review of the pork tacos (and hes a man who knows his pork tacos)  For about $17 (including tip) you can get one margarita (Ive had better) and somewhat crappy Mexican food  Ouch  I will say their appetizer size spare rib Chile taquitos were alright  but they were not a full meal nor were they worth the nine dollars we spent on them  Wonderful  attentive service though so bravo to the staff!,negative,6384205
This review is for Parasol Down only  Parasol Up looks terrible  But Parasol down is one of the my favorite things to do in Las Vegas  Sit outside on the patio  pay slightly too much for quality drinks (they poured a mean Old Fashioned for $12 50)  Watch the water  the creepy Art Nouveauwannabe light show (or a singing animatronic frog    seriously)  Its an awesome place for a cold drink on a warm Vegas night ,positive,5583540
Second time here and the food never disappoints! Know that you dont go here for the romantic atmosphere or the amazing service (which was fine  just didnt blow us away ) You go for the food which makes the drive all the way from downtown Toronto worth it  The dumplings and stews are to die for  yes this is the one place you HAVE to order the cold eggplant dish  and it wouldnt be a meal without the boat shaped bread with egg and cheese  Take me back!,positive,4394283
This wasnt our first time at The Sharp Edge  we had been here probably about 1 1/22 years ago and we remember liking it then  This time? Not so much  in fact we probably wont be going back and definitely wont be recommending the place to our friends  The food is overpriced  the service borders on nonexistent and the food is barely mediocre  My house salad was a small bowl of lettuce  3 marinated baby carrots  2 beet slices  3 grape tomatoes  a peperoncini and onions and was priced at $5 50  Plus there was a hair in it! YUM! Ill never understand why they dont leave the plate in question somewhere in plain view until the new dish is brought in  I cant help but think she just took it in the back and plucked the hair of the dish and brought it back to me  Needless to say I barely ate the salad  Hamburgers ran around $11 00  Youre better off driving a few blocks further to BRGR ,negative,5658161
Arrivied @ Wolfgang for lunch after arriving at MGM Grand   We both ordered the same Fried Chicken Sandwich w/lots of fries  diet coke & sprite    Both sandwiches were cooked nice and fries excellent   Server was very efficient and wait assistant was the same in regards to water & soda refills ,positive,335233
We purchased a blue male that was from a rescue litter from Bliss  He has been nothing short of an amazing addition to our family! Great experience with Bliss during the adoption process and when we thought we had an issue I had text her in the middle of the night and she called us right away  We had originally named our little guy Tex but after getting to know him he is now Trump  he has a great personality and demands and takes the rooms attention! He is gorgeous and we are so lucky to have him! Being our second French baby this year we are taking a short break but hope to purchase another female from Bliss by Christmas! Thank you Bliss for allowing us to add this amazing Frenchie to our family,positive,6089896

Being from the east coast  I expect my pasta to be homemade and the mozzarella to be fresh   Not at Noras! Food is average at best! On par with Maggianos or Brios  The only reason I gave it three stars was for the bar ,neutral,494314
For the man (employee) with the temporary beard   I saw him walking down the aisle  he had not yet settled in to work and his masterpiece tie knot was awaiting creation  He asked if i was finding everything alright  I let him know I was on a quest for Colorado craft beers  He swiftly grabbed a printed list and went on a search  Not just a here ya go  No  he hunted for an articulated choice assortment of craft beers one of each style and from different breweries  With his knowledge & beer tasting experience I now have a pretty rad gift to give  Thank you kind sir  Until next time ,positive,1260332
Went to RC in Harrahs last night with a wedding party of 8  Had looked at the menu online before going only to find that they had NONE of the specials advertised online available! None  zip  zilch! Then after several of the guests ordered the porterhouse for two ($105) the server knocks over a guests glass of wine and spills it into the porterhouse of another guest  I find out after the dinner that the kitchen only replated the meat leaving it wine soaked  I was shocked to see this level of really awful service at a Ruth Chris and hope it is not just what they have come to  Ive eaten at RC in many cities around the US and have always thought they had the best steak around but Ive got to say that even setting aside the bad service the filet I bought was just soso  Afraid its just not the RC of yesteryear ,negative,6277258
If youre looking for a dependable and high quality dry cleaners than look no further  Ive been a customer for a little while now and have been happy with their work  Theres no doubt that Id highly recommend American Dry Cleaners to anyone as they have been extremely consistent with their work  5 stars without question ,positive,3156875
Hands down the best motorcycle mechanic Ive had the pleasure of doing business with  Needed quite a few things repaired on my custom bobber (custom machining to repair my faux oil tank that broke off the frame mounts from vibration  electrical work  carb cleaning and tuning  mounting my monster craftsman chain tensioner  the list goes on) Grumpy took care of everything I needed and the bike came back running as strong as ever  Price was very reasonable in light of the amount of work performed  Whether you need a mechanic to work on your bike or want to rent a lift to do the work yourself  this is your shop  Rode all the way from Lake Las Vegas to find a trustworthy and skilled mechanic and Ill be going back ,positive,1684938

Les Halles DAnjou is a little mall where you can easily find everything you need to satisfy even the most discerning palates   It isnt far from my office so I often stop here after work if I need to pick up something for dinner or entertaining   Most of the stores here are foodrelated though there is a Dollarama and Archambault   In terms of food they have it all: a bakery  a cheese shop  a pasta shop  butcher  fishmonger and a SAQ   In the warmer months you can find a great little outdoor farmers market   When its too cold for the farmers market you can choose to go to Fruiterie 440 instead   The food court here is your typical mall food court in that it is mostly chains but I rarely eat there   If youre in Anjou Les Halles is well worth the visit   It is kind of far from the metro so if youre coming here youre best off driving   Being out in the suburbs there is always an abundance of parking ,positive,3409178
Im giving 3 stars only because I cant split them! Id rather only give 2 5 stars  I had the chipotle pork meatballs and they were wonderful! I was there during lunch and the service was terrible! In my opinion  service and food are equal  Bad service is enough to keep me away from great food  If you dont mind waiting  confused servers  and more waiting  go for the food!,neutral,2916411

Fantastic find  When you walk in the front door the butcher case greets you  That set the bar pretty high as everything in the case looked great  We were seated promptly by the gentleman who came from behind the case  Our waitress Bonita and waitress in training Carli were not only friendly but informative  We had quite a few questions  as we usually do and the staff didnt mind at all  I wanted a burger that wasnt on the menu  Not a problem  I got exactly what I wanted done to a perfect medium  We had the eggrolls for an appetizer  they were ridiculously good  By the time we left at about 12:45 the line was out the door  Its no wonder  if I lived nearby Id be a regular in no time  Oh and dont miss the duck fat fries ,positive,1090087

NO ability to rate but yelp forces a star so heres 1   A large group of our family MADE RESERVATIONS for dinner next week several months ago  We were eagerly anticipating our evening together at a great new Cleveland venue when we received a SHOCKING call telling us that they have decided NOT to take reservations NOR to honor those they had already made! They said it would be first come first served  which is ridiculous for a group this size on a Friday night  Most of us have worked in hospitality in the past and are therefore pretty forgiving and generous  This  however  is just terrible customer service  Fortunately we were able to get reservations at a longtime favorite so we will have our party  but this is JUST BAD SERVICE! Hope this place gets it together   in spite of a perfect location  they cant insult Clevelanders for long and hope to survive ,negative,3844348

Pancake House is the perfect casual weekend breakfast location  Go early to avoid waiting for a table  Everyone is so friendly and they make sure your coffee cup is always full  I always order the oven baked omelet which is enormous and delicious! Good price for the portion of food  Must pay with cash or check  If you only have plastic  they have an ATM machine inside  Yum!,positive,4174347
Yuck!! So disappointed   The free egg roll and the crab Rangoon with no crab in it was the best part  We ordered a lot and it was not expensive  but definitely will not be going back again ,negative,6537192
Overrated!! Honestly the (actual) hot dog tasted regular  nothing special   the buns were regular  nothing special   they just threw a bunch of sides on top of a REGULAR hot dog!! At $67a hot dog  presentation is only a fraction of what i expected Dont get me wrong  would i eat here again??   probably   could it be better?? YES,negative,4165720
Polo is awesome! His rates are very reasonable and he always does a phenomenal job  Hes a great guy and always hooks me up even when I dont have any appointment or if I get there 10 minutes before closing time  The other barbers in his shop are really good too and know their stuff very well  His shop is always clean and organized  Ive been going here for haircuts for about 2 years now and Ive always come out happy and satisfied  Definitely better than going to those chain salons where they dont really care about you and do an average job for a higher price  Try out Polos shop and you wont be disappointed!,positive,4220506
Had takeout on new Years day   one of the few places opened!!!

Good value and a reasonable amount of selection   Not the biggest menu but enough of the favorites to cover most tastes   The party platters are a favorite   It looks like thats the only way to get special rolls to go   Dont think there is a place with better value   Rolls are pretty big and the Sashimi  is cut pretty thick    not like others that slice thin or have a tiny cross section   If they keep this formula up Ill definitely keep ordering from here   IT wont be the best sushi you have ever had but thats not what they are trying to be    they are a go to place that you can hit a couple times a week and it wont break the bank ,positive,1384866
First time I had Chicago style deep dish   I think Ill stick with thin NY style I got a small pepperoni to go   It basically tasted like a hunk of cheese strings with bread and a touch of sauce I dont think it was cooked quite enough   It had very little sauce with only 2 pepperonis on each slice What makes thin NY style better is the even distribution (typically) of ingredients    Chicago deep dish  at least at this place is all cheese with barely any tomato sauce   Very disappointed and will never waste my money here again ,negative,1147391
Little flies buzzing around  Not a good sign  Food is mostly pre made   Ill pass this one from now on,negative,3439158
Although we live just around the corner  we had yet to try The Secret Chocolatier  So glad we did! It was a rainy Saturday and a mini chocolate craving crept up    so I went on Yelp and ended up stopping in  We selected milk chocolate caramels  espresso truffle  cardamon truffle  dark chocolate dipped smore on a stick  and grabbed one of the many chocolate bars on the retail end  ( not in the case)So glad we eventually gave in to the craving!,positive,243275
Warranty is crap  After a few months they voided the warranty  DO NOT BUY FROM HERE  Another way they get you is to have you come in when you do decide to get your car fixed is they break something else while they have it  ALL 3 TIMES I TOOK MY CAR IN EVEN FOR SOMETHING AS A SIMPLE OIL CHANGE THEY BROKE SOMETHING NOT EVEN RELATED  Today they managed to break my starter which NEVERRRRRRRRRRR HAD AN ISSUE until the ONE DAY I TAKE IT BACK IN TO THEM  They then proceeded to try and charge us 100 for a new starter  They can fix what they broke or I will continue to write negative reviews at every opportunity and on every social media outlet I can reach ,negative,5910190
Just wanted to leave another review for this place   I am never disappointed !    Such good food!!!!!! Tonight we had the bangers and mash  and fish and chips    I am beyond happy!  So delicious !  Best happy hour and food in Vegas by far and Ive lived here nearly 3 years ,positive,3357661
Great little place off hwy 20 on the way back from Quebec to Toronto   No frills kind of place that focus in the food   Servers are friendly  food is dependably delicious and menu has smoked meat  ribs   chicken and there take out is great   Second time weve had a chance to stop and making it a regular part if the drive back routine   Ribs were surprisingly teriyaki tasting but very tender   Not fall of the bone  but the way they are supposed to be  tender but still with some pull back ,positive,1507850
Used this company for my new house on the recommendation of my realtor  The owner Tom Atkinson showed up the day after I called him  provided us the options and pricing for both a water softener system and reverse osmosis system for drinking water  fully explained the alternatives  and was low pressure  We decided to buy right away because hes been in business for more than 30 years and comes across as honest and trustworthy  We did not shop around because his pricing seemed reasonable  The installer Angel came when scheduled  seemed very capable  left our house as clean as he found it and thoroughly explained the operation of both systems  Based on our initiative experience I recommend these folks ,positive,5782906
im not a fan of chain restauanants but i had heard good things about kona so i decided to try it   nothing is great and nothing is horrid   the food is edible but overpriced   the drinks are fine but they come with a little too much flair from the bartender for me   i just find the place silly   its a chain restaurant in a strip mall and the servers act as if they are curing cancer   its good for a laugh but nothing more ,negative,6598801

The Golden Nugget will officially be my preferred hotel when I return to Vegas  The room was very nice and clean  The Grille was really good  The pool was amazing  Everything I experienced was fantastic  I dont care about drinking or gambling so this place was perfect  Mere minutes from Fremont st was also great since I had a concert at the LVCS  I love the Golden Nugget and will be a Fan for life ,positive,4738057

Fun!I was here for a birthday party and the kids all had so much fun  There were crafts and activities  the kids were really engaged throughout the entire party  There was a SpiderMan character  face painting and tattoos  and a lot of really fun games  The kids asked if we could go back to play There is a lot of space inside  which really surprised me when I saw the store front  There is a nice pink area in the front with a lot of toys and even some dresses and capes for the kids to dress up in  The room our party was in had a really cool jungle mural all over the wall and a jungle gym for the kids to play on  I didnt see too much of the other room  but I caught a glimpse of a bouncy castle! The staff were really up beat and friendly too  I would recommend this place for all kids parties  I liked it  but more importantly  the kids at the party had a really great time  and are still talking about the party  Its creative and fun and really gets the kids involved  Great place!,positive,1309830

Just an okay place  with just some ok food & some bad food   Avoid the meatball sub which is terrible too much bread  salty sauce and not enough meatballs   Their pear salad is pretty good but not for $12 00   Their pizza is just okay nothing to write home about   Overpriced food and bad wait staff not a good fit for a restaurant   There are much better options for great Pizza in town  like across the street by the gas station ,negative,3320108

An elegant restaurant meets late night  place doesnt close till 6am   but I came here for dinner with the bros  since we forgot to make reservations at sw  I ordered the Risotto Pescatora which comes with shrimp  scallops  calamari  mussels  clams  It was sweet  risotto was cooked nicely  it was like mushy  but not to the point of poridge  but this was my first time having risotto  so not sure on how it should taste ha   none of the seafood was overcooked  Tried some of my friends Biaca pizza  which had prosciutto  arugula  and cheese  I am a sucker for prosciutto  and it was pretty good  great sized pizza that you could share with two ,positive,307687
Not anywhere near as good as my first time here 3 months ago   order was brought out incorrectly  food was lukewarm  and service was slow and there was a lack of communication with our server   big disappointment this time   Two stars for Sangria Margaritas and the Mariachi Band which plays every Friday night   the highlight of the dinner for sure!,negative,3922466
Kiku Sushi is an amazing place  Not only is their sushi good but you can order fresh sushi if you dont like whats on the conveyer belt  I have extreme social anxiety but this place makes me feel comfortable which is saying a lot  When I have a bad day  this is where I go to cheer up ,positive,3370893
When there a Thursday like all good businesses in Quebec the owner of the restaurant wants to keep the staff to a minimum to save money but when your restaurant is full and you have no service and a quarter of the tables are dirty with nobody cleaning them and no client sitting at them I dont think this is a good way to conduct business and on top of it the roof started to leak we had to leave,negative,6360507

Ive been a smoker for almost 20 years  Tried everything from gum to chantix  I even tried different kinds of e cigs  but was never satisfied  I figured i would give e cigs another shot since they have gotten a lot better over the years  I checked this place out and was very impressed  The guys here are very knowledgeable  They have the best e juice i have ever tasted  Thanks to these guys I have not picked up a single cigarette in over 6 months  which is a huge accomplishment for me  Thank you to Synergy Vapor Labs for literally saving my life,positive,3289104
Taking your car to a shop is never a pleasant experience when you know you have a problem  For me I am not well versed in the world of auto repair and that is sometimes when shops take advantage of uneducated vehicle owners such as myself  I was told by another shop that I need to replace my water pump  I had an uneasy feeling from the other shop and was referred by a friend to Big Bs  I am so thankful I decided to come here  From the phone call to get my car in for diagnostics  to the day I got my car back I was 100 % comfortable with having the work done here  It was comforting to know the repairs recommended were necessary and not made using scare tactics   but with a genuine concern for the safety of my vehicle and the passengers it carries   Undeniable honesty  thorough inspection  and trustworthy  will be the reasons I bring my vehicle here from now on  Thank you for the kindness and going the extra mile ,positive,4680640
Lunch buffet runs until 3  We got here at 2 and there was still an ample amount of food in the trays  The naan was fresh and fluffy  The wait staff was very attentive and polite  One of the better lunch buffets Ive been to ,positive,3560246
Food was cold and 100% microwaved  Service was meh at best  Ordered a drink and it came with aristocrat (took one sip) so I asked for titos  Ended up being charged for both because it wasnt her fault  Will never come back or recommend anyone to  Side note: it smelled weird  probably due to poor ventilation ,negative,1222501
Not worth it!!! Went for Fathers Day  was told it would be a 30 minute wait and ended up waiting over an hour and a half  Meanwhile I watched over 30 bays remain empty the entire time I was there  R u kidding me  They really need to figure out what they r doing ,negative,3954699
Not the quality of service that had in the past  My wife ordered the chicken parmigiana with linguini  The pasta came and it was brown  We asked the waitress and she was   well confused  The manager came over to say that they are taking linguini off the menu and are using up what it left so they have her wheat linguini  He admitted they should have told us  but the damage was done  Offered her a dish of regular pasta but took so long the rest of us were done and they had given us the check  Why bring the check before the food is out and not compensate for the intentional mistake  Also we had asked for extra sauce for one of our kids meals  but that never arrived  I would like to say the waitress was new  but the receipt reflects the correct details for our order  so I hope the kitchen gets this review and pays more attention to future orders ,negative,3950791

Not sure why  but I just dont really enjoy doing grocery shopping here  I mean  it has a good selection of products  and each department is a decent size  but Id personally prefer to shop somewhere else  It is really conveniently placed as its pretty much right next to the subway  and it has 2 entrances  What I dislike is the fact that they dont give students a discount  but if you just go upstairs to the sobeys  they offer students a 10% discount,negative,3947128
I was hoping for amazing sushi at this really nice hotel but the rolls were just ehhh okay  I get way better sushi at the hole in the wall down the street from my house in Cali  I guess we were expecting more at any of the restaurants in this hotel but should have gone with the Yelp reviews  The restaurant was very open and didnt give you that cozy atmosphere we were looking for for a Friday evening dinner  Everywhere we went for dinner at Aria the staff handed out/used these Ipads to show off their drinks/dessert menu but although it looks cool it didnt really serve a real purpose  It would have been great that instead of waiting around for our waiter to order another drink   that we could order off their Ipads and have it delivered to our table ,negative,2727394

We discovered this place when they were at Taco Fest  and finally tried them out tonight  Sat on the amazing back patio      you order your food and drinks at the bar  and they are served to your table  Love the bar in a shipping container  and the real food truck doing the food prep! For inside they have a real kitchen  I think    I think we passed it on our way through       Food was AWESOME  Taco night  so discounted  Great taste combinations  Fabulous pitcher of margaritas  Only comment      so     no one is taking out orders and watching our needs  yet at the bar  the tipping options on the machine START at 20%? Ummm                 A little cheeky :P,positive,5987252
Been here twice over the past six months   I love the space   The second floor  aka the main dining room  has an open kitchen  high ceilings  rustic/industrial interior   Its a really nice place to have dinner   Great vibe Sadly  I cant rave about the pizza in the same way   I like the crust and most toppings  but I find the pizza slightly underdone   The centre of the pie is always soggy  making it hard to eat   I wish they could bake it a tad longer so it would crisp up a bit more   Its not true Neopolitan pizza as Ive had the chance to enjoy recently in Naples   That being said  I really enjoyed the diavolo  even though it was soggy   On the flip side  they have a pizza with only sausage and rapini: no cheese  no sauce   Its weird   I do not recommend it   I will say the prix fixe is a pretty good deal   For $25  you get a basic appetizer  a pizza and a dessert   You can pick from 34 appies and desserts and any of the pizza   Good for a easy date! :),neutral,478187

The store is rather small but every space is stocked and kept neat and clean    The staff have always been courteous and helpful   Sometimes they are out of a specific size bottle of a developer that I need for my hair color   When they were out recently  it took over two weeks before it was in stock!  Its a standard activator so I dont understand why it took so long to get the product in   If you qualify for a free Pro Preferred Member card  even better deals await you!  The store is small and if there are even several people in the store it makes navigating the aisles as well as getting in/out of the entrance door challenging ,positive,5026408
Holy cow   If you have read my other reviews on yelp or trip advisor  you would be confused as to why I am giving Red Dragon such a bad review   I probably spent like $2000 dollars there over the last 7 years That being said  I order food at 5:40 pm on Sunday night   They told me it would be 45 minutes   At 1 hour and 15 minutes I called and they said that the food was on the way   At 1 hour and 35 minutes we called back and asked about the problem   The manager hung up on us    We ordered PITA JUNGLE after that   We then called back just to see what they would say   They offered 20% off   Really?  Save your dumb pennies and give me better service ,negative,1751739

Worst possible experience ever at a ChickfilA  From the time we walked through the door the experience was horrible    started with an impatient cashier and progressed to open condiment packages in the self serve bin  By the time  we noticed that the packets were open  there was ketchup all over my hands and legs and the chairs  One of the other workers did come out and cleaned up the mess  When I attempted to use the bathroom to wash the mess off of my hands  I discovered that a code is required to open the bathroom door  Asked at the front counter for assistance  I was told to look for the code on the receipt  rather than assisting me   To top it off  after all the clean up our food was cold and the drink order was wrongLast time I ever set foot in a ChickfilA!!!  Too bad that you cant give zero stars as a rating   So much for Christian compassion 04/13/20168:20pmOrder# 3501057,negative,6444919
Oarcadia farms What can i say Fantastic food and wonderful serviceEverything is freshly made and fantastic pastriesService is spot on  Very personable  and quick to arriveThey are always willing to customize things for you They food was very flavorable and the drinks were nice and lightMy girlfriend and i both had the grilled salmon The salmons were grilled mediumrare The salads had a light lemon terragon dressing  with panfried potatoesThe desserts where fantastic not overly sweet   very moist and the cake was not dry you can not beat the 8 dollar priceThank you for a memorable girls day   i can hardly wait to share this special place with others,positive,3968825

Tacos were Excellent!! My wife and drove from Surprise craving carne asada  lengua  and cabeza tacos  Im a very  very picky person when it comes to tacos  These tacos hit the spot!!! Be sure you like your tacos a little spicy before asking for everything on your tacos     little bit of a kick on their chile  It was very busy but we sat down in less than 3 minutes and our server attended us right away  I would highly recommend this taco stand; you will not be disappointed  By the way  you can bring your own drinks,positive,4678378
Service was cool  Didnt have to wait at all got a table  If you want to get in and out before the crowd I suggest come early  I had a burger and Moscow Mule they were not shy on the liquor in my drink  The waitress was nice and other waitresses would check in as they walked by unlike my location back home ,positive,4418700
Was looking forward to trying Squid Ink  particularly because their happy hour food menu is pretty substantial  Was so disappointed    everything was the okay version of what it could have been  Potstickers were fine  miso cod wasnt seared or served hot enough  Sushi was just very lackluster  Our meal was $72 and felt like it should have been no more than $50 with the quality of the fish ,negative,5922435
We have enjoyed Phoenix Ale House several times  This new brew spot has a great look  Its a little confusing from the road with the boarded up windows  however they are in the back of this building along with another restaurant  Totally worth the find The beer selection is great  Lots to choose from    cant make up your mind  No problem  They have beer flights  The service is the only reason for the 4 stars  Out of the 2 times weve visited  Its seems they have a rotating server  Always someone different coming by  Im not a fan of this because it can cause issues and delays  Which happened on visit 2  Maybe they just are working out the bugs of being new The food was excellent   We will come back again,positive,6044992
Staff not really welcoming  Took forever to get our drinks (more than 20 min!!!)  Food was also served quite a while after ordering it  Will definitely not recommend the place  ,negative,4572488
The sushi is descent  the hot green tea is excellent  the price is right  and they have good service  I like to order a few things that are not available in the conveyor belt; the Uni was good 4 out of 5 times  I would like to say this is a great place for a quick bite since the sushi is ready when you arrive but the reality is that the place is always packed and theres usually a 30 minute wait for dinner if you are not alone  However  if you are by yourself  then you can usually be sat right away or with a minimum wait time ,neutral,5028959
Eh    He seems very conceited to me and without much to back it up  The show was more about him than his talent  If I had rated this when I saw it (a year and a half ago)  I probably would have given it 3 stars and chalked it up to not being interested in magic shows  But after seeing Penn and Teller (which I gave a 4 star rating) a few months ago  I realized I DO like magic   I just dont like David Copperfield  The only pluses for me were that it was in the MGM Grand where I was staying and my boyfriend got to go up on stage as a volunteer ,negative,977716
Thank you Tempo for offering a meatless and dairyfree option on your lunch menu! I had the quinoa thai wrap which was wonderful and my boyfriend had the fish tacos  which he also enjoyed  Amount of french fries that came with the lunch was a bit enormous  but they were delicious so i cant complain  :o) I would give this place 5 stars if they also offered something I could eat at dinnertime  but last i checked there is still nothing on the dinner menu that is vegan  which is a major bummer   I will say that service here was fantastic  actual trained waitstaff as opposed to amateur high school kids that the previous establishment employed  We are happy you are here Tempo!,positive,4710851
This was our second summer with LD Vinci & their Summer Day Camp   We LOVE the variety of fine arts that are introduced to the kiddos   especially painting!  Both of my kiddos loved the painting portion the most but having Music Theater & Hip Hop were welcome breaks into the long days of summer!  The staff has ALWAYS been very welcoming and friendly [SO appreciated!]  Also  I appreciate their concern for the safety & security of the kids while they are in LD Vincis care [front door is ALWAYS locked from the outside to keep wanderers from wandering in] and the amount of activities for the value is great!  Thank you!!!,positive,5647409

Busy on weekends with ppl of all ages and ethnic groups  Kid friendly  Pricey rides  kettle corn  food  and store products  The hot and canned foods are delish  and the apples  peaches are awesome everytime  The kids enjoy the rides and bouncy patch   2yr olds are free to enjoy all! The tractor ride tour of the grounds is rather lame but is an opportunity to sit and take a short ride to the pumpkin patch  Music may be provided during the weekend afternoons  which is nice   3 5 stars ,neutral,609832

With Ra Next door  I think this is restaurant alley   Bandera came as a recommendation and the prices were not too bad   25 for some pretty good prime rib isnt too bad especially when you can expense it   The wait time was about 10 minutes  but I can really see how this place can be super crowded on weekends   I didnt try the chicken  but the other 3 folks who ordered it enjoyed it ,positive,6408383
This place is a new business and that is finally getting all the startup kinks worked out   (Personnel  Security  etc)  I experienced a few hicups upfront (communication  billing  RV was broken into in the outside lot )  They immediately pursued getting a 7 000 volt electric fence installed and resolved the other issues   The fence is up and working and they gave me 3 months free rent to make it right   Definitely better than a chain storage facility Four major advantages for me are:1   Its climate controlled 2  They will accept packages for you and lock them in your unit for no additional charge   This is huge for me because I get boxes for work 2 or 3 times a week  now I dont have to come home to boxes on my door step every other day   i can do it once a week or so 3   Extremely clean and secure 4   Bills are emailed to me every month,positive,5430941

Wow! I loved this place!  Other than Korean BBQ its the first time i go to a Korean restaurant!  I loved the presentation of the food! I would definetely recommend this to anyone! I ordered the BBQ i think it was meal 7  it came with a pot of rice (I loved how the rice was served)  kemchi   beans and soup! It tasted great and the portion is just right for 1 person! A friend of mine ordered the seafood soup! It was served with a raw egg that u had to Crack when the boiling soup was served! Well I wont hide my excitement   it was pretty awesome! This meal was served with rice and other side dishes too! Looking around  almost everyone had well presented dishes which honestly made it hard to choose what I wanted to try!  The serviced was great and the servers were very friendly! When ever youre in Korea town this place is a goto place!,positive,6467735

Went here for a party with a filipino martial arts school  From the amazing service from Mayette herself and the array of delicious food available (especially the fried chicken and vegetarian spring rolls)  it was probably one of the better filipino restaurant experiences I had  The karaoke machine deserves a medal  all the strange songs hidden away on it made my sides hurt laughing the entire night (My dill goes MMM still sends me into fits)  I would definitely come back!,positive,6229253
Ive been coming here for years  They have the best macaroons in Vegas  Ill try any macaroon  but this is the only place I come back to I know they may look       different  However  the taste more than makes up for the appearance of these cookies  They are taller than the average macaroon but the shell is soft and moist  The cream between is smooth and flavorful  I usually get salted caramel and coffee  Salted caramel is heavenly  It truly is sweet AND salty  Coffee has a strong coffee flavor Vanilla is good  The fruit flavors are nice  Not too sweet  Come for SALTED CARAMEL!  They have other great desserts there  Lemon tart is good ,positive,2976972
I had high hopes for this place after reading all the reviews and checking out their menu  I was pleasantly surprised when I walked in  It was open and bright and clean  Definitely would be a place I would bring my family to  The menu had lots of variety and I had a hard time chosing   I opted for the fish tacos  the hubby got the sliders  The waitress was very friendly and attentive  The food came and the hubby loved the sliders and fries  The fish tacos were good  but nothing spectacular  The cilantro lime rice was very heavy on the lime  Overall the experience was good and I look forward to coming back and trying their ahi  and their flatbread pizza  Im sure ill have as much of a hard time deciding on somethung to try as I did this time ,positive,2137373

Ehh I dont think this was outrageous   I see why the 3 stars the food was okay  The pastrami was fatty could have been leaner  I guess I was supposed to ask for it leaner  I did ask for bread that didnt have a huge while and the waiter brought it over  Good waiter  It was a quick and easy place to eat before the show  Nothing to race about ,neutral,977981
Im so excited we finally have a Dutch Bro on this side of town! I came here for the grand opening for my free drink and OMG the turn out was amazing!!!! The drive thru was super duper long so i decided to park and wait in the line  The line was pretty long but I was so pleased and amazed of how organized everything was  I only waited less than 10mins for my free drink! The gentle man at the window (Tony) was great!!!! Customer services was on point  He shook my hand  welcomed me and thanked me for my business! I felt so welcomed and i cant wait to go back for my next drink! The drink that i always get is the Cookie Breve its has white chocolate and macadamia nut served over ice  MUST I SAY MORE? Its the best drink ever!!!! Im very happy that its tastes just like the other locations  Consistency is key to making me a loyal fan/customer!!!! I totally recommend Dutch Bros and totally recommend this location!!!!!,positive,2949492

Sat down on patio overlooking Lake Las Vegas  Very beautiful and relaxing  We enjoyed wine  appetizers and desert  I typically do not like Mussels because they are overcooked and dont taste well  This place was different  Cooked right soft and flavorful  Loved it! Brussel sprouts with bacon was very good too  We finished the night with deserts  Apple turnover looks different but tasted good  The server was super nice and took care of us so well ,positive,4379728
The food was plain no taste the carne sada frise was horrible  also the breakfast burrito was plain  and I hate leaving such a review  I figure it had good review thats  why I went there now put in mind it is attach to a bar when u walk in u will see the bar on the right hand side open into the restaurant  so the food more of a bar kinda food  also the reviews might be from drunk people ,negative,4887567
I found this place on Groupon  I had just moved to North Scottsdale  and didnt want to drive the 30 minutes to my fabulous but far away girl in Peoria  so the search was on for somewhere that was affordable with a good reputation  The Groupon deal was smokin  so I thought I would give it a try  I ended up with Derek  He asked what I liked about my hair and style  along with what I didnt like  He did a great job  and I left feeling fabulous  Im not the girl that spends a ton on color and products  but I do like my hair to look good  so paying for a good cut is always an option  I was so happy that i found a new home for my haircare needs in Loyal T  The shop is cute and doesnt feel pretentious  everyone is friendly  I even got a call before my appointment to tell me that Derek was running late so I could take my time showing up  Who does that? Apparently Loyal T !!!  Ill be back,positive,2067756

Dr  Suhair and her new practice are exactly what every mom needs    The trips to the pediatrician with sick kids is never convenient or easy  So its amazing having the option of the doctor coming right to you! Dr  Suhair and her MA come to you making everything so easy for mom and kids   She came when I had my newborn baby and all I can say is thank you for that   When youre a new mom its extremely difficult leaving the house  so It was a heaven sent gift to have her come do all the newborn checkup in my living room :) Another time my newborn was sick  but the other three were starting to come down with it  and after checking all four we found out they have ear infections! How convenient is it that all the kids can be checked right in the comfort of your own home! Nothing beats it  Our experience has been so worthwhile  Thank you At Home Pediatrics!,positive,949128
Its nice right when you walk through the door  but its too bright  The music is annoying  the tables are too close to each other  I dont think this place is going to fill up  The prices are resonable  I ordered the Blue Fin special and it was boring!! It had no flavor to it  The Cajun Albacore they used its like they smothered it in a mexican seasoning  It ruined the roll! My friend got the Over The Rainbow roll and she also said it was boring  Also the sushi rolls just completely fell apart!!! They werent rolled tight enough  We still ate it though because we were hungry  I wouldnt come back here  I love sushi and this is by far the second worst place I have come to! I was so excited for this place to open up and I regret making this decision They also were ALL on their phones just out in the open so we could see! I know theres something to do then just standing at the counter looking down at your mobile device ,negative,3270126
I visited Delux in my search for a replacement for Induldge  which sadly closed a couple months ago  Amazing cheeseburger  great fries  The chocolate shake was way too rich (must have been haagendaz)  The tables are super close together and it was packed even during an off time  No Indulge replacement  but a really good burger and fries  if they could just get their chocolate shake in line ;),positive,2680398
I was really hungry and so I decided to come here after lunch hour to try this place out  At that time  I think they ran out of free miso soup  from what I read in the reviews that they usually give out  When I went there  there were no customers so I ordered right away  I got the spicy bulgogi with rice and had to wait around 1015 minutes to make which could mean that they make the food to order during that time  The food come piping hot and I devoured it within minutes  It was a splendid portion  the bulgogi was not that spicy and also it was enough to fill me up for the day  Service was also quick and friendly though I did not really interact with them as much ,positive,2754266

I had a coupon so I decided to give this pizza joint a try  I didnt end up using any of the coupons/specials they offered as it didnt fit what I wanted; also  I was originally going to have it delivered but was turned off by the $4 50 delivery fee (yikes  thats more than the garlic knots I was going to get!)  I ended up getting the deluxe and substituting the mushrooms for olives (they actually followed through  which was great as many places ignore the notes section)  The pizza was great  good flavor but the sauce was a bit sweet  It was delicious though and FYI  its STILL good the day after :) The garlic knots were ok and made immensely better by the garlic butter they provided mmmm   ,positive,2107336

I called this company after seeing the high rating on Yelp   The dispatcher was kind and talked to me about our broken garbage disposal  offering us an estimate before scheduling the service   The plumber  Jim  was in our part of town on a call  so she scheduled us for that afternoon   Jim called as he left his previous appointment and was on our doorstep not even 2 hours after I called in   He was friendly  talked to us about our dogs  and replaced our garbage disposal in about 45 minutes   He cleaned up after himself and even showed us how to do some common troubleshooting if we ever have problems in the future   He charged us exactly what the dispatcher estimated  and they take payments via Paypal  which is just so easy   I am so thrilled with how painless our experience with A Better Plumbing was!,positive,1918016
Center City Green used to be my goto parking deck  mostly because its right in the middle of everything  but no one would ever park there  The best reason to go was that they had great evening/night rates: Just $5  even during many events and festivals  Being just across the street from the arena Unfortunately  they recently changed their pricing structure  so they dont start night prices until after 7pm  Now thats not horrible  but if youre coming for dinner or some other event that starts earlier  youll have to pay the charge which can really rack up  and if you dont pay close attention  itll really bite you  Instead of $5  it may be as much as $10 or $12  so watch out  Or  just go out later ,neutral,715757

This place sucks  To darn expensive for one the resort fee is way to much and they want it right away to  Funny thing is we did not even use the pool or anything  Then you go up to your room and they have mini snacks the price is so damn expensive to so we found a place to buy snacks and drinks cheaper  Also since the resort fee had to be paid up front we had no money so we ended up doing time shares and saying no to get free stuff to do until we got paid  Funny thing is we did not eat at anything in Mandalay bay either to expensive  This place is a rip off  Dont stay here  Plus it is way off the strip ,negative,5540759
Cute cute place! Quite hidden in my opinion if it wasnt for a friends post The place inside was very warm  temperature wise  Came here in the summer so maybe their AC wasnt jacked up yet  But  their food made up for it  Came here specifically for their takoyaki (squid balls)  It came in a small dish of 6  good for sharing or for yourself  The outside was nice and crisp  while inside was warm and soft  It was however a bit strong on the ginger side  If youre a fan of ginger this might be the place for you We also ordered the gyuu don; portion was pretty decent for what you pay for and the dish was served fresh and warm  The menu was also really cute  the little Manpuku man  Note: the employees there are Japanese so try to be patient if they dont understand what you say the first time  They are very polite though so points to service ,neutral,794865

Lets face it  We all go there  But most of us drink the coffee because it wakes us up  Not because it tastes soooo good  But the Starbucks drivethru process is NOT efficient and timely  They should also consider a limit to be in the drivethru line  If the person in front of me ordered 7 frapps  they should have to go inside  Drivethru  limit two!

Everyone raves about how great this place is but I was not impressed by either times I visited  I went and sat down for lunch one time with a friend and the service was horrible  The server was not nice and was slow (we were basically teh only people there)  The food was medicore and the atmosphere was filled with tvs  The second time I tried here was when I ordered take out  Again the food was not impressive and not worth the price  I guess time my friends drag me here to visit Ill stick with drinking rather than eating ,negative,1010329
These guys are great! Im happy to know how the City likes to keep its citizens in line  And because the govenment likes to make it hard to live in the city  we dont need to worry about over populating  This is a well thought of stategy  It makes the people who live here happy to vacate  leaving room for the people who matter ( New commers)! Oh yah and guess what?Have you ever noticed how often police like to commit traffic offences them selves  Oh how I love this city  We use the honerable lead by example rule  Oh and ttc drivers make this another exciting reason to inhabit this wonderful metropolis  Work for government and get you free immunity card  Cant wait to see you again!,positive,5091093

Unfortunately it is still the same  they said for 1 month that fixing my equipment supplied by them was not their responsibility  even when I was paying all the dues  they deactivated my equipment  After a lot of haggling  they accepted responsibility  and passed it on to a sister company I wish I never have to deal with them again  Please do not go there or use their services  There are a lot of other companies in the valley which are smaller and have better services Lincare keeps on buying competitors who are very good in their business and market share and kill them ,negative,5763493

4 small chicken tenders  bits and pieces of plain crinkle cut fries  and a huge piece of bread for $8  Pros:  breading was crispyCons: chicken is mushy  like it was precooked before it was breaded and fried  Fries are ridiculous  if you combine all the pieces you might get 10 regular size fries  Not a good value ,negative,53877

Very unprofessional instructors went to visit my barber more than once and always unprofessional instructors  They dont care about their barbers and single themselves with their favorite barbers  The instructor even came to me once as a client saying I had paraphernalia saying I smelled like weed  I felt completely disrespected especially knowing perfectly well I had nothing  Meanwhile he smelled like and the aroma was all around him  His eyes were very chinky while hes asking me this by the way! Just unprofessional barbershop wouldnt step a foot in their school or any of their barbershops again!!!,negative,5862511

I can read da english  but cant figure out what everything is   Doesnt matter though  because all this stuff is  TASTY Asian Pastries mixed with European flair works   Kinda like a fusion dessert place  1   Cookies  They have all these cookies with different flavors like green tea  almonds and some kinda rock looking cookie/pastry   Most are thin  delicate and melt in your mouth 2   Pastries  Really great stuff  some have things inside like the normal european stuff to pizza looking asian concoctions   Tasty   The kids like them too!

This location is similar to the one on Yonge street and has the same menu  Its relatively accessible with no stairs  you just have to get through two doors at the entrance  The restaurant is well designed and modern looking  The service was good but not as good as the Yonge street location  I ordered the Beef Fusion: grilled satay beef tenderloin with mango salad  It was good and authentic  no iceberg lettuce here ,neutral,5373140
I love the variety and they make a pretty awesome and very drool worthy  Shepards Pie! Its one of my favorite foods that I often find myself craving randomly  My complaint though : tight seating so it always feel over crowded to a point you wonder if fire code is being broken  So I bribe friends (buy their dinner as well) into grabbing me a togo box because going in person gives me too much anxiety with the amount of people that always seem to be there ,positive,2421641

A classic burger joint that keeps it simple  InnOut has a very charming appeal to diners of all types They seem to be sticking to what they know best  yet its apparent that they have adapted over the years to perfect their offerings  Burgers  fries  and shakes is whats on the menu  Using their ingredients  you can pretty much make any variation you want and fully customize your meal The secret menu isnt so secret  as its basically a manual for how to customize the experience to your liking  I truly appreciate an establishments willingness to cater to the customer  I myself am a vegetarian  and I look forward to the few times a year that I come across an InnOut Grill Chz w chilies X chilies X toast & FF Well  To me  thats worth returning  (Plus it doesnt hurt that it totals to $4 00 even  talk about a good deal for veggies),positive,75904
Love love love this place  As someone who grew up in China eating beef noodle soup for breakfast everyday  my standards are high  BUT this place definitely wowed me  Their beef is tender  noodles are the perfect texture and the broth is incredibly flavorful despite how clear and clean it is  On top of that the service was great and the prices are reasonable The only complaint I have is that they have the tables too close together  So when youre sitting at a table for two it kind of feels like youre actually at a table for four with 2 complete strangers For those planning on trying this place here are my tips:For thickness  you cant go wrong with jo ye (the standard size)For spice level I recommend going with mild because their medium is loaded with chili oilAnd just fyi I always order their small and I struggle every time to finish it   so dont hurt yourself by thinking you want an XLGB is quickly becoming one of my favorite places to eat in Toronto ,positive,3482363

Walking into Smash is like walking into the really big basement of some kind of eccentric hipster  An amazing mix of reclaimed furniture  strange artefacts  charming old Canadiana & things like a giant pile of vintage tin army helmets  all thrown in together in this strange warehouselike space A couple of my favourite things I saw while browsing included a really oldschool billiardlike game with stone game balls  the terrific screenprints they make inhouse (especially the old map of Canada!)  a giant table full of big glass bottles  and a big old cabinet with a flaking paint job  Oh  and that lovely musty smell of Old Stuff  too  You could look around in all the nooks and crannies and find something awesome pretty much every five minutes  Prices are prohibitive for someone like me  but im still giving it 4 stars for the awesome browsing opportunities  When I get myself a sugar daddy you better believe ill be back  Smash!,positive,5903195
Came here for brunch  Waited about 20 mins outside to get a seat  Ordered their chick and chop it was good! Shared a waffle with a friend and it was delicious! Real maple syrup was to die for!

Usually people have the most awful things to say about their first time going with a full service moving company  especially going long distance  I was so scared taking this step  it was so overwhelming  From the start   submitting for quotes & being bombarded with phone calls of what felt like people trying to just take my money  Ally was really helpful from the start  She helped me with my estimate  questions  and the movers were on time and provided me with great service from start to finish and for the right price  There is a reason this company has their A rating with the Better Business Bureau  Ill definitely be using them if I ever have to move again  but hopefully I never have to!!!,positive,5788240

Came to enjoy a family night out of cosmic bowling but was left to be disappointed when there was cosmic lights with no music  Asked mgt about it and they stated a speaker blew out and it has to be replaced  Its unfortunate when you pay 80 for an evening out with the kids and have high hope to be let down  Other than that the facility is a little outdated but kept clean  Staff was nice even though they didnt give two cares about the music and the do have a full bar and snack bar as well  We will back again to give it a second chance to see if they fix the broken amp ,neutral,693584

The food here is consistently good  but the service is pretty miserable  All I wanted was takeout! Admittedly it was a busy night  but cmon  bad service for takeout?!Other than that it looked like other people were doing just ifne and enjoying their dishes  I kept it really simple and had white rice and some steamed veggies  which did have a little bit of a sauce on them  They had a nice flavor  and I left with about a $10 bill (including an iced tea) When I tried to pay with a credit card  the woman said  Dont you have cash? I looked at her in complete bewilderment  Who the hell says that to a customer?! Clearly she was feeling stressed out  so rather than make a scene I decided to part with a few greenbacks Id like to go again and try out the eatin option to see if theyll do better next time  Cmon Lulus!

Located in the middle of Montreal downtown  this place offers vegetarian options for both dinner and lunch  I went there during dinner time  around 8:30pm  on a Friday evening  Going in the restaurant  we were seated fairly quickly  The decor itself is very nice and welcoming  The service was also outstanding  and quick  The menu offered multiple choices of appetizers and also main dishes  and all are vegan/vegetarian choices  For the appetizer  we went for their vegan poutine  which to be honest was not great unfortunately  Or it may be as well the weird taste and consistency that threw me off  but definitely not a favorite at first bite  For the main course  I went for their risotto  which was good  but after a few bites  The mushroom that came with it complemented well the plate  Overall  a nice place with great decor  excellent service  and good vegan/vegetarian food ,positive,3447827

Once past the strange vibes of this at once overly ornate and simultaneously cavernous restaurant  the food is surprisingly good  Not much that is unique  but well executed Middle Eastern food  On weekends they offer entertainment and one most likely to require ear protection  The basterma and baba were very good  The Armenian sala a surprise  and the lefts plate plentiful  Enjoy!,positive,4050213
The food here is OK   It isnt French  as the name might suggest  and the presentation leaves a lot to be desired   The prices are high for their offerings and people might be better off going to Crane Alley next door (We were just there again this morning and they botched our order   They gave us prosciutto in a vegetarian sandwich ),neutral,4842798
This was my first experience dining here and was not disappointed   2 of us went around 2:30 pm on a Saturday and had no problem getting a table without a reservation   All the food was delicious  the salad bar  all the meats (that were brought to the table every few minutes)  the side dishes and even the bread  The staff couldnt have been nicer and we especially loved our server Justin  Warning to come hungry and with money  complete dinner was pricey  but worth it for a special occasion!

The Eel with Teriyaki Sauce with Rice was the first to arrive   It was so colourful and all fit neatly in a little pot   I actually really enjoyed this one because the eel was so soft  tender  and delicious with the teriyaki sauce   The slight sauce that mixed into the rice was really good as well Unfortunately  there were only two skewers of the Curried Baby Octopus  but the small piece that I did have was so delicious!  The baby octopus was smooth and tender and wasnt chewy at all   It was abundantly seasoned with a rich curry too ,neutral,4735080
Solid stay for cheap  On a holiday weekend we had to pay $20/night to get upgraded to the north tower  Checkin was quick  and we were in 2 hours early too   Beds were comfy  place was quiet  room was spacious enough   Location was awesome  on a chilly night we still had our choice of gambling between Ballys & Paris since theyre connected and I never had to go outside and freeze   Caesars  Planet Hollywood  and Bills  all high on my list of favorite places to gamble were within 510 minutes walking  Considering it takes like 10 minutes just to get from room to lobby in the Bellagio  I was quite pleased not to waste time  The side exit makes the trip to Ellis Island even faster!Minor complaint is that the shower head sucked  it was all misty (whaa!) and you cant really control the temperature of the room  Either all rooms have heat on or all have cold on  and of course they had already turned the heat off for the spring but it was still like 50 degrees outside at night  :(,positive,4542385
I go here at least once a week  sometimes more  The food tastes like it is made with love! The staff are seriously the best ever  They feel like family! Every so often a dish will disappoint me but when you eat as much as I do  its bound to happen ,positive,2080239

I had a good breakfast here  I ordered the Florentine Crepe and some orange juice  Service was fast  which I was happy about since I was starving  I would say that the Crepe mixture wasnt my favorite but it was good  I think the Crepe was too sweet for a savory dish  The orange juice though was great freshly squeezed ,neutral,2109628
I LOVE THIS RESTAURANT TO DEATH!! Sure it might just empty out my wallet for the week  but it is worth every single penny!! I would highly recommend the lobster miso soup  aburi  JaBistroll  nama classic nigiri  The sushi are meltinmymouthIcouldgotoheaven divine  While the cooked dishes are also of high quality  I find them in general overpriced for the portion and taste  I dont think they are anything to rave about  Service is extremely attentive  I would highly recommend this place  just make sure to make reservations beforehand ,positive,1806632

You are kinda between a rock and a hard place if youre out see some stellar live jazz music   This place is the place to go    the greatest players  starting in the late afternoon  7 days a week Its just a little dingy inside    and usually extremely packed  understandably   They have awkward cafeteria seating  with a few booths  and generally terrible sight lines to the stage from anywhere in the bar  other than right in front of the stage The food and beverage selection are decent and well priced   I would go more often if they renovated!Tip: Have cash for the cover charge at the door ,positive,6515648

Dry     Frozen      Patty      Sad!  The costumer service was excellent  the beer was fantastic  but the burger was like a patty from the the frozen section at a grocery store ,negative,958806
Decided to try the buffet even though we were a little skeptical due to the ratings  Sharon  our server was a joy  She helped us to know what to do in the Mirage and when to see the shows  Always very quick with the Champage refills and any requests  The food in the buffet was very well prepared and there are many varieties from which to chose  The omelet station was perfect with hardly any wait and certainly made to order without butter  Would definitely return and feel the value is worth what you pay ,positive,835700

My hair was so long and without shape that I always had it in a bun  Even when I went to other salons  they would cut it but the waves would not get used to that cut  I found this place on Yelp after looking for a curl specialist so that I would be able to leave my hair down and I found this salon  I love that youre able to make an appointment for a consultation to tell them the type of cut you want and they tell you what they could do and recommend before you make an appointment for your cut  After my consultation  I went for my cut and treatment and Im in love!! Danielle gave my hair shape and kept my length! I loved how soft the products made my hair feel  I highly recommend this place and I also recommend Danielle  Shes super sweet and you could tell she loves what she does ,positive,3751311

Horrible   When I called  the kid answering the phone hung up on me three times because he was getting too many calls and then  once I got him on the line he gave me grief for wanting to talk to the owner   He wouldnt say his or the owners name and wanted to hang up on me   I was actually calling to complain about a driver that was trying to extort extra cash from me for having a baby   These people are dirty and dishonest and they obviously dont care ,negative,1780503
Nice and friendly staff  slightly small dining area but cozy  We sat at the bar which was nice except that the chairs about 4 inches below the bar so makes it slightly difficult to eat out of the bowl that contains hot broth    food is overall tasty  recommend ordering take out rather then dining in ,positive,3873458
Tamara is such a sweet waitress! Very helpful and nice  I like how you get to put a sign when you need a waitress to help you  It made it very easy to get help  I loved the food here  I got the enchilada omlette which was good but I wish it tasted more like tomato sauce rather than chili  The banana muffins are soooo good! That is a must ,positive,4682475
Wife was pressured in to purchasing $7k worth of products    Made her take it all back to the store 2 hours later  Told them to give our money back They said no and we left the products with the sales guy      didnt get our money back or the products   list the dispute with the credit card company   Out 7 grand & no product    I willKeep posting until this company is no longer in business   taking advantage of a 70 year old woman is unAmerican and shameful,negative,6400701

Weve been here on multiple occasions; whether its for a few drinks at the bar  a quiet dinner  or a birthday dinner for a party of 50  They always seem to accommodate  Although Id love it if they took reservations  they always get us in  Expect to wait to be seated at least 30 minutes on Friday and Saturday ,positive,6183714
First place we had dinner while visiting and it didnt disappoint  Place is fun  neon signs  masks and art on wall  Waiter was really kool made some great food and drink reccomendations (get the pork ribs and Shinobi drink)  He even gave us reccomendations for new years    Mentioned that they opened a Mexican restaurant nearby as well  on the list for the next visit!,positive,1144404
If I could give 0 stars I would   Today they came to fix a toilet   A older gentlemen very rude and stuns highly of bad BO  He said he could touch the toilet because there was the blue toilet cleaner in the back tank and cried like a baby about it  He told me I had to drain the toilet for him to work on it and I told him no and if he didnt want to fix it he could leave and I will reschedule  He told me to F off and priced to make rude comments as he took the toilet apart  The entire time he attempted to fix it he was cursing and getting aggravated  VERY RUDE  Now I have to clean the bathroom from the mess and get his stench out of there too   So discussing  Also refused to clean up mess and said it was  It his job  Then proceeded to tell me the toilet bowl cleaner ruined the toilet,negative,3090163

Halo  Halo kitchen is one of my favorites when Im craving Asian food  I have been meaning to take a friend with me being that she loves noodles  pancit to be precise  This past week I was able to bring her here to lunch and she enjoyed it! We both had the adobo and pancit and I ordered menudo for us to share  The menudo here is definitely different from Spanish menudo  My Asian cravings and adobo fix were complete! I would much rather come to Halo Halo versus Panda Express  The only down side is that its slightly more pricier  but you get what you pay for  There is also a dessert bar where they make boba drinks and have Thrifty ice cream  my favorite!!! Their breakfast menu is all day and they have many plate varieties  That will be the next thing Im looking forward to trying!,positive,1678283
One late afternoon I broke my screen and camera on my phone  called several places and they were closing but Affordable Technology Repairs told me to come in even though the owner of the company was just getting back from vacation  He had one of his employees look at my phone when it was almost closing time and stayed past the closing for me since I was having more issues with my phone than I initially thought  The owner went out of his way to swing by since the employee couldnt fix the issue I was having and they didnt have any white screens in stock so they generously lended me the black one and said they would fix my camera for free when I come back the next day  I came back the next day and they fixed it  A couple weeks later the adhesive was coming off my phone  but they kindly fixed it again for me free of charge  Really nice people!,positive,4052502
I loved the Biodome! This is such a fun museum to learn about different animals and their habitats  Its also walking distance from the Botanical Gardens (with very wellmarked signs along the way)  You can get a ticket package and visit both sites in one day  Go to the Biodome early  when they first open  to beat the long lines  My favorites were the Capybara in the rainforest  the Canadian Lynx in the Laurentian Mountain section  and the Penguins in the Arctic section  Their special exhibit was on Sloths  Unfortunately the sloths were either sleeping or too shy  as I didnt actually get to see them come out of their domicile  Id definitely go back  and its great for kids!,positive,2466636
The food is authentic and great portions for the price  We had the green curry  heavenly beef combo and Pad Thai  All came with soup and a great sweet tea  You have to wait a bit for the food because they cook to order but it is worth the wait Its a regular stop on my food Rolodex ,positive,4854411
Fries! Fries! Fries!Omg the peri fries were to die for  So crunchy but still juicy  Got a large for the 2 of us  and it still wasnt enough  They have a takeout special for 1 whole chicken with one large side for $19 99  We got a large size of peri rice as well  which was ok  The chicken was perfectly grilled (tender and well seasoned)  which was cut into 8 pieces  enough for 3 ppl or 2 very hungry ppl  Will definitely go back again!,positive,1295666
4 5 stars if I could! My review is based on several visits during lunch  My impression: this is the best Chinese restaurant Ive tried in my 8 years of living in Phoenix  Originally from Seattle  Ive had my share of Chinese food  This place is very good! Im very impressed  Love the egg drop soup  The fried rice needs a little more veggies/eggs  but overall had a good flavor  The chicken they use is very good quality  My whole family really enjoyed this place  Not sure why so many low reviews on here  Im quite confused   ,positive,56536

My girlfriend and I love Pizza Hut; however  I think were going to be ordering from another business      Weve order three different times  and each time weve gotten wrong orders   Its too common to have mistakes every time we order   This is ridiculous   The line people need to pay attention to what theyre putting on each order; the cutter (whos often a manager) should be double checking that the toppings match the order; and finally (not in all stores) drivers check the orders before loading up for a run   So  after all that which could have prevented this  all three times weve gotten wrong orders   WTF!?   I recommend that you go elsewhere ,negative,3744039
The owners say they are doing very well since moving to their new location on Horizon Ridge Parkway in Henderson  On a recent Saturday night they were slammed with diners and all seemed to be truly enjoying themselves  At our table the food was hit and miss  the restaurant ran out of the dinner special  and the substitution (their recommendation) turned out to be more Asianfusion than Italian  and was just okay Its a quaint and friendly atmosphere  and they appear to be trying very hard to please   so well give them another try and see what happens ,neutral,4952599

I love there cheap vietnamese ice coffee and grilled pork sandwichs  I usually like to stop here before a hike to get my caffeine fix and lunch on the go  I like to drink a little ice coffee first and then let the ice melt and then add a little water to make it last  The sandwichs are great for hikes because they preserved nicely with the fresh french bread crispy crust to seal in the juicey meat and pickled vegatables  Awe  I wish they still had one in Sac town  I guess I will have to find a closer alternative ,positive,2424781
Ugh The only reason why I went is because coworkers wanted to go   While I understand the concept of fine dining highend Asian food     wait  no   I dont understand it at all   Other than trying to make money off nonAsian people who like kung pao chicken and have enough to pay $20 for a $5 bowl of pho  I cant see why anyone would go back Needless to say  the ambiance was okay   The menu had WAY too many items  making you question what is it that they specialize in?  Well  not the wonton soup   It was quite bland   I got the spicy filet mignon noodle soup   While it was good and the beef was tender  its nothing I would come back for ,neutral,5752873

Zach is awesome! He is very knowledgable  affordable and doesnt have contracts  Hes organized and has never needed to reschedule or not show up  We have our primary residence and our rental house and Zach is prompt to come to either one when we call him  We had to call him on a Friday because we found some ants at our rental and had someone checking in on a Saturday  He came Saturday morning and the renters were nonethewiser because they were all gone by the time they arrived  Hes incredibly thorough and considerate  He came once while our baby was asleep and he was quiet and polite  Im not sure theres anyone friendlier either  We highly recommend Zach for your pest control needs!,positive,6550229
Probably the best Indo Chinese Ive had in North America  Went for lunch special and got some huge portions for just $9 per entree!

Ozus Spicy Miso Ramen is testament to their mastery of a sultry umami dish with just enough heat to keep you craving more with every bite  The host and servers could not have been more friendly or attentive in the middle of a lunch rush  Will certainly be back again soon ,positive,4168140
They failed to mention that their buffet (one of the best in Las Vegas) was closed for a week during my stay  That was the only reason Im came to this hotel other than that  They werent too shabby and they had a GREAT fitness center  They refunded my money and I was able to check out early for another hotel ,neutral,5117970
My wife and I have been to a halfdozen of these types of shows in Las Vegas and this is by far the best  The theater is mediumsized  There are major advantages to buying VIP as some of the scenes are below eye level for those in the back The dancing was excellent and the scenes were all awesome  Note that this is a true topless show  There are no pasties  The pole dancing and a certain other scene were especially erotic  There is also some audience participation  Jennifer Romas talks to the crowd after the show and the girls are waiting by the exit  Drink prices were reasonable  A call and import beer were $18  Weve been to this type of show where drinks are $16 each ,positive,3828237

We are just finishing up a one night stay to celebrate our wedding anniversary  I have to say I am very disappointed in the overall experience  Parking:  the hotel sponsored valet parking ( note there is no self park on a hotel lot) was $32 for the night    extremely difficult to navigate to due to downtown traffic   bus lanes   etc   Some of this is standard for a hotel in a urban area but the lack of signage and no hotel representative made it more difficult  No assistance with the bags was offered to remove from trunk or bring into hotel  Check In:  I had requested some extras ( that I would pay for )in the room and mentioned it was our anniversary in the reservation   The clerk apparently had no knowledge of this and no extras or greetings were provided   The Room:  I enjoyed the room and the general facilities very nice accommodations  I just did not have the experience I expected from The Embassy Suites,negative,5946546
Our friends introduced us to this place   I want to go back again!  We had brunch outside in the sun  It was a beautiful day   The menu was huge  had a hard time choosing  so many amazing options!

The customer service is excellent  they carry a ton of ice cream flavors  even durian!

Great Mexican food in Central Phoenix   I havent been here when its too busy  which always seems to be the case at other Upward Projects restaurants   So Im happy to have Joyride be my new go to   I can find parking  get good drinks  good service  delicious tacos etc  and the best churros Ive ever had   (the cheese y mas is a must try but dangerous for the dairy intolerant)  They have a lot of open doors windows  so depending on the weather it can get a bit chilly and they keep it kinda dark   But otherwise  weve been very happy with our dining experiences here ,positive,1415516
They were closing up but invited us in anyway  Everything was put away and they still said they will take our order  Were getting it to go so  Ill have to comment on how good or not so good later ;)After I read the reviews about how salty the fries were  I asked the guy behind the counter if he already prepared them   He had  so I mentioned to him I was going to ask him to go light on the fries   He said he would pick out the the light ones LOLWe brought our food home and it was pipping hot!  I have to say this was the best Philly Steak Sandwich Ive tasted since I was in Philadelphia many many many years ago 1980s!!! I bought 2 combos  #2 on the menu   Sandwich  fries and a soda   My son upgraded his sandwich to a foot long  The price came to $24 00 and some change   The sandwich was awesome!!! Fries are over seasoned so if you can ask for NO season  or lightly seasoned!,neutral,5141597
A good late night meal option in Vegas   Tasty  clean food  Ordered the cauliflower patty veg burger which comes with fries  It was delicious !!

Food was pretty good  First time doing take out  horrible wait service  Wait was 45mins  as told  but waited an additional 30mins when I got there  It wasnt like there were a lot of people dinning in  There were more take out orders  and everyone had to wait additionally while we were there  Food finally  was ready  but there the garlic nann was a small single order  so I added 2 more  Was told it would be another 5min    it was like 1015mins! How is there not just a ton of garlic nann under a warmer ready to go! Poor people in he restaurant were waiting forever for their food too  I dont think anyone was actually eating  Will not be dinning in or take or ever again with them!!

Usually I have very minor issues with this Subway  I think their food tastes better than  any other Subway Ive visited  Occasionally they have soup  During this visit  and another time a month ago  I ordered soup  The first time they put the soup in the bag  then the sub and held it upright  I was getting my drink so I didnt notice  The soup had opened and was filling 1/2 inches of the Subway bag   Well  tonight    they had seperate bags  nothing spilled  The guy getting the soup seemed to be scraping the bottom  I didnt mind  someone has to eat the last  When I got home the cup of soup was just barely over 1/2 on the container and barely warm  See photo  I was very disappointed ,neutral,5786703

Owie  My belly hurt after eating here  I was looking forward to steamed veggies  but they didnt have any  Said they were out  Total bummer  So  I ate some shrimp spring rolls and sampled others  I steered clear of fried stuff  but it didnt seem to matter  My belly was upset almost immediately  Maybe it was the coconut bread  I couldnt help myself; it was super tasty!After my friends had plucked something off the dessert cart  the server brought us some bok choy  I thought they were out  but I guess they had some hiding in the kitchen? Anyway  I ate that happily  It was the first time I ever tried bok choy  Im a fan!

Simply a lot of fun While the place is nice and clean inside dont go expecting fancy    Any place that encourages mess by providing gloves  bibs and where you eat with your hands  is my kind of fun We had crab and shrimp in the pot and it was spicy and delicious   We also had lamb on skewers which was tasty as well Overall good value   The only thing lacking is service  it can be slow with few waitresses but we didnt mind as we were tucked away in our booth and thoroughly enjoyed our time there People seeking bland food can avoid Hot Feel   Hard to find but worth the effort ,positive,4446721
I thought that this was a wonderful value! We sat at the bar and were served immediately   We shared a pasta off the make your own pasta menu and it was more food than we could have ever dreamed of eating in one sitting   Our waiter was friendly  the ambiance was fun  and the drinks at the bar were some of the least expensive I have seen on the strip! A super solid experience all around ,positive,2633667

This place is horrible     Golf in the Arizona summer with no water on the course  The drink girl said last call at noon with an 11:30 tee time  Course was in rough shape to start with  Other golfers skipping holes and randomly jumping in front of our group  This was by far my worst golf day experience ever!! Never pay money to play here  matter of fact never golf here for free ,negative,5483466

Here for vacation desperately needed a massage but was concerned about professionalism  Thanks to Yelp and other reviewers I found this place  I had a 90 minute combination Thai massage  I normally get a deep tissue back home but am so glad I gave this a try    AMAZING!

Really yummy and fresh sushi (especially for the price  I had the 18 pcs Maki Set C for $18 02 after tax) comparable to Mi Ne up Yonge a bit   The service was friendly and quick  no complaints   Atmosphere was enjoyable and pretty quiet (went around 4pm on a Wednesday  only considerable noise was from cp24 playing on the tv)  the restaurant is clean and well maintained  booths are available in a separate section  however we chose to sit in the main area   We did receive (unexpectedly) a few free appetizers calamari tempura and crunchy noodle soup   Looking forward to coming back!,positive,4321009
Make no mistake this is not a fast food joint but a quick food joint  The burgers are great (its the high quality ingredients and the bun) french fries are good (would of been better but were over cooked) and a large fry can be split three or four ways  Much better than INNOUT (I know sacrilege  but true)  I wish they would lose the commercially bagged  tea and realize in the west only fresh brewed measures up ,positive,3572535
It is a zoo at this airport  Very crowded in some areas with fast walking people  yet very empty in other locations  I had to weave around people to keep up with my friend (thankfully I didnt carry any luggage with wheels)  Got bumped into numerous times  But overall  the airport looks well maintained  I enjoyed seeing the trees and greenery on the inside  I also enjoyed seeing the lights from outside the airport  While standing outside in the uber/lyft area  I noticed that there are workers there with whistles to direct the traffic  I have never seen that before  so I found it interesting  Our Uber driver told us sometimes having the people with whistles does more harm than good  but sometimes it works smoothly,neutral,3208411

I have been going to advance medical weight loss for about 3 months and I have been seeing one of the counselors for a while a lately she has been really mean to me a rude and late to the appointment  I told her that I have things to do and she just opened the door and dismissed me and had a really big attitude with me so I changed the counselor there  I am so Unhappy with the experience  I paid $700 to help me lose weight and she just made my day very unpleasant  I go every 2 weeks now but if it keep being this way I will not go because I was going to start the b 12 shots  She is suppose to be nice and helpful but I felt like she was berating me  So far I lost 30 lbs  I am happy but not with the lady who was suppose to be helpful  She needs an attitude adjustment or people will not go  People want to feel like someone cares and is nice and helpful  She isnt that  In our diets we have our mishaps but she is not caring  Im so unhappy ,negative,2206343

This is a refreshingly creative and appetizing dining experience  The atmosphere is intimate and eclectic with many interest points  such as commissioned artwork  wine collection  beautiful dessert case and viewable kitchen  The menu is extensive with wide variety  and is truly Mediterranean  You can taste the freshness of each skillfully prepared dish  The service is attentive and goes above and beyond  Our waiter even gave us very useful tips about our upcoming visit to the Hale Theatre  An absolute delight!,positive,5235509
With so many sushi places in Vegas  youd think theyd give better service to attract customers  To begin with there was a long wait to be seated  even after our table opened up  The server pretty much ignored our party  We had to remind them of our orders  the last two rolls took forever to be delivered to the table  Will not return here and honestly dont suggest it  On a positive note  the strawberry mochi was good ,negative,6411468
What a dump  Cold food  Empty restaurant so the food just got colder  The crusty mens room looks like something in Afghanistan  Graffiti and rusty walls  If you do go  make sure youre there when a tour bus is there so the food gets cycled faster  Some of the food tastes ok and I dont feel sick hours later so thats good  Thats not enough to make this place worth going to in a town with fabulous restaurants  Lowes is right next door  Buy a couple of cans of paint for crying out loud,negative,6300513
The coffee has high quality and styled  However  as a coffin lover  the Amerciano coffee is not very strong  It is my first to have Americano coffee with milk  The juice tastes really natural  The environment is stylish and cool  so it is a GREAT study place to recommend for students  Comparatively speaking  the price level is like Aroma expresso store  quantum coffee gets better store outlets  I would definitely recommend this store ,positive,4809095
when it was $5 large 1 topping it was worthy of 5 stars in terms of value and taste  now its 3 cause its just another normal priced place with above average pizza  really dropped the ballsacj on the more than $5 thing what a crock kf shit  oh well i still eat there when im shit faced lol,neutral,6661653

It usually takes hours to do my hair because I have so much of it  but she was lightning quick  And she even had time do do my cousins hair  who did not have an appointment  Its a bit expensive but worth it  Complimentary beverages add a nice touch  Will be my goto salon in Vegas  Thanks again Yelpers!,positive,2799902

His office staff is also very sweet ,positive,949108
To say I was surprised by this restaurant would be a gross understatement  As a huge fan of the Food Network  I have found most of the restaurants associated with the networks various stars to be somewhat underwhelming  However  Giadas restaurant absolutely blew us away  The atmosphere is intimate and fun and the food was stunning  All of our courses were delicious and our server was very knowledgeable and friendly  guiding us toward items to meet our expectations  As we had already experienced Bobby Flays Mesa Grill  I can whole heartedly say  in the always enjoyable rivalry between Giada and Bobby  the fairer sex prevailed  In all honesty  it wasnt even a contest   Do NOT skip this restaurant ,positive,5677968

Yet another stop on my quest for amazing bbq since moving here and leaving my backyard and smoker behind   Im generally disappointed but Midwood was a pleasant surprise   Of the dozen or so places Ive tried in and around Charlotte  Midwood is probably the best but the ribs are still just ok  no char  no amazing dry rub and sauces that are moderate when it comes to flavor   The vibe of the restaurant is laid back  has a nice neighborhood feel  the menu has all the bqq joint classics and a few surprises as well   The staff are courteous and efficient which probably helps since Midwood obviously deals with a great deal of volume   If I have guests who want bbq Ill likely take them here but I still dream of finding an old dude in a shack with ribs that make me weep ,positive,6512867
i like this place  i probably like THE hotel a little better just cus of the shorter walk from the rooms to the casino    but they are equally nice  clean  comfortable  though they are far from the casino  they have a pretty decent breakfast/brunch location at tower 2  and a starbucks at tower 1    the indoor gym is really nice too   id come back again if we ever get a good deal!,positive,6593041
Very tasty thin crust pizza   I was actually a little surprised how good this was   Our set of three guys got a sausage  pepperoni and mushroom large; it would have been too little food for three younger athletic types  but for three shlubs  it was perfect  in part because we ordered a tasty large caesar salad to go with it   The toppings on the pizza were great; the pepperoni slices in particular were excellent   Our server and a manager were around a few times inbetween bringing the food/drinks to chat  which is always a nice touch for someone like myself who visits a new town and likes to chat up the locals   The text message system was perfect for our wait time; we put in our name and were told it would be 4550 minutes  so I cheated back to the HoJo on Indian School for a little while and when the text came in  hauled back to the restaurant to make our seating   Ill be back the next time I visit!,positive,5860608
Small menu  weird spring rolls  they heated spmething up in the microwave (one of the appetizers we ordered and the sauce (never a good sign)  The pho tasted good but the soup was not pipping hot like I like  Inconsistent and unusual service  At one point there were no employeese in the front with us  They were all in the kitchen  It is very scarily slow but it was ranked #2 on Yelp so I tried it out  Jury is still out  Guess Im still shopping around for the perfect pho place ,negative,4465963

I ordered to go and I will not be returning  The food was decent  although they did forget to include the fixing for my pho which made it taste very plain  The service I received when I arrived to pick up my food to me  was unacceptable  I ordered a Thai iced tea for my wait because my food was not done yet and when I tried to pay with my card the lady informed me they do not take cards for a total less than $5 (the tea was 3) and then said rudely  that I shouldve asked first ,negative,2516953
Its been years since I went to Destiny   My girlfriends and I decided to grab a drink after dinner Friday night  luckily we arrived at 2130 and not 2200 as the place started to fill up  The drinks were okay  I remember them tasting richer  I ordered a sesame milk tea and it was  a bit watery for me  Our server was lovely  she was polite and patient  We ordered one plate of snack and one drink each   and sat there for 2 hours  This is a great place to catch up with old friends with no seating time limit  The only downside was the lingering smell of food on my hair and clothes ,negative,3260548

Located within the Mekong Market  I liked their food here and service was good too Came here in a rainy day and warm noodle soup sounded so good  I never had any other type of noodle beside the standard thin rice noodle at any Vietnamese restaurants and the clear noodle they had was very good I also learned I like this vegetable called tano  It was served as a side  I didnt know what it was at first but I liked it so much  I asked the server the name of this vegetable  He didnt know how to say it English  he gave me a sample to take it to the grocery store there so I can buy some to take home  I found them and I enjoyed this vegetable at home  Thank you for introducing new veggie ,positive,3450327
Decided to finally try out this spot since we had passed it at least once a week heading to citizen for coffee  Its hard to find parking for this little joint so you may need to walk a little but we felt it was definitely worth it  We sat at the tables outdoors where they have a nice little patio setup  The staff were very friendly and if you go for brunch you can start your day with a nice mimosa bucket  They have everything from breakfast items  sandwiches  salads  and meat entries  The food was great it tasted home grown with only the best ingredients  We will definitely be coming back in the future  only we wont wait so long this time : ),positive,832523

The concept is inventive  and the sandwich is great   The Conflict Kitchen features a simple lunch from the cuisine of a country with which the US is in conflict   The project started with Iran  and the seasoned beef sandwich served with onion  mint  and basil is worth a return visit   I cant imagine a better $5 lunch   You have about a month to enjoy it   !The sandwich comes wrapped in an interesting paper printed with comments of IranianAmericans   I found a few of the comments dubious  especially about nuclear capability   The comments appear without attribution  and I wish the authors were identified  since they are personal opinions Im looking forward to the Afghanistan offering due at the end of September   In the meantime  Im going back for more kubideh before its gone ,positive,4810986

One star because the drinks are good  However  the service here is terrible  When they released their chorizo sandwiches  I asked the barista (in the drive thru) what kind of meat was in the chorizo  He replied with uhh chorizo? Like I was the biggest idiot  I said like is it pork or beef or what? And he simply replied pork  No apology for the attitude  I then went there a couple of days later and asked for an iced caramel macchiato with coconut milk to the second line (they fill it up to the third)  she rudely replies with To the third line? With the worst sarcasm and attitude in her voice  I cannot clearly write how bad their attitudes were but they were unacceptable  I will not be going back to this Starbucks ,negative,4087257

My friend invited me to his company dinner and I was very excited to eat here  We were seated in the private room and had a couple of drinks and snacked on the complimentary bread before we placed our order  The bread was good and they served it with butter and an herb spread  We started out with calamari and oysters  The calamari was a little too rubbery for my liking and the sauce they served it with was just okay it tasted like sweet and sour  I dont eat oysters but my friend said they were fresh  For my main course I ordered halibut with shiitake mushrooms with creamed spinach  I wanted to order the chipotle macaroni and cheese and mashed potatoes but I didnt want to get too carried away  Luckily the couple next to us ordered those sides and shared it with me  The macaroni was to die for and the potatoes were really good they topped it off with a parmesan peppercorn butter  The service was great and the food was excellent its worth the price even though I didnt have to pay!,positive,3734728

I really could eat just them for the rest of my life and be eternally happy  The Smoked Vegetables did not disappoint  yummy!  The Collard Greens were the way I like them as they did not contain too much vinegar; however  for those that enjoy more Shantel did offer me vinegar if I had wanted more  Everyone at the table was really pleased with their meals  Norwood Smokehouse is definitely on my local favorites list  Enjoy!,positive,5636511

Id like to add that Autonation detailed my truck before delivery  Detailing meant spraying gallons of Armor All on every surface  The seats  The step bars  The plastic bedliner  It took an entire package of cleaner wipes to get the interior to where I could even touch it  I thought I was highly allergic to this truck but it turned out they just left the original 115 000 mile cabin air filter in place for me  7 weeks later and I still havent received my second keyfob ,negative,2886322

I had pretty high hopes for Sushi Rock  but it didnt really live up to the hype   The food was fine and the prices were acceptable  but the service left a lot to be desired   We were a table of 5 and the restaurant wasnt too busy when we were there on a Tuesday night   However  for some reason it took them eons to serve us our food   Whats worse is that everyones meals arrived at staggered times  meaning that the first person to finally receive food was made to guiltily enjoy each morsel as his ravenous friends looked on with envy   There was a gap of about 20 minutes from the arrival of the first dinner to the last  it was ridiculous  Sushi Rock should recognize that when people come to eat dinner together  theyd like to all be consuming said dinner at approximately the same time ,neutral,2147857

Wife and I both got tattoos here over the last week by Greg  The shop was very clean  staff is friendly and welcoming and the work is great  Greg is quick but meticulous  His work is amazing  Will definitely be back soon!,positive,6399521
Loved the Brazillian meat carousel! I think I died and went to heaven when I encountered the salad bar!! Grilled Portabello mushrooms  Roasted red bell peppers and sooooo so much more flavorful little scrumptious melt in my mouth items! I especially loved the rack of lamb  The meat was so tender and juicy and had the right amount of savory golden crisp glaze  on the outside! The staff was amazingly friendly and sweet  We will definitely return for an encore!Yum Yum Yummy Yum Fricken YUM!,positive,3545752

Food  Bland  flavorless  typical bar fare  (we had burgers ordered med  arrived very well)Drinks  Prices are great! Service  pretty good  kept drinks coming Overall  would stop back for drinks and to watch a game but  unless the idea is to get so drunk I forget what food is supposed to taste like  Ill pass on the eats Maybe the pizza is good? A lot of takeout customers picking up pies   ,negative,1194965

My golfing buddies and I elected to give PF Changs a try   Good decision   Started with the lettuce wraps   Always good   But  these were not quite as good as usual   The lettuce as more yellow than green  and a little on the bitter side   I had the Shrimp w/ Lobster Sauce   It was very goodan excellent blend of flavors   The other guys were very pleased with their meals and all agreed they would try Changs again   I had encouraged the guys to try the Salt & Pepper Prawns  but none did   Its one of my absolute favorite PF Changs dishes   Summary:  Very good food   Moderately priced   Excellent service   Nice decor   Whats not to love?,positive,3749513

Always goodtimes at Tryst   One of my favorite clubs in Vegas! Great crowd  vibe  and its gorgeous! Yess the waterfall view is awesome   if you can make out that way before it gets to crowded  It does get packed like sardines in there  but what do you expect for a poppin club!If ya can get a hook up for a table   just do it! It beats struggling to find a spot to chill and throwing some bows to get a drink at the bar  The club plays great music if you like the hip/hop  r&b  & some throwbacks to get ya bumpin and grindin  5 stars for Tryst   ill try the stripper pole next time P,positive,253749
I was really happy with this salon I had 2 memberships the 100 dollars a month for unlimited blowouts and the make up one for another 100 and everything was great they get appointments fast theres usually someone available so I decide to get my colour done I got an appointment with someone call Tony at 3 o clock and time went by 315 I talked to the front girls and by 330 I was done cancelled my memberships and was done about 15 minutes after I receive a phone call from them apologizing and that this stylist would give me some discount for the inconvenience well guess what is not about the money is about the time I do not know what happened if they miss the appointment or he did I wish they could just get me somebody else but at the front desk they were lost so the blowout membership totally worth  it the make up not so much dont bother in anything else this was at the tivolli village location,negative,2754012
Dont lie  you all know the colorful array of different types of M&Ms on every level of the store is why you go here  Its just so beautiful that you cant resist not going here!M&M World has everything you can ever imagine in an M&M world  From towels to mugs to plates to nametags to even customized M&Ms  I dont think there is anything this store is missing  Its a really fun place to drop by while youre in Vegas  and I think its a great place to buy souvenirs for your friends and family Some of the prices may be on the bit of a high end  but nothing TOO overpriced that you cannot afford  They also have super cute M&M shopping bags whenever you buy something from here  which youll see being held by several tourists around the Las Vegas Strip  This place is just too goshdarn popular to not see their bags being carried around Las Vegas  Definitely stop by if you have the chance!,positive,923752

Another great year for Wookstock!I manged to get there early and miss the rain   It seemed to be the same size and vendors as last year   What I would say made the difference for me this year was that the weather wasnt blazing hot like last year   The cool air made the event much more enjoyable   Also going first thing on the Saturday morning meant that the people working the booths were fresh and cheery   Also by going early  there were tons of free samples to be had   I spent some time talking to the different manufacturers and by doing so they miraculously had more samples to give me that they pulled out from behind the table   My dogs (unsuccessfully) participated in a frozen yogurt eating contest and were offered as many treats as they could eat   If I had wanted to wait in the lineups they could have had their pictures taken at many different photo booths Now that were back at home  the pups have curled up on the couch for a much deserved afternoon nap ,positive,319614
I popped in here the other weekend  I had just gotten back from a city renowned for its coffee and was looking for a decent latte This is a very nice  family run joint with some tasty looking treats  All I can speak to was the lemon bar and coffee that I consumed in a flash  and I can attest that both were quite good  Drop by if youre in the area  this seems to be a great local business that deserves the support of the community they service ,positive,2523386
I like this place due to its variety and self serve option  However  its way overpriced for one person and you got to pay for the broth separating? Its not hot pot without the soup  Typically included  I live in ville st Laurent and Im willing to drive to StMichel to eat at the other hot place any day  Food option is great and price very reasonable  2for1 deals also!Suggestion   2for1 deals might help & include the broth in ur price!,negative,2355972

This place definitely did NOT disappoint! What we ordered the first time:1 ) Garlic Prawns To die for! This is a must order EVERY SINGLE TIME!2 ) Red Chili Paste with Veggies YUM! I would go with #6 spicyness   just the right amount  3 ) Crispy Duck Penang Curry It was heavenly! Another must order dish!4 ) Seabass Drunken Noodles It was good but I can go with out  I would rather try something else Every time we are in Vegas    we always come back to Lotus of Siam and its always amazing  Advice: ALWAYS Make reservations!!,positive,5391935

I visited the Royal Ontario Museum a few years via the old entrance on Queens Park  The new cubist (or maybe glass/angular) entrance on Bloor is quite a sight to behold  So is the gift shop and the transition between the new lobby area and the brick of the old building   The restaurant area off the main lobby is also open without paying the entrance fee   I really enjoyed the feel and energy of these spaces My only quibble is the $23 entry fee for nonmembers  even though I realize that the Museum needs to pay its bills and this worldclass museum deserves our support ,positive,2683446
I truly love this museum! It is great for kids of all ages  and even I enjoy the exhibits and projects  They rotate their exhibits frequently  so there is always something new  The price is affordable and memberships are definitely worth it  especially for Mesa area residents  There are a lot of events for members  so there are a lot of perks  It is a great place to beat the heat in the summer! My tip is to avoid the first Sunday of the month  it is free on that day so it is insanely crowded  The only reason I didnt give 5 stars is because they do not have summer camps or any sort of camp for older kids or teens  Their camps are affordable  but there is nothing for kids over 9 years  which stinks for older kids who enjoy art or STEM activities  Its literally the one area they are lacking  Otherwise it is a lot of fun for everyone ,positive,2654840
Worst halal steak restaurant around!!!!! The service is terrible and the chef doesnt understand how to cook steak  I cant even describe how disappointed we were  mostly with their service as the issue was completely fixable ,negative,6441293

If I could I would give Data Doctors more than five stars  They have been my goto computer place for a couple of years and I couldnt be happier with the results every time  Robert is always so nice and helpful and patient when I ask questions  Nate came to my house to service my printer as I couldnt get it printing after buying a new computer  He not only got my printer working but did some other things that needed doing and I loved his time spent at my house  Both guys are number 1 in my book and Im hard to please  I have been on the quality care program for some time and I can highly recommend it also  They are just the best anywhere and I would recommend them to anyone  Friendly  knowledgable and efficient ,positive,3089010
So I purchased my puppy from Petland and was given a 5 day window for a check up  I heard bad things about this place but I had a great experience   The reception staff were very helpful  the Veterinarian was caring and professional  he did a great job  Wasnt notified I had to pay for the fecal test because other staff were complaining about an order of food     then called and asked for payment  hope you girls got your order fixed first ,positive,4478748
Casa Don Juan catered our going away party and I am so happy we chose them! Mirna was so helpful and easy to reach  It was a completely stress free event in regards to the food  which tasted awesome!

The pizza here is pretty good   Its the first time Ive ever had Chicagostyle pizza   I ordered it on a whim this past Saturday night because I always wanted to try it   I ordered a 10inch pizza with pepperoni   Its actually quite a bit of food  it would serve 23 people pretty easily   I phoned in my order and then headed over to pick it up   If you opt to do the same  a deep dish pizza takes about 2530 mins to make so plan accordingly   I got there early and had a beer at the bar   Bartender was very friendly and service was generally pretty good Verdict:  Definitely worth trying   Ill get food from here again ,neutral,4960136
I would overall rank this hotel as okay  Not great but definitely not the best  This is definitely not a good room for families or anyone traveling with children as across the street the large praying mantis statue intermittently plays music with loud base until about midnight  Then the hookah lounge across the street plays music until 23ish and when I say play music I mean music so loud you think you are playing it in your hotel room  I now know why the rooms have ear plugs in them  not that the ear plugs drown out the noise  Plus there is no pool  Aside from the noise  if you are younger and dont need a good nights sleep this is a great spot because so much is going on around this hotel  There is something to do for everyone  The rooms are quite outdated but they are clean and have flat screen TVs  However  there was an odd smell in the room  Overall  I would stay here again just not with my children ,neutral,2876362
Farm & Craft was an excellent choice for a night of solo dining on my recent business trip  Cool ambience  with an indoor tree as a centerpiece  and open concept!

Stopped by here for a quick minute! First time ever    Pretty cool inside  lobby area was nice and places to chill with comfy chairs   The bathroom was pretty cool too  inside the stall there is a little stand and a mirror and a nice bathroom attendant outside  The patio was really nice too  it looked like you could set up bottle service out there PLUS rent a hookah! No cover charge to get inside either  Nice!,neutral,4601806
Food is okay  not great  they add too much tip to the bill without letting you know  their service does not merit the amount they add to the bill  the tip should be earned and not demanded in a sneaky way  when I confronted the waitress about the tip and the service  she said my table was being charged tip for six adults  which wasnt true  my table had three adults only and three kids   Never will return to this restaurant ,negative,1212919
Love this place! The location  the grounds  the decor! I took part in the happy hour and the pizza and wine specials  I cant say enough about the taste of the food I had  The wines were all excellent and the service was great  The only thing that would have made this a flawless review would have been the absence of the fruit flies/nats  While I understand the wine may attract these  there was quite the infestation  All in all  I highly recommend this place!,positive,3520958
Great pizza  great prices and friendly service  Only negative was the length of time it took to get our delivery  It was worth the wait though ,positive,1528200
Was pleasantly surprised to see an affordable Italian joint in Las Vegas strip  Their lasagna was very good  Im usually quite picky with lasagna too as I had amazing lasagna on my trip to Italy  This one at Maggiano did a pretty good job at an authentic lasagna  Definitely recommend ordering this one here  Price was pretty decent too as it only cost about $11$12  Luckily even though this is a franchise  food was very authentic and it certainly didnt feel like eating at a franchise My friend ordered Chicken Florentine with Angel hair which was amazing  It was breaded chicken stuffed with spinach  parmesan cheese  and sun dried tomatoes  The angel hair pasta was in house made and it was cooked perfectly  The portions were very generous so we didnt get a chance to try the desserts but definitely would be coming back here on my next trip to Vegas!,positive,5924885

Had lunch here today with a business associate  the best Croissant chicken salad sandwich Ive had in a long time   and I do make my own   sweet tasting and excellent!  Also had an iced latte    double ristretto shot of PRESS espresso (local roaster)    great job  Loved it and my business associate was pleased as well   he had the Turkey sandwich   what was that      it was cranberry relish(?) with whipped cream on turkey   You need to try this   All in all a great meal  cafe was quiet enough to have a good conversation and the owner / host James Bernau has the energy and enthusiasm of a 11 year old boy and loves his job!  Great coffee & espresso Great lunch   If your in the neighborhood  you need to get into Play Grounds Funzone Cafe ,positive,1654978
Stopped in to pick up milk since this was the closest location  Clean store  great prices  Plus they had left over Halloween candy 50% off  we couldnt help ourselves !,positive,4619202
Pretty mediocre wings for a place called Americas best wings  They were not crispy and pretty soggy  The sauce was not very flavorful but some of the other people I ate with liked theirs  The blue cheese tastes like it came out of a bottle from the grocery store  The wings were big though I will give them that and they are not super expensive for wings  They have a lot of sauces and items on the menu  maybe they should concentrate on the wings ,neutral,4243292
I was in Cleveland and happened to see that a friends band was playing the Grog Shop  so I went to check it out  I was told that it had formerly been in a different location and had moved to the new spot in recent years  I can tell its new because its clean  its airy  it feels young  These are good thingsmost venues are filthy!I think its probably the best place to see smaller bands/underground shows in Cleveland  All the kids were out I felt old  It seemed like about 5 people were old enough to drink there  Everyone was so excited and smiling! Being from Chicago  city of apathy  it was refreshing to see  The area surrounding the Grog Shop is trying to be hip  so walk up and down the street  eat at Tommys  be young again ,positive,2728934

Saw a flyer in the mail  and found the perfect little metal table for my patio  Only $5  I could not pass that up for the low price  I had never been in a Family Dollar  and was surprised to see that they carry cosmetics  clothes  kitchen supplies  holiday decorations   pretty much everything  Even food  The items that you would expect to be expensive were extremely cheap  while other things were over priced  I am happy with my metal table though  as it was a bargain ,neutral,4384013
There is never any shortage of sub places it seems anywhere you go these days   Whats great about Daves is despite this over saturated market  they still seem to offer a unique sub experience   This place has a hippie theme going which is different than most and gives more of a one off vibe then your traditional chain restaurant   I had the Original sub and it was very tasty   It was also a good value with the price being about what you would see for that size sub   I will definitely be returning to try more subs ,positive,5075475
I have been to T  Cooks several times over the past few years both lunch and dinner   I think it is a beautiful and romantic dining experience   The food has been well prepared and presented over all of my visits although I would stop short of calling it phenomenal   I have mixed feelings on the service as I feel that some of the staff come across as a bit superior or condescending which I find  offensive   Others have been marvelous   My next goal is to stay at the resort   and have at least one dinner at T  Cooks ,positive,2226734
Do not hire Homelift Now  They caused me nothing but problems I hired them for a whole home remodel  It was supposed to take 6 weeks  6 months later still not finished  And now they wont answer calls or emails  I had to constantly have them redo work 3 or 4 times before it was even remotely acceptable  I could go on and on for pages with the problems  Just do not hire them  I would go zero stars if possible ,negative,903005

Hmm I love sushi so always willing to try a new sushi place  On a friends recent birthday we decided to stop here after enjoying Yelps happy hour at Rumor  Perhaps it was a big mistake to come to sushi hungry after indulging in quite a few drinks  Lets just say it would have been beneficial for us and our pocket books to do AYCE elsewhere  Between 3 of us  we graciously cashed out at $100 on sushi on individual rolls not AYCE  Well it wouldnt have been that bad  however  when most AYCE places are around $24 a person  it would have been cheaper to go elsewhere! The rolls were enjoyable but not mouthgasmic and overpriced  I do give them credit for surprising the birthday girl with a tempura green tea dessert  which we enjoyed greatly  Ill stick to my sushi joints off the strip ,neutral,1746547
Soooo disappointed paid almost 10 00 for a mini piece of pizza and left over salad !! I work across the street had 1/2 lunch was craving pizza so o ended going to peter piper pizza this was my second time the first time I took my family we celebrated my son birthday everything was great thats back in January 2017 today everything change to the work service and riff off ! I was also planning to speak to the manager for a party of 30 people for my 6 year upcoming birthday this month but he did not even had the time to supply me with a fork for my bit of a salad what would of they done on a birthday of 30 kids!

Solid 4 stars!Cheap good quality food  great value and you get pretty large portions for the price   Need I really say more?Everything on the menu is good but my personal favourites are the pulled pork bao  pork belly bao and kimchi fries  They usually make everything fresh and hot to order   I also love the carrots and fresh cilantro they add to every dish   You cant go wrong at Bahn Mi Boys!

I thought this Hilton hotel was beautiful!  The staff were also very friendly  The list goes on with the friendly things they did to make our stay pleasant  1  They opened the doors for us and greeted everyone when we came and went  2  They offered free coffee and fruit flavored water in the lobby every morning  One evening when they were out of water the receptionist even offered me a free bottle of water  3  Another evening they were handing out free cookies that I took up to my room to enjoy  Our hotel room was nice as well  We had a coffee maker and tea bags which is always a plus  The only downside was there were too many kids at the pool and I wanted to swim a little  Cant blame them for wanting to splash around in the pool on a hot day though ,positive,2634735
Worst place ever! Terrible CS  they dont even know how to prepare a good drink  I been there just a few times  hoping they have better service or new employees maybe  unfortunately they havent  today I have to asked them to redo my order  The rude Manager with an annoying voice always treated me very unprofessional today   If I have the option to write a review rating your place at zero I will be much happier however  your place deserve less then that!,negative,6443957

My wife and I have been here a few times  We really liked our dinner from the previous time (sorry  no review)  so we thought wed give it try again  This time it was for the fish fry and beer  We both ordered the same thing  the fried haddock with the salad bar  Comes with the choice of potato and salad bar  The salad bar was actually really good with a wide variety of toppings for your salad and  and  and warm delicious breadsticks  Our server was fantastic  Brought me a sample of the featured $4 beer  It was pretty good but I decided to go with the pale ale  My wife had an old fashioned  which she said was good  Overall  the breading on the fish was nice and crispy  light and honestly not too greasy  Coleslaw was the way I like it and the tartar sauce was fantastic  had a little fresh herb taste to it  The fries were good  Everything was good  Nice atmosphere  The place was packed (Badgers basketball was on too)  but plenty of leg and arm room  Wed definitely go back ,positive,3827860

No room serves no balcony had to go 20 flights down just to smoke  Not one of my favorites for it to be an MGM property came saw didnt not like so I will not come to stay again  However left my hair bag in my room was able to call and retrieve my belongs so that was cool ,negative,3906726
This is my favorite restaurant  Not just for Ethiopian  but my overall favorite restaurant  Very affordable and just really delicious food  I would eat here every week if it were close to my house  Im very excited that theyve started selling some of their dishes at Whole Foods now  particularly my favorites: misir wat  tikil gomen  and fosolia ,positive,5280056
We came here for a late dinner and were able to snag seats at the bar despite the wait  My boyfriend got the chipotle glazed ribeye  he rarely orders steak out because its often nothing too special  but he was a huge fan  I ordered the tiger shrimp and corn tamale app for a light meal and it was perfect  I dont know if I could come back and get anything else  We felt that all of the food was worth the money spent ,positive,5964803

Bulk Barn is a saviour  Buy just what you need  What a concept! Even though Im a longtime fan of Costco which uses the opposite concept to Bulk Barn  both business models combine to complete your shopping needs and help make you less dependent on the high priced stores like Loblaws nearby If you are walking by  a look inside is recommended  Slowly go through the aisles from front to back and see what they have for your future needs  You could be surprised!For people who love to bake home made goodies  this is the perfect spot to buy what you need  Making chocolate chip cookies? They have the chips  including different varieties of them  Check it out!,positive,605183
The store is stocked with a decent supply of quick items when you dont want to go to a larger store  but its parking lot usually deters us from stopping in  Its usually crowded with panhandlers and scary folks glaring at you from some sort of a stooper that makes the experience feel so unsafe!,negative,5026471
Authentic  homemade delicious food  As soon as you step in  you feel the unassuming  modest vibe going on here  And thats what makes it so special  The proof is in the pudding  or  the broth rather  I had the spicy pork ramen  and I am shocked that something so spicy could still end up tasting so delicious ,positive,383331
Went here to have my charger port on my Galaxy S4 fixed  It took the guy 10 minutes to fix and out the door i went  Really fast service i was highly impressed  Bring cash because running debit or credit they charge 3%   ouch! The guy was nice and waved the fee   I would definitely go back for any cell phone repairs the guy was very knowledgeable  Also make sure you know its suite 15  there is no marquee  with the business name on it  Its in between a Mediterranean restaurant and TCs Rib Crib ,positive,6242614

Decent enough space  Food came fast  youll see why   I had HRC breakfast  3 over easy eggs  bacon  hash browns  sausage  toast  Eggs were way undercooked  whites very runny  Hash browns were extremely undercooked  brown on outside  barely cooked on the thick inside  Toast was barely toasted  No wonder it came out fast  Husband had Greek omelet  Very bland  Barely any feta cheese  Kids had strawberry pancakes which means pancakes with some cut strawberries on top  Werent very tasty  Server was nice enough  but obviously overworked as she rushed through everything and the waist for our check was extremely long  The prices were high for crappy food and barely any service  Go somewhere else ,negative,825318
Ive never physically been here  But we order lunch from here at work  Its always A LOT of food at ok prices for what youre getting  Not the healthiest choice  but its amazingly delicious! I will probably find myself heading in there with friends and family soon ,positive,3063975
When I walked in they sat me in a chair  my feet soaking for a good 20 minutes while the manager ran around trying to figure out how to help me  The manager ended up doing my pedicure  Stones were cold  didnt do a good job on callus removal and I had 3 people sitting next to me with feet in water with not enough employees but they dont want to turn away business so they stick you in a chair with water forever which turns cold  Def dont recommend So  I came back for a second chance  Same thing  I called and they said they could get me right in  Came in  Sat in the chair for 25 minutes  Management sucks  They run around like they dont know what they are doing  Seriously dont come here ,negative,6350775
A super Starbucks for a date  its an easy walk from all the restaurants and hangouts in the shopping center  My wife and I have stopped in here a bunch of times In the mornings  this place is wall to wall with people waiting for the coffee fix  Expect a queue of 6 to 8 people  but the crew here seems to get it done fast  efficient and friendly Very few seats inside and a couple of tables outside  Not really much of a hangout ,positive,122676

Neat little place  Coffee was okay  I asked for soy milk but got whole milk Instead (lactose intolerant)  I did not like the coffee here  tasted like any other low quality coffee shop  Iam a coffee lover and enjoy nice fresh espresso beans  this isnt the place for me  Good service  cashier was nice and helpful ,negative,3849921

Well  I guess it is about time to update this review and add a star because you can tell that these guys have gotten a working system down  They continue to show up somewhat regularly on Thursdays at Hayden Ferry office complex and when they do I always get a bowl of Ramen  Hot and delicious  you can tell they put a lot of care into their product  The wait times are not as bad it used to be  And I appreciate the new bowls so that I dont burn my hands trying to carrying it back to my office ,positive,6204561
We came here for a lunch buffet and it was $39 a person  I am not sure how some other reviewer paid only $35 a few days before us (12/26/2013)  The good thing about this place is the decoration  Other than that everything about the food sucks  There is no barely any choice for main dish such as sirloin steak or Korean BBQ   There is no seafood at all; no crab  no mussel  no squid  The sushi station is horrible and they have California roll and spider roll only  The California roll was made with imitation crab meat  They serve scramble egg for lunch  Who would want to eat that at 5 star hotel? In summary  overpriced food and lack of variety to eat and cheap food not fit for a 5 star hotel  I will never come here again for the food ,negative,5964876
A show u can enjoy last minute  Its cheap compared to other big shows  tickets are easy to find  and small theater so it pretty cool  There was archer lady in the middle of show which kind was not syn with rest of the plot  but ok overall ,positive,119732
This used to be a decent place for some cheap chinese food  Not anymore  The last time I ordered their fried chicken  there was not ONE piece of meat in it  and nothing but fried dough on chicken skin  I left with such a disgusting taste in my mouth  never again ,negative,5609914
Great location  Love the industrial feel of the place and the staff really take the time to explain coffee selections  The Motown french press was pretty smooth but did have a slightly bitter aftertaste  Their daily medium roast coffee was a little stronger than expected  but still good  But overall  if you drink black coffee  not bad in terms of flavor  Loved the two stories  Definitely gave more privacy to the place I will say that the most annoying thing about this place was the amount of gnats flying around  I had to fight them off to even drink my coffee  There were even some flying around the food counter waiting for the opportune moment to advance  Overall decent coffee  but the gnats drove me crazy enough that I had to take this into account when reviewing ,neutral,1515134
Terrible company  The salesperson was excellent  and great moving men  but the customer service dept was a nightmare  After they lost the paperwork and didnt schedule my move when they were supposed to  a call to the president led only to him lying to me   even though I had paperwork in front of me  Delays cost me a lot of $  and the lies continued for months  I was even charged for storage fees for the time they couldnt find my furniture  Dont use these people,negative,4692131
We are very happy with this company!

OMG! I cant believe they opened a JJs in Tempe!! I was so thrilled to see it while driving on Mill  This place used to be my fav spot when I was in Charleston  IL for high school So I had to stop to just get the taste of home that I missed for so long (since 2005)  and decided to order my usual  the Turkey Tom  The sandwich was simple  bread was soft  and ingredients were fresh!!! I just felt healthier than eating burger and fries  (btw  the Pepe is really good too!)Will definitely keep going back :),positive,3978653

Im going to give this a 5Food great I was impressed with the serving size and I loved they gave me an adequate amount of sour cream  Service excellentSeated fast  we got our dinner in less then 10mi  Our server made sure our drinks were always full as well as our chip bowl and he was friendly   We were in a little rush that light and we were in and out within 30min The only thing that would make it better would be more booths and they should paint the ceilings black so its a little darker   just offering a better atmosphere,positive,2920816
Dr  Hawkes was born to take care of animals  We found her long ago when to needed a new vet to help our nervous dog Molly  Dr Hawkes figured out how to cut Mollys nails! ( Believe me  this is miraculous) Dr H  has  also cared for our familys many other dogs over the years  She has a warm personality and great sense of humor Plus  she has been a wonderful role model for my youngest daughter  who talks often about being a vet  just like Dr  Hawkes!We recently lost  Molly at home  age 15    I stopped in to get meds for the other dogs and saw Dr  H  through  the reception window  She came out to the waiting room  gave me a hug  and started to cry  Wow  We met Dr  Hawkes when the previous vet screamed at me after Molly bit her  peed  and pooped on the awful metal table during a traumatic manicure  Molly was difficult  for sure  So we are extra thankful for a compassionate and intelligent person like Dr  Keri Hawkes ,positive,942563
I adore this park which is very close to my place  It has lovely  tall trees  an artificial lake with ducks and a pretty fountain  sloping land around it to relax on  And yes squirrels  birds  bugs and all that fun stuff! Besides being great for walks  and picnicking  its a very well used park and you get a communal vibe every time you pass through  People make music here  sunbathe  drink wine and do juggling  yoga  etc  Being spacious it does not feel crowded  Theres an enclosure to let dogs run around  sports areas  a cultural and exhibition space and an open air theatre  which has wonderful free events in summer  And now they have opened a chic little restaurant as well  I cannot rave enough about this gem so close to downtown  which used to be a farm in the past ,positive,1826602
I had a wonderful experience at MD Laser  I have been wanting lip injections for quite a while but was very reluctant  as I did not want to look fake or overdone  Yuliana took the time to answer all of my questions and made sure to take the time to understand the look I was going for with my lips  During the procedure she was always checking in with me  making sure I was okay  which made the whole process much more comfortable  I was speechless with the results! She did an amazing job acheiving the natural look I was going for while still adding volume  I am so happy with my results and this spa and I will be coming back for any future procedures  Highly recommend to anyone in the Las Vegas area!,positive,2122554

Terrible service   Stay away from this place   Paid over $500 for a battery   Received a call from the service man Chad and he said the car was ready to be picked up   I went to pick up my car then had to wait over 30 mins for them to bring it out to me    I had to ask several times for them to bring the car out and the girl at the cashier desk just said  were busy and we are under staffed  Also they said they would wash the car but then when the car was finally brought to me it was not washed   I inquired as to why and the attendant said   the car wash is broken  I thought that was crazy since the girl at the cashier had just said the car was washed    This business has no idea what they are doing    I wont be going back ,negative,4699488

Potstickers were very salty  ice tea was served in thick plastic glasses  udon seafood soup had very little seafood  Seating area alongside the wall has cracked dingy looking cover which should have been replaced a while ago  Their special rolls are too pricey for the amount of fish they have in them  Service was OK  I will not return and I do not see how any sushi lover can rate this place high  I am giving 3 stars hoping they can improve and recover when in reality I feel it was 2 star dining experience ,neutral,4229397
Ive used many landscapers over the years  but Carlos and Land tech were absolutely the best  The design and execution were above and beyond our expectations  They were there at the start time they said and finished 2 days ahead of schedule  We were so impressed  with the job they did  we hired them for all our yard maintenance  I would highly recommend this company for all your landscaping needs ,positive,3080310

If I could give this place no stars I would    customer service is so key these days when there are so many nail places to choose from  I received a gift card for this place and thought I had mistakenly thrown it away  I just found it while cleaning out a closet  I was excited to go use the gift card and realized it had an expiration date from 1 year the date it was purchased  The lady would not honor it despite me saying I would get more services than the gift certificate was allotted for  I did mention that she did in fact receive the money for the gift card and although I realized it was expired  I still feel cheated  I was honest and not trying to take advantage but I believe the lady could have been more understanding  What a disservice to the customer!,negative,3098643

Went to Joes the first night of my trip for a friends birthday dinner  Our server was very knowledgable and on point with her suggestions  For appetizers we tried the ceviche which was delicious and we all ordered a cup of the creamy crab bisque  Oh my goodness this was the best tasting soup Ive ever had in my 24yrs Dinner I order a combination of a petite filet mignon and kind crab legs  The crab was fresh and delicious and dont get me started on that filet  Perfectly cooked and so tender  Melted in your mouth like butter  Our server gave us a complimentary brownie for my friends birthday which was a nice ending to the meal Overall it was one of the best meals that Ive had in a while and Im glad to know there is one in Chicago!,positive,6275405
Great things weve tried: the roasted chicken  the Guinness stew  Irish spring rolls  fish and chips  The desserts are very good as well so far  Weve tried the sticky toffee pudding and the English toffee pie  The only thing I dont like is the tartar sauce that comes with the fish ansd chips  Very much of an olive/caper flavor   which I dont like  Great atmosphere with friendly  helpful staff  Patio looks like it will be great once it warms up!,positive,1600668

This location is convenient to home for me located within the Hilton Garden Inn  Friendly service and typically the food is decent  This past visit they got everything wrong  although it was rung up correctly on the receipt  Unfortunately by the time I got home and realized the order was wrong  they were closed when I called back  (Closed at 2pm due to the holiday)  Very disappointing with the lack of attention to detail Ill be back but will be sure to check everything before leaving with a takeout order ,negative,5371087

Simply amazing  We sat outside on a beautiful day  I ordered a Thyme after Thyme cosmo and I couldnt get enough! Although I could tell which bartender made which drink  There were only 2 bartenders  My first drink was made by the female   first one was pink  had squeezed lemon  frothy and thyme   the second time it was a different color pink  no froth  no thyme or lemon  When I asked for a new one I asked if the male made my second one and the waitress said yes   so I asked if the female could make it and Id patiently wait for it  Matt got an old fashion  also made by the girl  His second one came back and it was a completely different color  Before the waitress sat it down she mentioned it looked different and it also didnt have the cherry in the second time around  In conclusion The food was great! The deviled eggs were amazing! Id go back again!,positive,4447256

Im going to have to say that maybe my tastes are heavy but it was definitely a nifty fast food but more awesome type of dining experience   They do super healthy shakes and food and have some great and unique selections that has opened my eyes to a different array of tastiness   I got some quinoa noodles with some other fillings and was really surprised about the healthiness taste   Perhaps I craze the butter and salt but this was wonderful food for the healthy and fit conscious such as myself   I know I should eat good and this place could and will inspire someone to take the simplicity home and do it!!!  The price points are a bit steep but a new restaurant/swing in always has some growing pains and with time I think this place will definitely ramp up   Ill be back fooooooooo sho and try the smoothies next time!!!,positive,2921097
The staff here is AMAZING!We went in basically 2 minutes before closing and they were so warm and caring  I let them know it was my birthday the week prior and they gave me a bundtlet!

The Dane has the best beer in town  For that reason alone you should check it out  It also has a great outdoor area in the back when it is warm enough outside  Sometimes I believe the servers think the beer sells itself and therefore could care less about giving good service  Unfortunately they might be right  The food is good but not great ,positive,4733707

Was so excited to have dinner at Sirio during a recent trip to Vegas   We were staying in the Aria and had tickets to Zarkana that night so we were looking for something close   We made a reservation and our table was ready for us when we arrived   We were given the wine list right away   The wine was definitely overpriced   The prices on their wines dont seem to match the prices of their food   Because it was so expensive  we decided to skip on the wine   Once we told them that we didnt want any wine our service went from good to bad   We placed our order  and didnt see our waiter until the food came out   They dropped off our food then we didnt see them again until we asked for our bill   The food was not bad  but not great either  and the portions were very small  especially for the price   If you are looking for Italian  I would skip Sirio and try something else ,negative,5927289
The Marquee is THE place to go! We went on Presidents Day and arrived shortly before 10:30 pm  The line wasnt horribly long  about a 2 minute wait while other patrons paid their entrance   MARCO  YOU ARE GREAT ! one of the promoters for the club  got us in  He was very friendly and constantly checking in with us to make sure we were having a good time   The music was fantastic   We had been to The Rok the night before and were completely impressed with The Marquee   The security was very friendly  even with all their Men in  Black gear (black on black suits with ear pieces)   I do have to agree with the the other review that mentioned the stairs  as this was the only way out and there were at least 5 flights of stairs to climb to make it to the exit   Customer service is great  music is great! TOTALLY COMING BACK next time Im in Vegas!,positive,4744941

They also made no effort to make sure she was okay despite being violently ill in the bathroom  Extremely poor customer service and there are health risks at this restaurant  None of my friends will be returning ,negative,2830046

Sacks is near to my work place   They serve the best ever chipotle chicken sandwich ever !! I come down thinking to try something else  but mostly end up ordering my favorite again  Am sure all their other menu tastes great  Cheers to Sacks !!,positive,4368149
Great food and healthy! We had the cheese bread and gluten free pizza and it was delicious!! Great customer service! The only problem was the price of the pizza  $19 for a 12in pizza!!,positive,1469642
Ordered 2 pizzas  breadsticks and cookie desert    After 1 hour and 45 min of waiting for my food I called to check up on it and was told they were backed up  When I asked to speak with the manager  I was told she (Shelly) was too busy to come to the phone  Completely unacceptable  Poor poor customer service  They offered me a $20 credit on my next order    Lol save the credit because I wont ever be ordering from here again  Ever ,negative,4101859
This is a great burger joint  Had the 100% Arizona grassfed beef burger with some toppings on the freshbaked bun  One of the best burgers I have ever had! The ambience is clean though not fine dining  but if youre looking for a great burger  you may not be looking for white table clothes anyway  I know that my wife and I were not  The owner/manager came over to check on us and I was quick to point out that it was one of my favorite burgers ever  Also  cooked to a perfect medium  The French fries are worth mentioning as well   you know  fresh cut slightly crispy on the outside  potatoy on the inside  And for those not wanting meat  my wife highly recommends the white and black bean burger  made fresh locally!,positive,5211568
If I could have given this gym zero stars I would have  The gym is mediocre  but the true problem with this facility is the gross misrepresentation their employees use  I was told that I was signing up for a one year contract  and in fact  I could not afford a longer one; however  I found later that the employee signed me up for a two year contract and was forced to pay an atrocious fee to cancel the account  I have nothing goo to say about the establishment and will tell everyone I know how awfully I was treated by the people at this gym  Just  Awful ,negative,3100882
First off Tina M is not telling it like it is at The Place at Sonoran Trails   The $9 she mentioned  as insurance that didnt cover her property was to allow her to move in without a huge depositThere were no hidden fees as she states I recently moved into them   As far as renters insurance its common for apartments to cover their losses if an accident occurs   I think the layouts of the apartments is great and I love it   If you notice all of the other reviews are 5 star so pleas disregard Tina ,positive,1138557
Really a very nice facility with courteous staff  Good fitness machines  Clean showers  I went during summer time to use the outdoor pool  Not exactly a well thought out plan on my part  Nice pool for the kiddos  but only three lanes for lap swimming  The other factor was that the lap and recreational pool are joined and share water  Everybody knows what occurs in any public pool with young bladders  The lap area was seriously murky  I had hoped it was caused by sunscreen  but that just wasnt likely  I did see the staff testing the pH in the water  but I didnt want to risk it ,neutral,4293103
If there was a zero star review thats what I would give them! Very rude customer service before I even started to order I walked out! How can u enjoy a meal when spoken to so rudely!,negative,3113340
I was really looking forward to a girls night with some friends so we came to Dave and Busters for happy hour food  drinks  and games  When we arrived it took us about 40 minutes before a waitress approached us and then another 30 minutes to get our drinks  We had to flag down another waitress to even get a second drink which took us an hour to get after the first one  Since it took us about two hours to get our drinks  we didnt even have time to play any games before they closed at midnight  To top it off  drinks werent strong at all and we ended up leaving for a different bar  We definitely will not be returning any time soon ,negative,2754790

This place is hit or miss   The 1st time I went  it was a great experience   I was able to walk in (without an appointment) and get a gel manicure and a pedicure   Libby was my technican  and she was fabulous  5 stars!!!!  The manicure was great  and lasted the full two week as promised (would have lasted longer but it grew out too much and I started picking at it )  My pedicure is still going strong after two weeks and looks great So I went back  And I had a different person (I dont know her name )  Well  lets just say that my hands still hurt a day later!  She cut my nails unevenly (some are rounded  some are squared)  and the polish is uneven as well and poorly applied at the edges   My cuticles hurt to high heaven  and my nails are too short  1 star!!!  Im only going back only if I can get an appointment with Libby    5 stars for Libby  but overall 2 stars  because I think that a salon should be able to provide consistent service ,negative,5481973
Was very happily surprised    for a small little Chinese Restaurant it was quite good and a perfect size for lunch   Due to dietary restrictions  I cant eat the rice or Lomein and they were very kind to exchange a few steamed green beans with no extra charge!  Thats true customer service    Thank You!Ill be coming again!!!,positive,5930829
I went there last year for dinner  baseball game  It was great! both the experience and the food  A home run ball hit my window scared the shit out of me  too bad I couldnt catch it :D  So I went back again with another friend  both of us love the food  It was absolutely delicious and the plates were heated to preserve the temperature of the food  The service was as good as their food  she was polite and professional  I will definitely go back again with friends!,positive,2814022
I love this place during the holidays   Sure there is a large crowd (so if you dont like those  go early) but these guys pull the stops to dress up the entire space and keep kids of all ages engaged in aesthetics and education   We will definitely go back for Halloween   Maybe check out the Easter scene for next year (which sucked at Ethel M Botanical gardens)   Pics Please! http://www yelp com/biz_photos/springspreservelasvegas?selectAbXVuW15cDreljppZ6s4MA#AbXVuW15cDreljppZ6s4MA,positive,2434518
Well     just went last night hoping the new owner has wised up even though modern cuisine in the western environment of Cave Creek seemed a long shot   This place will never survive   It has gone progressively down hill over the last 5 years    I live here!!  A real shame since I knew it as s great steak & seafood ranch house restaurant under previous owner   Why change it?!  Service staff seem to be unhappy & of the caliber of Dennys or IHOP   not knowledgeable & the food is worse  Overpriced and decorative SMALL portions   If I pay $30 for salmon  I expect it to be the dominant item on the plate   not the unidentifiable vegetable & a heavy sauce!  Shame on me for wasting time & money giving this establishment a second & third chance! Never again!!!,negative,6210633
First off  I love that fact that the staff is open and friendly  But what sold me was the roasted chicken  I know  I know  chicken is for those who dont know what to get  But Im so glad my wife got the chicken which was recommended by a couple on the next table  It was absolutely fantastic!!! I never experienced chicken whose texture was so luscious and smooth   I still dream of the next time I can go back and order it all for myself   Also  Anthony Bourdain had to admit that the french fries at Bouchon rival his fries  and he thinks he has the best fries this side of the Atlantic!  Well worth the money!,positive,1140789

Guys  if you want to spend a cool holidaysplease  stay away from this horrible place  Probably thats why its so cheapthey dont care about u  but its ok  First of all whey treat you like a sh*t  We had a problem with deposit (what was their fault at allthey forgot to take it during check in)  so after the second night they just sent a security to us to follow him   Then we solved it I jumped like a goat to reception and back for the new key 4 times cos it was impossible to open our door  Im pretty sure they did it specially  My friend was sitting on the floor and studying  she had a online lessons and it was impossible to enter our paid room) after more that hour they sent a security finally  who was totally rude  Like he gave a favor to us  No one during all of this time said elementary Sorry  they just dont care  And also   towels were dirty  thanx god we saw it before  If u want to destroy your weekendthis shitty hostel will be there best choice for you!,negative,1616871
Been here on many occasions as this location is literally down or up the street from my home  This location is always packed to where cars are parked along the sidewalks  especially for happy hour  I was here for a family event! Had a nice time on a weeknight and had myself two tasty beef tacos with Spanish rice  The margarita was not the best tasting  but no complaints from me being I had to work the next day!,neutral,475531

Adorable board game cafe located conveniently in the fashion district  For $7  you can play for as long as you want  The staff here are fantastic and will walk you through any game you want to play  Theres no outside food/drinks allowed in here  but they do have a select menu of snacks  sandwiches  and drinks  The food here is prepackaged snacks youd find at any grocery store  so Id recommend eating before you come  Gratuities are added to your bill for groups with more than 6!,positive,172836
This is the best game store in Madison  It has great prices  Better trade in prices than preplayed or GameStop  I have been going there for about 7 years and there has always been great deals  Great place to go if you are looking for retro games,positive,5335447
Treating your Pitt student to breakfast or brunch at Pamelas is a time honored tradition!  Your student will appreciate the huge servings of delicious comfort food  and you will appreciate the moderate prices (but remember  it is cash only)  Definitely try the some of their famous crepe pancakes!  They are thin  crispy around the edges  and the size of a dinner plate  The strawberry stuffed ones are the best  This location is right in the midst of Pitt campus and so is always crowded with college students  However  dont be put off by the wait  service is fast and the tables turn over quickly  The ambiance is casual  colorful and fun  with old board game boxes and gameboards decorating the walls   Recommend!,positive,5716043
We got a Joanna pizza to go  Pizza was good  One pizza fed two adults  They are about the size of maybe a medium  Atmosphere inside was nice  I will be back ,positive,5998862
The food that I got was phenomenally made (Baja fish tacos with a little lime for zest!) but the service was on the poorer side  I definitely would rate this higher if we only looked at food With more than one person serving our table  we had to repeatedly ask for refills on drinks or condiments  We also werent given any water at our table until asked  I understand that it can get busy especially during lunchtime but I wish we were more attended to ,neutral,4871654
If you like beers  this is place to go  They have tons of selection  We usually do the flight where we pick 6 types to taste before committing to a pint  Their menu pair well with the beers  They have limited parking  one TV and an open flow to the patio  Its a great place to meet up with a group of friends but it can be very loud and echoie ,positive,3136756
Ive never made it here for breakfast  but I have had their sandwiches  and they are fantastic  The restaurant itself is divided into two pieces: the bakery on one and the deli/kitchen on the other  I havent been able to try out any of the sweets yet but they look pretty good  and if the rest of the food is any indicator they probably are  I dropped in for a fast lunch and got a honey ham sandwich the other day and it was delicious  It was almost the sensation I had with Matts Big Breakfast that how good can a ham sandwich be? but then they surprise you utterly and pleasantly  The principal difference between here and a place like Matts is bang for your buck  The food is very good at Country Glazed Ham but you dont feel like youre getting away with a steal like at some of the hole in the wall gems around  It is cozy and accommodating and never hard to find a good seat  The staff is also consistently friendly and helpful ,positive,3063854
Im not judging this on the coffee at all   this 2 stars goes to how slow this place is  I was once in the drivethru for 20min    when we pulled up  they gave us the coffee for free   Ever since it seems I average 10min per visit   Thats hella long  TIP:  If you are going in the mornings before work  DO NOT use the drive thru     go inside  its much faster ,negative,3168691

This place is fantastic and would be a welcomed addition to any major city food scene  The butter poached lobster was rich and delicious but the real star for me was the duck a lorange  Ive never had a duck breast so tender  moist  and flavorful  The table ordered the Branzino as an app to share and it was perfect!  The service was excellent; warm  courteous  and accommodating  I cannot say enough good things about Bruneaux and am excited to return on our next trip through Pittsburgh!,positive,5466774

Tradesmans Tavern had that  typical Ohio neighborhood pub feel to it  but roomy because its a good size place  Choose to sit on a bar stool at the large bar in the center of the room or at one of several  tables all around  There is also a nice size outdoor patio with its own bar  Servers are friendly  Prices are really beyond reasonable!Whats anything but typical is the food   This is better than regular bar food   A house side salad is plentifully served on a dinner plate & was really nice  not just bagged lettuce tossed on a plate  I ordered the wings  10 for $5 and they were tasty  moist & meaty   Several different rubs to choose from & the garlic parmesan was a good choice  Friends ordered the burgers & all were happy  Drinks also reasonably priced  All in all its a good place for friends to meet & enjoy without spending a fortune ,neutral,5713866
Its pretty amazing that you can play were the pros play   We played here on Sunday on a golf package that I booked with the JW Marriott located within minutes of the course  We teed off around 10:00 am and we never saw anybody behind us the entire day  We finally caught a group in front of us around the 16th hole so it was enjoyable not playing with groups stacked on top of each other  The course was decent but for being a TPC course I was disappointed in the maintenance of the course  It seems like the course must of got to much recent play and I noticed it  Fairways are all pretty wide and the slope was not that tough from the mixed tee box  Greens were a 11 on the stimpmeter so they were fast but rolled true  The practice facility here is very good including the driving range  chipping area and practice putting greens  I would probably play here again but would not pay the regular rack rate which is $169 00 per player for this time of year ,positive,3275374

Eh   Ive experienced better 1) I thought this would be a classy place  but was corrected when I walked in and was seated next to a couple with a 2 yr old for our 8:30PM reservation  No offense to the kid  but not when Im trying to have a nice night out  There were also 2 large parties of barely21 year olds who were loud and firsttimers in Vegas  Just killed my impression of a classy Vegas dinner 2) The food was good  but not amazing  Vegas has a ton of AMAZING restaurants so theres no need to settle for just good 3) It was so loud in here! They had music playing and maybe because of that people felt the need to speak louder but it was so disturbingly loud  But   I did enjoy the fries  They got good fries ,negative,977871

Definitely my favorite place to get Vietnamese food  Some other places offer great pho  but not much else after that  Other places offer not so great pho  while offering other great Vietnamese dishes  This place offers both  The pho especially has great broth  which is served piping hot  And the portions are pretty decent for the prices  The restaurant itself is pretty clean as well  something you might not find at other establishments  Service is a hit or a miss for me though  80% of the time service is better than most other establishments  The other 20% isnt bad service  just mediocre  Theyre pretty fast and attentive  but few speak English  Dont forget o get Vietnamese coffee when you go  p,positive,842978
I love the Mirage! I am not a regular in Vegas  but I just might be after staying at the Mirage  First of all  their gimmic is the best in Vegas  tropical oasis  The hotel is full of tropical plants  flowers  and flowing water  this appeals to me more than pirates  fake NYC  and the beendone italian/roman look  Japonais is a restaurant/lounge with great sushi  drinks  ambiance  The best was Bare  the adult only  european style pool  So fun!

Worst wax experience Ive ever had in my life!!!! I went here earlier this month  I had been waxed before multiple times at the body waxing studio  but I needed something fast and got a groupon for this place  I got a Brazilian  underarm  and full legs  The brazilian was THE WORST! She use soft wax and was pulling the sheets straight up and wasnt pressing on the skin at all  She went over the hair on the lips multiple times with the wax and ended up ripping my skin off! After a couple days I had a huge scar  I had to have her stop because it was way too painful and have a man come in to use hard wax  That hard wax was way too hot and when I told them that they did nothing about the temperature  To top it of she put CUTICLE OIL on my intimate area  LITERALLY THE WORST PLACE FOR A WAX!,negative,6449641

I got completely hammered here on New Years Eve 2010  My friends convinced me to wear this low cut dress to the party  and I wound up getting molested by an old man     so I slapped him in the face  pushed him into his goon friends and called for security  The place was completely packed  so when security came they pushed the old creep through the crowd  Everyone was throwing stuff at him  It was bliss  :)The bartenders saw the whole thing happen  and helped with security as best they could  They even gave my whole crew free drinks! For being a busy night on New Years Eve  the staff conducted themselves with great poise and professionalism ,positive,2088596

Looking for a quick bite to eat in Paris at noon isnt ideal  Our friends settled to line up in for crepes and we decided to try out Cafe Belle Madeleine  I saw they had Chicken Mushroom pie aka Chicken Friand at La Madeleine in Houston  so I was super excited until I asked the customer service lady if it comes with mushroom gravy and she advised no  She did ask if we wanted it heated up and she did  I also bought a Chef salad sure to the large amount of bacon  small Cafe Latte  and the Tiramisu in the chocolate bowl  The salad was as expected  I didnt expect much from a machine for the latte  and the Tiramisu was spongy enough although really sweet  Maybe not enough coffee??? I guess Im spoiled when it comes to French cuisine  Great effort cafe Belle Madeleine!,neutral,3459428

We were being transferred from Houston to Phoenix over the summer and had very limited time to see houses much less figure out where to live   Over the course of 2 days in my first visit to the area   We saw 1215 homes and he was able to figure out exactly what I liked and didnt like    and even helped with schools!  He was so personable and never pushy or tried to get us to like houses over our budget When we came back 4 weeks later to do the final house visit we once again spent 3 days with him  seeing 20 homes and narrowing out selections down to our top 3   Once we picked our first choice he did a great job of handling out of state negotiations and inspections as well as getting things like the pool fixed and other items on the inspectors list!After seeing 47 houses in total in the heat of July and never losing his cool (even when he left his entry code gadget at home one day) I would use him for my next house in an instant!!!,positive,6156384
their dim sum is so so  i do come here when i want dim sum but if i wanted to work harder for better food id drive somewhere else  they do have good food that isnt dim sum tho  i frequently come here to order hainan chicken and their roast duck over rice  it is a good portion and very delicious  they also make it really quick so if i order to go  i dont have to wait very long there to get my order  they speak english very well here and i have never had them get my order wrong when i ask for substitutions and add ons  i am very pleased with the service here as well  you can see all the hanging chicken and duck in front as well as see them cut up the chicken and duck too!,positive,6639626
Attended a Yelp event at Bandit Brewery and enjoyed the lovely ambiance  outdoor patio and delicious food  They converted a garage into a brewery but kept the open feel of the garage  Their beer of course was also very interesting and had unique flavours that I havent seen at other breweries  There was a sour beer  made sour from apricots out of all things that was so different than anything I tried before  I also loved the raspberry flavoured beer  perfect for a summer evening  The snacks that were offered were also delicious  I enjoyed their steak on crusty bread with chimichuri sauce and tuna & dill mix on cucumbers  I would love to come back to enjoy their full menu and spend another summer evening on their patio!,positive,378699
Obviously not so much a secret anymore  but still a good place to drop in for a slice if youre in Vegas or at least exploring (or partying on) the grounds of the Cosmopolitan  The whole hidden thing still gives it an appealing quality  If you havent been in yet  its on the third level across from the pool table lounge area  The dark corridor leading into the light of the hole in the wall pizza joint is a pretty sweet introduction to the place  Slices are pricey  but I doubt the majority of their clientele cares much about that so long as they can feed the drunken hunger  The pizza is really good  though  and it wont take long for you to start stuffing your mouth with it after ordering  It seems small  but theres still enough space to work around the crowds when eating your slice and drinking your beer ,positive,3984956
My friend told me that I must try this place and I popped by today  I have to say after today  this is my favorite dessert place I have egg and dairy allergy  as well as gluten sensitivity  Yet most gluten free vegan desserts offered in the market are filled with tons of processed ingredients and sugars Patchmont Thai Dessert is the best  I appreciate their fresh and natural ingredients  Their variety of vegan and gluten free steamed desserts reminds me of South East Asia   very fragrant  Not too sweet Oh  their curry puffs are mouthwatering delicious  it is not gluten free but is vegan Must try!!,positive,3735913

Just as great as the other location  but closer! I got a caramel latte (not on the menu but they were able to do it!) and it was delicious! Service was super fast! The brewista noticed that my friends didnt like their drinks (not because they were bad but because they were trying new things) and came over and offered to remake them at no extra charge! So awesome of him to make sure we liked what we got! Will definitely be coming back a lot!,positive,3321245
Went to a play date here today  The kids had a blast! My LO is really too young for the big play area so we stayed in the toddler zone most of the time  She really enjoyed the bounce house  They had a nice little snack bar  The staff was very courteous and great with kids  When one of them saw I had a crawler that picked up some paper on the ground  he immediately got another staff member to vacuum  There were a lot of parents that were NOT watching their kids  but thats to be expected everywhere I suppose and is no fault of the employees of Play Factory  I will definitely be back but probably when LO is a little older ,positive,6279574

Surprisingly cool vibe for being in  well  Surprise  ;)Wish I could report on something other than the atmosphere except that I didnt actually order anything besides a very basic drink   The price was reasonable   The appetizers looked interesting from the menu  but I didnt eat  so    The outdoor seating area was great!  My friend and I made ourselves comfortable on a couch near the fire pit   It was a Saturday night and the place was pretty busy for being in  well  Surprise   I have to admit  I wasnt expecting much   Irish Wolfhound turned out to be a very pleasant   surprise   Cant wait to go back!,positive,4659700

Dont worry about what all of it is  just know its all good!  I too had to warm up to Indian food a few years back  but once you develop a taste for it then places like Aroma stand out to you!A beautiful interior greets you as you walk in  as well as prompt courteous service!  Lunch is the time to go to sample many different dishes on their buffet   Ill admit that even after several years of loving this cuisine  I still dont know what everything is and dont care!  Its full of spices and flavors that just wow you  but not set your mouth on fire!  Theres no need to try to describe the different chicken and goat dishes  as Im not sure if I really know!  You dont 4 1/2 stars after 100 reviews if its not good though!!,positive,928971
Very good  clean  tasty choices   The soup and sandwich combo is a great choice for a light lunch   Both the Passion fruit and Green Tea Iced tea I had were delicious The Potato Cream Cheese soup was really good   The BLT with smooth and creamy avocado was also 5 stars Great bread  great sandwich   The Gilbert location is spotless with friendly service,positive,5834101
Wow  nearly a year ago I had dinner with my husband at Pan Asia   The brothers worked the Sushi bar then   We were introduced to their flare of Sushi and loved it  They greeted who ever walked in and sold their special that day  Today  the brothers are gone and so is their Sushi flare    The customer service isnt much to appreciate either   Well the 50% discount on the Chinese food is something to look forward to ,negative,6477719

Great job on our Passat! Offer great options  great warranties   and they were able to fit us in on short notice  We shopped around town and I still think this place had one of the best overall offers when you think of the quality and warranty! Great customer service over the phone And husband says they were great when he took the car in too ,positive,1503517
I wanted to update my review because Ive also had the chance to experience the outdoor stage  I was lucky enough to get VIP lil Wayne tickets last Saturday through my job  For outdoor box seating  you are behind a crowd  but the VIP area is higher  so you can see over everyone  Tables and chairs are also offered in VIP as well as waiter service  The concert was awesome (Ive seen lil wayne like 3 times   He always puts on a cool ass show For real) Only complaint is the outdoor restrooms  Stalls are extremely tiny  The indoor restrooms are open  but pretty far from VIP seating  Overall a great experience and FREE VIP tickets to lil wayne      Yaasss b* ;),positive,2701043
I love quick trip  Clean bathrooms and free air for your tires if you have a flat  But on 3 different occasions I have been to this particular QT and all the gas pumps were shut down  1st time I was told there was a gas spill  I thought ok  no big deal  But the other 2 times after that I was not sure Id be able to make it to another gas station because I was on empty and this happened to be the nearest QT at the time  QT must not care how much business they lose when the pumps are shut down for prolonged amounts of time  This location is right off the freeway so the next closest gas station is a mile or more away ,negative,2406485
This place is so overrated  They hurry you through because its a numbers game  I have decided that after taking my daughter there and the manager did her gel nails she was not happy at all  She said never again  There is so many other options out there  We will go elsewhere ,negative,5510768

I came for the great Diablo Wings of old and got wings drenched in Texas Pete (new recipe) instead   The manager came out and brought me a new order which was supposed to then have the Diablo sauce on them  Yet  he comes back with extra Texas Pete drenched on my wings  The server then asked if I was happy with the wings but of course I was not  My daughter loves Mexican food while Im not a huge fan  But once again  I loved their Diablo wings  Welp  if you want wings drenched in Texas Pete hot sauce then this place is for you  P SMy family really loves this place  My family gives it 3 stars  Food is not terrible but not something that theyre dying to get back to ,negative,1922137

I have been going to this car wash for years  They offer a brush and brushless automatic car wash along with a self service areas as well  I have never had any issues  All the supplies from the pressure washer  brush  vacuums  etc are always functioning and in great condition  The facility is always clean and up kept  However  they have exceeded my expectation because I had accidentally dropped/lost a personal item in one of the car wash bays and I didnt realize it until later in the day  I had returned and inspected the bay  trash  and gas station but my item was not turned in  Days later one of the associates had come to me personally to return my items with everything still intact accounted for since it was found by one of the other employees With their honesty  I will continue to conduct business there and wash my vehicles there ,positive,2207492

Worst location ever!! I love Sonic and I love their food but this location was terrible  I ordered a flavored iced tea which is already pricey  It was 75 percent ice  My husband got a soda that had also contained that much ice  We asked for refills and the manager informed us that we would have to pay for them  We told him that it was mostly ice to begin with and he still insisted he had to charge us  That is crap  If I did not even get the drink I originally paid for why should I pay even more to get it??!!! I have not been charged at other locations and I have never been given a drink with so much ice either  I was so disappointed that I almost did not want to go to any Sonic location again  Get rid of that manager and replace him with someone who is familiar with the phrase customer service  especially when he failed to provide a quality product in the first place  SONIC IS GREAT  JUST NOT THIS LOCATION  DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY HERE!!!!,negative,6442023
First time here and it was amazing they took such good care of us! Best pedicure Ive had in a long time! They actually give you a real foot rub ,positive,1160495
Wow! This museum is truly amazing and fun for all ages  The greenhouse where the butterflies are kept is a true wonderland  even though it is especially hot and humid  Bring an extra shirt to change into  ;) the variety of fluttering butterflies is amazing  They alight on you if you stand still long enough  It is fun to observe others who have no idea they have butterflies on their back  We brought our toddlers and they loved the pond  waterfall and larger butterflies   as they toddler around A definite fun experience for 1 52 hours  The aquarium and reptile areas were fun as well! They feed the fish at about 11 AM  which makes it fun to watch Enjoy!,positive,6470422

To say the least I would certainly watch sports at the Casino Bars or Sports Book rather than this over priced parade of mediocrity!! The food is average at best the Restaurant had dirty uncleaned tables and the talent well    why would they(the women) work at Hooters when you could be a cocktail waitress at the hotel  The drinks are over priced and the management unaccommodating! They tout the location as the largest Hooters however it completely lacks the feel of what Hooters really was meant to be! Try the actual Hooters Hotel or other Vegas/Henderson locations if you want the true Hooters Experience  This place receives one star after trying to receive satisfaction from the management resulting in food which was un edible and patrons whom were clearly over served and creating a disturbance ,negative,5678169
Professional and Knowledgeable I had my first experience with The Glass Guru of Peoria and it was absolutely fantastic  Recently  my back patio glass sliding Acadia door was getting more difficult to open  I made numerous phone calls  too many contractors   just to find out the estimated cost to repair my door would be from 200 to $350  I thought that cost was somewhat on the high side  especially after spending so much money on Christmas but what choice did I have?  The sliders need to be replaced and I could not do it myself  I decided to go to Yelp  for help and thats when I found The Glass Guru of Peoria and Im so glad I did  The installation went great  The cost was less than any quote  the installers were on time   and the job is done quickly and professionally I will definitely use the Glass Guru of Peoria for all future needs ,positive,4259721
Its been 25 years since I could honestly say Ive been totally pain free  With that said I made an appointment with Ashlee to see if there was anything she could do to help me  In just a few short weeks I can honestly say that Im pain free  Do yourself a favor and schedule a consultation with Ashlee  I promise  you wont be sorry,positive,3257366

I am so happy I found the perfect place to go to for any medical issues that might come up  I am new to NC area and by previousreviews decided to go to this practice to get established in NC  Iam really glad I did  The Dr  Staci Le was very kind and professional  Her staff was a delight! Very kind and professional as well  All my questions were answered and medical needs were addressed  I even experienced later getting a touch of the flu which they immediately worked me into schedule  I met Dr  McConnell who was very sweet and took care of me  I wasfeeling better in no time  Very clean and well organized practice Thank you,positive,1877536
Great eating experience here  From the service to the food  Apparently  this is a famous chain out of Miami  We went here for my sister inlaws 40th birthday dinner  Ill just comment on what I ate 1)Appetizer: Crabcake $16 00  not very large  split it two ways and it was delicious 2) Entree: Lobster stuffed in Sole (fish) with assorted sauces  This was very very tasty and while im not a huge seafood fan this was one of my more memorable fish eating experiences 3) Desert: Compliments of the house a brownie slice topped with ice cream and whipped creme for her birthday   well use your imagination on how it tasted Highly recommended and apparently the stone crabs are top notch ,positive,1454955

I visit this location every morning before I go to work  The drive Thur is usually nuts  but I dont mind going inside because the line moves quickly  if there even is a line inside  The staff is always nice and friendly too which is a must! I have to say that I am not really a fan of the new remodel though  If you are looking to sit  down at a table with a friend the new layout doesnt really allow for that  Although it does look very similar to the original Starbucks on Pike Street in Seattle  maybe thats what they were going for  a retro coffee house vibe  Either way I love this location and I am thankful they are there for my morning coffee before work and my treats on the weekends! Yay for Sbux!,positive,2679593

Nice place  reminds me of some fancy resort somewhere   I wont drive out there to visit the hotel or casino as there is no real decent food option  and i am not talking high end celebrity chef  but just decent food or buffet   The casino is horrible and the several times i have been there i dont think there are any employees or customers   Almost every time i was there  i was literally the only person visible  i could have walked out with a slot machine and no one would have known   The hotel seems to only be busy if there is a convention   My wife has done the spa twice but there are so many spas in and around Vegas  this one is way pricey and she will not return   You cannot be pricey in Las Vegas and expect to survive  especially if your 100 miles from anything   In summary  its nice  but not Scottsdale nice  nothing overly motivating to make us visit the hotel or spa and for sure not the casino ,neutral,3889401
Ive always gone for the oxtail which never disappoints  This time I wanted to try something different like their burgers  Service was mehhh(Rosamaria) hate to put her on blast  For some reason we could not get a refill or any help what so ever  When my burger came all she did was drop my burger off and dipped  Couldnt even get a word in  I order cheese with my burger  and guess what? There was no cheese  Had to flag down another waitress since ours was out and about no where to be found  Long story short  there was mold on my cheese  Yuck  I had read another review where there was mold on someones burger bun  That is all ,neutral,2965566
Ok  it is bad enough when they cant get your order correct  we ordered a two item and they gave us three  We ordered the String bean chicken and we got orange chicken  They were out of chow mien  and when they finally made some they served everyone ahead of us and made my wife and I stand and wait for 35 minutes!  I didnt complain  but when you are mistreated and ignored and everyone ahead of you helped then it is just plain bad service! Itzel the employee was the lady that likes to ignore people ,negative,4014490
My wife and I dined here before the Cavs game Friday night and this was our 2nd time to the restaurant  Yet again  we left very unsatisfied and a lot lighter in our wallet   One of the most  if not the most overrated restaurants in the Cleveland area  living off its name recognition   Our server was very slow and rude  she appeared like she didnt care that she was working  several times blowing past our table when I was trying to get her attention   The food was extremely disappointing  everything was way over salted  and it is not very fun when you have to pick out lemon seeds and garlic peel from your food while you are eating   We would never go back here again  and I would advise others to do the same   There are plenty of over excellent restaurants in the Cleveland area to go and actually enjoy your dining experience   Chef Sawyer should be embarrassed at what this restaurant has become ,negative,3825061
Was in Cleveland for three nights  ate here twice   Very pleased with service and qiality of of our meals  John teh Bratender was stellar  helped us with some tips on site seeing  (thanks again john)   If your travels take you downdoen Clevland   Check it out,positive,5917804
Good food  and the waitresses and hostess were great  We bought a bottle of champagne an were told we could cork the rest and take it with us  I guess the waitress was wrong and were not able  so we asked to just be charged for the glasses  but manger was such a jerk  Had a huge attitude and was rude  Super disappointed! I have always loved this place ,negative,1351579
Dammit! I really wanted to like this restaurant since its rated highly  The waitress Victoria was so nice  Some of the dishes we ordered were cooked way too salty: The Traditional and the Corned Beef Hash were unbearable I hope the cook on Tues Mar 29  2016 at 6:15am fixes the salt problem  Please do not over saturate your foods with salt! As for the waitress Victoria  She was cool ,negative,811624
Grouchy Johns is your onestop shop for all things coffee  plus iced  blended  and specialty drinks  smoothies  pastries  wraps and some breakfast items  I just so happened to be in search of a smoothie and this place popped up  How convenient that this eclectic shop was Star Wars themed  They also have plenty of comfortable seating near the front and a quiet back area with a bookshelf filled with comics  I ordered the *Yoda* 20oz  smoothie because how could I not? I opted to add honey versus the agave  This was $6 75 and had kale  spinach  pineapple  strawberry and mango  The presence of kale may have sounded questionable  but the smoothie was delicious! The addition of honey may have helped mute the bitterness from the kale  What a neat spot to discover  As a note  I didnt realize it at the time  but they seem to have a Butter Beer Latte on the specialty menu    wish I had noticed that!,positive,1613895
WORST Doctors Office!  Take your money and insurance somewhere else where you will get properly treated and proper care  This office has very rude women at the counter and the lobby is always hot with a Fan from home trying to cool it down but they are to cheap to run the ac or heater  The doctor is always rushing and very vague with answers to your questions  its a money pit they want your money but will not help  Very bad customer service and Wont return phone calls when your results are in  I have reported this office to the State Medical board and the Business Bureau  Absolutely horrible !!! NO COMPASSION for their CLIENTS ,negative,5884230
Had the Omakase at the instruction of my waiter  since it was my first visit and I have to say that it was a brilliant choice!  I had just had the omakase at Nobu in Honolulu about two weeks prior to my visit to Roka and I still cannot believe that without a doubt I had a better meal with better sashimi at Roka in Scottsdale   The Toro served with Himalayan rock salt was one of the best things that have ever tasted!  Highly recommend ordering the Omakase!,positive,1664087
I just ordered this place off of Uber Eats and it was pretty terrible   I ordered the rare beef and meatball pho and they actually forgot my meatballs   I was stuck with like 3 thin strips of rare beef   Then I try the actual pho and the broth was flavorless and really greasy   My wife didnt eat more than 3 bites of hers because she said the oil was coating her mouth and felt weird ,negative,2329284
I have been taking my dry cleaning here for over a year   More then once I was quoted one thing and when I came to pick up the price was different   My main reason on giving one star is I recently got poison ivy from yard work  and not bad but read that anything you have worn should be cleaned   My work clothes were dry clean only and I was told to tell the dry cleaners so they can handle the cothing with gloves   I told them and the women was so rude and inappropriate and acted like I had just brought a weapon into the store   She said she could not dry clean my clothes and risk infecting her workers and customers  I went right away to another place  they thanked me for letting them know   I asked if they had a problem and he said no  they would just handle with gloves and that the dry cleaning would kill it   DONT WAIST YOUR TIME ON THIS IGNORANT SHOP  THEY LOST MY BUSINESS   I am still in shock at the womans behavior   Absolutely inappropriate and rude as well as degrading ,negative,2222838

5 Arabic television channels welcome many new immigrants on their first stop to America   Management is not concerned if you smoke in your room  the hallway or the elevator   This property would be a five except they serve pork on the breakfast buffet  but it is clearly labeled  Two great lobbies  one street level & one on the main floor   for all your male friends to congregate in 24/7 to stare at the scantily clad western women  A 3 level parking garage where unescorted females drive their own cars   Overall this is a great place to plan a mission or begin settlement in a new country ,positive,58447
The tech that came to my home in May for A/C checkup thoroughly explained what he found after inspecting my compressor   The only test I found lacking was a check to see how quickly the inside air vents cooled when the system switched on  and whether it met the expected temperature drop   When he found a failing fan motor  he confirmed part availability before discussing issues with me to insure he could answer all of my questions ,positive,5032551

They dont care about their patients in pain! Dont believe it when they say just walk in for an injection if you feel bad so we did   the staff is horrible!

Supposedly it was documented   not the case! We walked out and still in pain! They are absolutely lazy!,negative,5116848
I had a fantastic experience bringing my Honda in  specifically with David Widish  I bought it at Zimbrick over three years ago  and brought it in because I heard a buzzing in the speaker  I wasnt able to reproduce it but David still kindly offered to replace the part UNDER WARRANTY (which had just expired technically)  He also noticed that my low tire pressure light was on and checked my tires without my needing to ask  They also will automatically wash your car if you bring it in to get checked or for service   Everyone I ran into was really kind and friendly  I highly recommend!,positive,2108559
I was pleasantly surprised that these are authentic Detroit style coney dogs!  They have many different styles dogs as well   Staff was very nice too   They do have this place set up like a fast food restaurant which is a bit different then I was expecting   They also serve fresh cut fries which is a little different from a traditional Detroit restaurant  but they tasted great and they give you a ton of them   Very happy to have a place in Cleveland to fill my coney craving   I will be back!,positive,2749506
First off  the one star for Stychin Time is because they do in fact do quality  thorough work  Its expensive and Ill never call them a bargain but they do good work and Ive had a few pieces altered here The price point however is not the reason Ill never set foot in there again and Ill never recommend them  All points are lost entirely on human sensitivity  For anyone not aware  in August 2018 there was a shooting in Fredericton  NB and four people were killed  It was a horrifying and tragic event and it made national news  While recently in Stychin Time I overheard the owner discussing the event and making callous  offensive assumptions on New Brunswickers  I wont go into details but needless to say they were hurtful awful things to say about people who are still grieving only one day after this had happened  I am a New Brunswicker and there is more than one good tailor in Toronto ,negative,1142869
Always great service with smile  and great food   This is much better service than Foxs Training Restaurant called the Henry   Very satisfied every time we dine here   The Hostess  and front desk area people were so nice  and with smiles  smiles  and more smiles    the way it supposed to be at Fox concept eateries   We were very dissatisfied with the Henry  and will probably not go there again   Olive and Ivy is a model of great service  and food ,positive,254877

I dont really like to eat at buffets  Not really a big fan of cafeteria style food  That being said  I dont mind having lunch at Feast buffet once in a while  It is clean and they have pretty good salad bar  I usually just eat the roasted chicken and salad if I go here  so I cant speak on the rest of the selections ,neutral,2027300
I had an appointment on a Wednesday evening at 645pm for them to check my tire for a slow leak  After waiting until 715 for my car to be lifted  I was told at 730 that I needed a new tire  They suggested replacing another tire because it too was in pretty bad shape and with it being winter  I went with it  The manager told be that it would be another 45 min to change the tires  So around 815 right? Well I ended up not receiving the keys in my hand until 905pm! From start to finish  it took 2 hours and 20 minutes to replace 2 tires with an appointment!Will never enter this store again  Unbelievable ,negative,2125147
I hate Verizon stores  I almost cancelled my service thanks to the awful experience at this store  All the rep would really sell me was a Droid  I clearly did NOT want one  I have had iphones for the past 3 years and I have no intent on switching  I got to the apple store or order online when I need a new phone  The only reason I stick with Verizon is there coverage is awesome                         thats it  When youre a frequent traveler you dont get many choices :(,negative,2172602
I came here at first with a massage Groupon  The massage was excellent  Once I was given a tour of the physical therapy and chiropractic areas and the GREAT prices  I signed up  Previously I was told by other doctors I may have to live with my back pain  but I knew better  After a free consult and xray with Back Fit  they said Itheycould definitely help me with physical therapy on site  Ive been going there for about 2 months now and I now can sleep without a back brace and feel so much better  I feel stretched and relaxed  Its worth trying!

I booked this show as birthday gift for my husband who has always loved their YouTube clips with their unusual instruments etc  We were underwhelmed   As other reviews state  this show is geared for families with preteens   They played very little music in the 1 5 hours   The rest of the time was spent on skits that involved regurgitating Twinkies   eating Captain Crunch and playing on stage size iPhones   We were expecting much more in the way of actual music and I way overpaid for close seats  The venue is small  DIsappointing experience  sad to say ,negative,1901706
I am a big fan of yummy  crispy wings and this place definitely satisfies that craving  The restaurant is clean and bright  The staff is friendly and welcoming  They have many flavorful options  and their scorching buffalo wings are some of the tastiest HOT wings Ive ever had  All in all  I highly recommend this new place  Its so good I thought wingstop  who?,positive,1843052
Tried giving this place another try this morning   Waited 10 min after they were supposed to be open  then they dropped a bolt from the engine cover and couldnt find it  they also broke the valve stem on our tire and never said anything   As soon as we left our tpms sensor was on  we turned around and they told us we had to wait for them to look at it   There is no way he did not know he broke the valve stem as air was rushing out of the tire   Never going back!,negative,5719626

Ive never gone to a school before for a cut because I have very thick hair and have had my professional haircuts end up looking like a mushroom head  But  I just moved around the corner and thought Id give it a shot Three hours later I walked out with a cut that requires me to visit another salon to get fixed tomorrow  Three people assisted my stylist during this visit and somehow I still walked out with split ends and a less than fresh looking cut I understand that this is a school and that it might take longer and may not come out perfect however  in three hours to not have a decent or at least acceptable cut is disheartening  I honestly hope this isnt the case for all that visit here  but I wont be back ,negative,3062017
This is THE BEST sushi place on the southwest side of Vegas  They just opened about a month ago and I am hooked  I used to frequent Sumo Sushi II but they dont offer AYCE  The owner/manager of 808 is very friendly and gave us the happy hour special even though we were 30 minutes early for the 9pm happy hour  The prices are very reasonable  the hot house sake is very cheap and tasty  and the fish is very fresh  Give it a try  you wont regret it ,positive,5199264

Oh my  the line is long & not moving  At this location  theres only 1 cashier  who has to get all the cooked meals from the kitchen to the counter  Shes so busy that no one can order & pay  Can you hire more people at the counter ? Plus people at the airport are usually in a hurry on their way to the gate  Panda Express is so much better !!,negative,3998606
Jane is awful and rude   When I spoke with her regarding an additional $10 non agreement charge on my account she refused to help me  When I asked her if there was anyone else at Cox I could speak with about this she said she was the highest person there that could help me  Didnt know her last name was Cox  I guess the big bad regional manager didnt want her boss to see what shes really like  I still have a $10 charge on my account that shouldnt be there  Great job Jane! Way to do the right thing by the customer ,negative,3298052
What we love about this place is the consistency of the food  Always good and the service is great too!  Try out their happy hours!,positive,6338978
We were really excited to try this place  Sat for a few before we got greeted  no big deal  Ordered a soda and a Bloody Mary  Main reason for going was for the bloody  Watched it sit at the bar for a good while  Noticed the husband getting antsy about and about to throw down money for the soda and walk out  I walked up to the bar  asked the server if that was our drink and he said yes  I grabbed said beverage and walked to the table  We were promptly asked to leave for grabbing my drink that was sitting while he addressed other tables  We are now at Cold beer and Cheeseburgers,negative,6169147
The two bedroom apartment layout that I rented is great BUT most of the composite of the people renting are very inconsiderate  Many dog owners refuse to pick up their dogs waste and there are piles of it everywhere on the lawn and one afternoon I found some excrement near the entry to my stairs  Dogs bark at all hours and owners refuse to quiet them  The gym needs to be updated  There is a junky truck (it should be parked against the wall) parked in front of my apartment building leaking oil  I caught a neighbor throwing out grease in front of the entrance to my stairs which smelled for days  At the moment there is horrible construction on Warm Springs at the moment and its quite inconvenient to turn into the complex  There are better complexes just east in Henderson where I use to rent  Location is decent for work  close to the 215 ,negative,5035814
Went there today for the first time  The atmosphere was great and the staff was SO knowledgable about dogs  their health  and how to best care for them! I used the selfwash for my dog (which is a large breed) and he did very well  I will definitely be back AND I am going to start using a health supplement they recommended for my dog  Great experience!,positive,6269751
This place got the best customer service ever  A server mistakenly charged my order for 3x prices of cheese fries  but I only ordered one  A very kind guy that served me meals said I can have all of em and still refund my money  Awesome place  Definetely will return again soon ,positive,5396864
Smoothies and avocado toast is what I normally have here  Delicious menu! All seems to be raw foods and is quite healthy  Way to go!,positive,4470290
I have become a regular here as the food and service are excellent and the price is very reasonable  I recommend the pork skewer and fresh spring rolls  those are a requirement every time I go  They have the bento box option that will let you sample multiple items and are a good value and include ice cream dessert and a drink  If you order pot stickers on a sitdown order  they give you a double order at no extra cost  I do not like seafood and I ate the spring rolls like 5 times before I realized they have shrimp in them   They are always on point keeping my water filled  and I drink a lot of water  I just cant say enough good things about this place ,positive,2185567
Just the best staff from our nurses one of them was Jefra and the other was Heather  very attentive and professional  the food is what you might expect in a hospital  than again this was not our vacation  Overall extremely happy with everything ,positive,3353491

$50 down the drain!!! first there is an extremely long line  luckily we had a reservation for a table of 20 and got an entire room to ourselves and were able to bypass that long line to the cashier  the lamb  mashed potatoes were yummy  the shrimp cocktail was delicious  aside from that i didnt have anything good  even the desserts were bland and not as scrumptious as I hoped it would be  needless to say i was extremely disappointed,negative,11754

Its a pretty good cheese steak  but they are hit or miss   I have been here at least 10 times in the past five years  and it is a little bit different every time   Sometimes really good  other times not so great   But the bun is always spot on for authentic Philly Cheese Steak style ,neutral,3251132
Food was great! Atmosphere was splendid! Cant go wrong with their Panang or their Siri Fried Rice ,positive,1231891
Where I can stop by sometime before hit to work for coffee and desert in the morning  I was here a few times and I kinda liked that they have a very nice customer services plus waiters and waitresses were always have a very nice greeting and smiles to all the customers at first stepping the door! If you like cup a coffee and tea plus something deserts go alone with it  and this is a place for you and your family! I highly recommended!!!,positive,6370954
During a recent trip to Vegas  we borrowed our friends truck so that we could move some stuff from our rental home to a storage unit   Of course  the truck started having engine problems as soon as we started driving it   It started to smoke really bad We pulled into this Pep Boys and I bought some oil treatment for the engine     I wasnt sure if it was going to work  but it was worth a shot   I poured it into the engine and lo and behold  it worked!We took off and went on our way Return Factor  60%,neutral,961456
This place takes way to long  15 minutes for a Chicago dog     Come on! 1hour for a thin crust pizza    Get real! I dont have time to waste on businesses that dont value my time  Besides the place is dirty and only has a swamp cooler  Waiting 15 minutes for a hot dog in 90 degrees is miserable  The crust isnt as good as the other Rosatis locations in town  I am done trying this place  I wont go back ,negative,5541172

I have been having trouble looking for a doctor that takes new patients for the past year  Called this office and they were able to schedule an appointment the same week  They were very flexible and the doctor I seen was very understanding and listened and answered all the questions I needed answers for  I guess I found my new primary care doctor! :),positive,2209249
Interesting Korean/Japanese fusion concept in the Tempe area  Although their Yelp rating is very high  they do offer complimentary appetizers/desserts to incentivize reviews  The 3 star rating is because of their small portions and high prices  Service was normal  but the main entrees took slightly longer than usual  Here are some of the dishes that we ordered: Edamame: warm & nicely seasoned (comes w/ Yelp check in) Gyoza: thin skin  very hot when it came out  pretty juicy (comes w/ Yelp review) Chicken Skewer: not much fat  slightly seasoned  Galbi: very tasty & good quality but a small portion Fresh Water Eel: too mushy  wouldve liked it to be more crispy; some small & sharp bones were found in a few of the pieces Chicken Curry Hot Pot: was mildly spicy  a little bit too salty  most of the chicken was at the bottom; large portion of Curry soup,neutral,3194970
Not your everyday bar food  Chicken Florentine was good but the turkey sandwich was really good  Loved the sweet potato fries with their homemade honey mustard  Kale & brussels sprouts are fabulous! Ryan  waistress  she is awesome!,positive,3955899

All of the chicken dishes Ive tried were really good  I liked the Ono Chicken  Garlic Chicken  Furikake Chicken  Sesame Chicken  and the Katsu  Ive also tried the roast pork which had a smoky flavor  and kahlua pork which was tasty The spam musubi was a little disappointing  there was more rice and less spam than Im used to  They have some special menu items  but they ran out of it so we couldnt order it Its a very casual restaurant ,positive,228654
Contacted by the owner about my review  She offered to refund my money for our dinner and invited us to try them again  Since I dont live in that area she kindly sent us our money back  She was very nice about our experience and apologized that it was not what we expected  So I really hope it was just an off night for them when we were there ,negative,767676
This Dutch bros has the most ridiculous drive thru ever  You have to go all the way around circle K  My first time coming here and the lady made me feel like an idiot having me go around out of line when I was already in the line which caused 3 people get get in front of me    not ok! I was already in line  They also have a security guard for a coffee shop??!!! How ghetto! And she was rude  However I saw two other cars jump in line ahead of me and they didnt make them go around     wont be coming back here! Nor did her attitude help ,negative,5152540
Thought Id add my two cents in after having had this place twice now  I feel like Chinese food can be so hit and miss around here but this place is fantastic! The egg rolls are the best Ive had in a long while  they dont forget to include extra sweet and sour sauce when you ask  and the beef and broccoli was so tender! Not chewy and tough like I always seem to experience at other places! The egg drop soup is delicious but Im always so full by the time I get my soup that I never eat much! 5 stars overall  havent let me down yet!,positive,5663901
If youre looking for an upscale Desi restaurant  this is a pretty nice fit  Its very classy  and its prices scream fancy shmancy  Definitely not a casual  grab and go kind of place  The food is O K  Definitely not worth the price! The only thing I would recommend is their club sandwiches (as have been recommended by other Yelpers!) The sandwiches are still pricey  at around $10  but theyre worth it  Also  the tiny toothpick swords they come with are adorable!,negative,3158791
Though this Wendys has a dreary exterior  I was surprised by the updated interior  The carpet was newer and surprisingly clean (not including a table with several fries littered on the floor around it)  My food was your typical Wendys fare  which was exactly what I needed/wanted at the time  I was disappointed that the location did not have one of the new CocaCola Freestyle machines  especially since it appeared to have been recently updated ,neutral,5663390
We came here to try something different for our dessert tonight!!! WOW!!! We purchased the half dozen we got to pick ourselves  So far we ate the Chocolate Peanut Butter Cup and the Bavarian Cream!!! Excellent! Cant wait to have our Blueberry streusel  Peanut Butter and Jelly  Red Velvet Cheesecake and Streusel donuts for breakfast and lunch tomorrow!! Love the style and decorations inside too!!I was beyond pleased to see that they were donating $ to the MS foundation on their water sales too!!

I found Prestige Nail Boutique through Groupon and got the Prestige Signature Spa ManiPedi and upgraded my nail lacquer to hard gel  Anastasia did my nails and she was awesome  She was very friendly and did not make me feel rushed at all  The place is very clean and elegant  Since Im pregnant  I appreciate that they use 5 Free Gel Polish  sterilized equipments and have good ventilation system  At one point the owner even offered champagne for the clients and I was also able to pick a non alcoholic drink  All in all my experience was really good and I recommend this salon especially Anastasia ,positive,2063058
Look sometimes when youre on Mill Avenue at 2:30am and youve had a couple of drinks  you just want some pizza  Sometimes  you just want to grab something quick and easy for lunch  Are you cheap? Good news  Slices is too!Ill keep this one short  Slices hits the spot when Im expecting cheap  quick pizza  Tastes even better when youve had a few beverages Bums me out when they overcrisp my crust though  Contrary to popular belief  its not that enjoyable to bite into a slice of charred Pesto Tomato Pizza ,neutral,3457378
Amazing pizza and even better customer service! This will become a regular on our rotation for sure  Kids loved it  parents loved it; a winner all around  The garlic knots were seasoned perfectly and the dough was perfectly soft  Cant wait to come back!!,positive,283551
This shop is horrible! Dan is a good talker and tells you all the things you want to hear  He never actually works on the car he has inexperienced people doing the work    I had them replace my clutch  but after never engaged properly  I took it back to him and he said that its probably how I was driving it  It worked better before he replaced my clutch  Wow!  So he agreed to take it and look at it but then came up with other problems after replacing more than the clutch because he convinced me there were additional problems! Not an honest man or shop   I pulled my own engine replaced my clutch personally and he didnt even put a new clutch in my car  I had a cracked fork lever  warped fly wheel  throw out bearing barley spun and it was filthy! I could list other things that were completely over looked and not even mention to me that customer   I could go on and on take your cars some where else ,negative,5596202

4 stars! Not 5 because a lil pricey and wish they would stay open later than 6  Found this hidden gem constantly passing through Warm Springs & Durango  The sign says Crepes & Pastries  didnt know it was a quaint Japanese spot  Decided to try some cream puffs and strawberry shortcake to give to the boyfriends parents  Being that theyre Asian  I knew they wont be into the sweet stuff  Maaan I wish I bought more because all the desserts were soo DERISHUS!! (Delicious with a full mouth)  The cream puffs were flavorful  not sweet and light  I was expecting lilihastyle creamy and pudding like  but not these! Light and airy and made you wanna eat more! The shortcake was fresh and like the cream puffs not too sweet just like Old school Asians like it! Love this place! So glad I found it!,positive,55199

I was so disappointed  Im still disappointed  This place was supposed to be the best Italian food ever and quite frankly it wasnt  I like the layout of the place  its beautiful and the people that work here are awesome  but my expectations were so high for the food to be so low  I would come back though  I dont know when since there are so many other restaurants to try in LV  but if this was one of the only places open on a certain day then yes count me in  I dont even remember what I ordered  THAT is a bad sign  Their bread was tasty though ,neutral,2762955
Stopped in to get my Mazda watch appraised and although Aaran couldnt give me a price  since it was exclusive to Mazda  I still enjoyed my time there  He is very fair and honest when it comes to giving appraisals and he is also very knowledgeable and funny if you happen to strike up a casual conversation with the guy  If I find more stuff to hopefully sell  I would definitely go to him first ,positive,4618871

I have had vestibular migraines for over two years  I wouldnt wish it on anyone  Ever  During my research I read several articles about people getting the Daith piercing  I have seen every doctor and tried tons of meds and therapies  I decided to try the piercing  I contacted some female friends who also had migraines and talked with them the piercing  I researched piercing places  We were going to try going together but with summer schedules it was too difficult  So I was number 5 to go  So far we were 3 for 3 in stopping the migraines  Number 4 had hers done right before me  The piercer was Jewell  What a friendly  knowledgeable  steady handed chick she is  She has a long history of piercing  I think my friends made the perfect choice  She talked with me during my piercing which went quick  I bought an piercing after care spray from her and she went over after care with me  I would go to her for any piercing  Let me end by saying ALWAYS TIP YOUR PIERCER OR TATTOO ARTIST!!!!!!!!!!,positive,2254290
This place is 100% a staple for us and they make my favorite el pastor tacos in town  The food comes out fast and the woman who works the counter is so sweet!

Worst Company in existence  they lied to the the home warranty company saying they replaced parts that they didnt replace  and after two weeks of them coming over to the house  the A/C not working  again The reason being because they only added freon and did not work to find the leak on the A/C   They told us to call them back in October when it was cooler The Company is run by two brothers and one of them is a liar that is  additionally disrespectful  obnoxious  and untrustworthy Stay away from them Their info; 1749 E  Palmcroft Dr                     Tempe  AZ 85282                     4806992438 ,negative,6429894
My 3 reasons of why I love this place:1) Damn that fried chicken is good  The presentation and sauces is just spot on  The scotch bell pepper hot sauce is ridiculous on the chicken as well as on anything else  You feel like pilfering a little bottle of it cause its so good  My only rub is that sometimes the chicken gets sold out before the night is done! 2) The cocktails and the bartenders  Drinks are fantastic here and the bartenders know their dranks  The creations are lovely and dangerous  Alcoholics  youve been warned!3) The size  Im partial to smaller restaurants  I like the feeling of compactness  how can you see what everyone else is eating  The easygoing conversations that are layered over each other   Ive had lunch and dinner here before  and highly recommend anytime ,positive,3644913

Seriously the best coffee  Ever  Once we found this place  we went out of our way to and even braved the hassle of parking Uptown just to get coffee here in the morning while we were in Charlotte  They even offer almond milk as an option  (Most places only have soy milk as an alternative  not as healthy as people may think ) Anyway  this place has great coffee in general  a yummy carmel latte  a really good masala chai tea latte  and great service!,positive,4403786

Worst ever!!! 1st  no one will call you to confirm your appointment  and too bad if you miss it you will need to pay for not showing up or for being late  2nd  once you reschedule repeat the time and date as much as you can because you might ended up going and they will tell you that your appointment is on a different date  3rd  Dr  Gupta is the worst dentist ever that we encounter  If your planning to take your child here please just go somewhere  Shes very rude and not friendly to kids  She doesnt have patient when the kids cry  And shes not approachable and helpful  And she will yell at your child! Im just surprise why shes still in this kind of business  Never ever again that we will be back  My child got traumatize because of Dr  Gupta! And finally the receptionist in this office acts like their stupid  They dont know what their doing  Do your job people! Or find another office if your not happy their anymore  Dont make your patients life miserable ,negative,6437805

The old bait and switch!  Do not rent from these guys!  You reserve a Mercedes and they offer you an Acadian   We walked out and rented from the competition across the street   The trick is that they advertise low priced luxury cars and then you get their they think they have you trapped   The airport car rental shuttle buss does NOT take you directly here so you need to take another shuttle after you take the main shuttle and then you are isolated from the competition   Their deceptive marketing practices was enough for me to leave and rent from the others   Such a negative way to start a trip!,negative,4937851
Both entertaining and somewhat exciting  this bar is fun if you want to participate in whats going on around you Big Band is a dueling piano that features music by request  Its fun the first time  but can get somewhat dull after your second or third visit  How many times can you hear Journey played on a piano? Despite the repetition in music  its still a blast to hear it played live by local talent There is a cover charge on the weekends (UGH!) and the cost of drinks are high for the small plastic cups you get in return  But for the entertainment  you cant go wrong  Request for someone in your party to get on stage and play the tambourine ,positive,581680
Always fun to come to the Ex at the end of summer!

Really really quite good  Just make sure to have a stress test first  because this food is rich  rich  rich  And if you go for offal  or heads of pig  that advise goes triple  Fortunately  there are good options for the more squeamish  or the more vegetarian minded folks That said  everything was really nicely dialed in  A Hipster place and environment that still has good food  I like the upstairsyou can scope out the full scene  Lots of good organic and local grub  awesome wines  You cant help but have a good time ,positive,4318461

If anyone reads my reviews its clear Im not a regular at restaurants like this  I try to eat healthy when I can  but Im off the healthy eating train more often than Im on it  unfortunately  When I saw the Groupon for this place pop up  I couldnt resist  Hoping to turn my eating habits around  I thought this would be a good jumpstart  I came in today for lunch and ordered the two for $9 99 combo  I got the coconut smoothie and the spicy Thai wrap  I was pleasantly surprised by the smoohie  but the wrap was a little overpriced for what you get  The dipping sauce was nice  but the wrap needed a little more than just some greens and fruit  Definitely not filling  but tasty Overall  it was a good experience  I definitely wont be a regular here  but I appreciate having this as a good alternative from time to time and they have a great location just below Vegas Hot ,neutral,3107598
Its been a while to get pho  so I went to Sigon8 with Jieun I didnt notice noddle portion was cut down  but bean sprout and other herb portin was cut down and they serve lemon instead of lime(I guess they have some reason) Maybe the season matter with vegetable     not sure Broth was OK as usual(I mean everybody knows every place put MSG in the broth anyway) I didnt try spring roll and best vietnamese coffee(my favorite) this time so maybe next time    ,positive,3258932
I purchased a condo in Las Vegas that was needing a lot of mini repairs   As I live out of town and would be unable to meet someone at the condo  I sent through a detailed list of what was needing to be done and also photos   A few days passed and no one called nor emailed   I contacted them to ask if they had received this email and to find out if they could help   The person that answered the phone was extremely rude and asked numerous times  well  are you going to pay me for the work?  I answered of course I would pay for work performed   He then asked me to send the email again   In trying to understand this persons accusatory response  he said well this is Vegas  you know   I guess hes having a bad day After this interaction  I will not be using this service ,negative,2527216
I would give negative stars if I could  The light in the bathroom was broken  there was hair on the ceiling (not sure how that happens   )  and the room service came at 9:30am (really?!)  We had settled in to watch a movie and had to go all the way down to the lobby to approve my credit card  even though they already had one on file  I called the help desk for assistance with an issue and the lady made fun of my last name and treated me terribly! When I spoke with the manager  she did not care at all  We were on our honeymoon and this hotel did their best to make  it very unpleasant  I would suggest you all go somewhere else if you want a pleasant trip ,negative,2864296
Came here for the first time last week  We were welcomed by a staff member who asked if we had ever been here beforesince we hadnt she explained the menu and everything about the cafe  The food  coffee and service was great!,positive,659325
The fries are the best in the city  probably becasue this Harveys is attached to a Swiss Chalet so theyre extra yummy and chickeny   The chicken burger is always freshly made  juicy  and not charred or dry   Unlimited free drink refills!  The service is excellent across the board  and I feel that (except for one baldish male manager)  they are genuinely sincere and happy to serve   Its always busy  and there is never a wait   The tables are as clean as they can be  considering the huge amount of customers   (Always a large number of sexy blue and white collar male customers to ogle too   teehee!),positive,4894415
Avon Marshalls Great stuff but there is a Retail Grinch working there this Christmas  She would not let me use a gift card with money on it because I was opening a charge and putting  my things on a  new Marshalls charge card  She said  :  They dont like that   Also  every time I am in there asking me to  fill two carts up! Wow!!! super bossy dont appreciate the attitude           ,negative,388729

The worst!!! I live right next too it so god forbid I need something easy Ill be waiting in line for 20 mins at any given time of day you stand there with 5 people in front of you trying too lock eyes with any of the employees as a desperate plea too please open another line but instead every one of them sits behind customer service and socialize like some ironic fuck you too everyone in there!!!  Sorry man I know everyone bashes everything on this site but its my little passive aggressive way too make myself feel better for getting so pissed off in a grocery store ,negative,5053365

I love  love  love Yama Sushi! Ive tried other sushi places  some bad  some ok  but this is the only AYCE place that Im always excited to go to   My favorites are the NoName  the Sun of the Beach and the Harry Potter  Theyre so delicious   I could eat them every single day  Another must is the Spicy Seafood Salad  And you must finish your meal off with the Plum ice cream or some sweet Mochi  The only reason I dont give it 5 stars  and as others mentioned  is that its always so crowded so it makes the service kind of slow   But hey  that means its just THAT popular ,positive,2463971
Great place to grab a bite when you dont feel like fast food or going to a sit down restaurant     as far as food court food goes  this place is pretty damned good ,positive,1543275
I have been to Jamaica many times  have worked in a Jamaican restaurant and I believe this may be the best Jamaican in Toronto  The place is comfy and quaint with friendly staff and just the right vibe for those missing Jamaica  I love the stewed  Jerk chicken  The steam veggies are great  Kids love the fried chicken  Red Stripe   though  tastes no different :),positive,2225353
So youre walking through the mall by planet Hollywood and suddenly it hits you  Youre starving  What should we eat? Oh  heres a quick taco joint  thatll probably be ok  If you walk down that path  youll soon discover that Rockin Taco is more than ok  For just under $10 you can get a few tasty tacos  a side  and a beer   You pick your toppings as you move down the assembly line style ordering station  pay  and find a seat  The food is very tasty for the price point and you can decide to eat at rockin taco  order  pay  eat  drink your beer  and be back to walking the strip in under 30 minutes ,positive,4529020
This was my first time at Vdara and I was excited for this 5 star resort experience  Unfortunately  it felt more like a three star hotel room  The pull out bed was horrendous  even with the feather down pad that you have to request  They dont provide cots and they talk to you on the phone like youre bothering them somehow  The regular bed was fine though  The room layout was not what the front desk rep described and was not very intimate or private  The internet was unreliable and it took some time and effort to get the front desk on the line to ask for a late checkout and for your car to be pulled up from valet  both of which they could and would not do for you  I did not feel valued or very welcomed as a guest and it was an overall disappointment  I would not recommend this hotel to friends  Frankly  the best part of the room was the view and bath robe ,negative,5629526
I had a wonderful experience at David Scott Salon and Spa! I read the reviews online and decided to give it a try  I had an express mani and a signature pedi with Angie  She was fabulous! She was very professional and took the time to get to know me  My pedi was heavenly and she really worked on my feet  It was a little more than I like to spend on a mani/pedi ($70 for the two) but it was worth it  I will definitely be going back to Angie ,positive,2122517

Expensive  terrible bean burritos and cheese dip! Didnt expect italian when we ordered two bean burritos that were served filled with a small amount of watery beans  and swimming in what smelled and looked like marinara or speggitti sauce! There was actual italian seasoning on our bean burritos   We were really hungry  so we ordered the cheese dip to go along with basket of chips (which were stale btw)   The cheese dip was the texture and appearance of a high fructose corn syrup laced salad dressing  which tasted absolutely fake!  I really wished we would have drove through taco bell instead of wasting $36 on this italian/mexican food stuff  Ewwww!,negative,1068800
This place is awesome ever since its reopening by the new owner  The food is amazing and the staff is super friendly  They are open 24/7 so I highly recommend checking them out after a night out  Jake the bartender is pretty rad  make sure to have him make your drinks ,positive,5449210
I gave them OK cause it is fresh   but Ive had better for taste   so 1 star less for taste!I asked them what their most popular dishes were   the lobster roll and their signature dish is  the soft shell crab sandwich    it looks very impressive when you get it   Whole crab deep fried with sauce  lettuce but taste wise its nothing special   I think it could use a makeover in flavour   Id rather have soft shell crab maki rolls over this     It is fresh so watch out  the first few bites can burn as the juices burst out   I think if you just like the taste of the crab and then it would be a winner but I found it bland   There was a sauce on it but it disappeared in to the batter so you couldnt taste it      Fries were only soso    oil was getting old   The slaw was tasty   I might go back to try their lobster roll  The people next to me had it   Im not sure if I am convinced since youre paying $20 for a sandwich,neutral,2072430
Came here for their Monday night special    $5 personal Margherita pizzas and $5 Moscow Mules! Such a good deal :)Everyone got a Margherita pizza  except for myself; I got the Misto appetizer (selection of meats  cheeses  olives/pickled veggies and a big plate of focaccia bread)  Everything was delicious  my Misto platter was definitely big enough as an appetizer for a table of 46 people  let alone a whole dinner for one person For drinks me and my boyfriend each had a couple of moscow mules and our friend had the Sangria Roja The normal prices werent bad at all  I think the Misto was only $15 and well worth it  We will be back for sure ,positive,660549
Its nice to have this an option for people  Its mainly a junk food vegan place  Ive eaten here three times  The animal fries (now called west coast Fries  due to In and Out Burger objecting :)) are okay  the cheese is very mediocre  Fake chicken wings are also just okay  no way you can mimic real wings but nice try  Service is very mediocre every time we went in  Try not to ask them for anything once you order The soynamis are a nice treat and I think its their signature thing As far as vegan restaurants the Loving Hut is so much better ,neutral,3270406
My rescue had terrible teeth!  I knew it but waited too long to do something about it ($$$$$$$$)   I took her to Dr  Nelson and she had to have numerous extractions   She is an older dog and I was afraid  frankly Wound up with such a positive outcome!  She feels so so much better and I didnt have to use the pain meds   One tooth was so horrid it was beginning to rot in her jawbone!  I will now go without food myself if any of my rescues need a vet   All of the staff is friendly  compassionate and professional   God Bless ,positive,3804855

I had been going to the Roti Lady since I was a kid living in Parkdale  but years later (in my mid 20s) I moved back into the neighborhood to notice some disappointing changes as to how they do things The prices are phenomenal and you will not be able to see Island Foods or some other Carribean place beat them in this area as rotis range from $3 50$8 00 as many of her prices have changed recently She doesnt use dhal puri roti but a thicker paratha one which may be at times a little chewy  There was a time she did everything fresh daily but now the fillings (chickpea  spinach  potato  beef  and lamb) are all in the fridge ready to be reheated day after day  I also routinely find twigs from the curry leaves stuck inside most of the fillings nowadays but I dont mind as long as its clean  The decline in quality over the years havent phased me that much  and I still love the Roti Lady on Dunn Recommendations:Chickpea RotiCoconut Candy,neutral,2128557

This is a new restaurant concept  Their menu is a bit limited  Their beer menu is also a little light and what they have is well off the beaten path  Staff seemed to be distracted and inattentive to their tables  We noticed lots of people waiting for drinks and trying to flag down their server  They are in a very expensive space  so they are going to need to step their game up soon to attract repeat customers ,neutral,5228003
Went for breakfast on Saturday morning Lots of variety on the menu  I got the garden omelet  grits  and banana bread  My associate got garden inlets with olives no broccoli  rye toast and cottage cheese  We both enjoyed  Generous portion  Omelet was big and very good  Done well  Grits were kinda bland  and the banana bread was moist  Our server was nice  Looks like lots of regulars go there  Had a good bfast  Id be willing to go back for another try or lunch  The only down side is that the interior it is kinda dank  Not dirty but not decorated nice or really appealing  Again  Didnt seem dirty just an old room that was bland and dank ,positive,6217920

I visited this restaurant for the first time on Tuesday and it was quite an experience  While first walking in  it reminded me of Waffle House  however the environment was different and I dont believe it is a chain restaurant  My server for the morning was a woman named Dana  and she was very nice  respectful  helpful and patient (because the person I was with was ordering a large amount of food)  She even helped him figure out how to get everything he wanted at the lowest price possible  He ordered some of the chicken wings they have on the menu  and they were some of the best looking chicken wings I have seen in my life  Plus they werent baby wings  they were full large sized wings  I wanted to try them but sadly  Im allergic to wheat  My food (hashbrowns and bacon) was good  I had already eaten prior to going to the restaurant  therefore I did not order much  My food was great though and so was service ,positive,2685383
I found Umbrella Movers through the UHaul website and Im so glad I chose them from the list!  Al and Nick showed up half an hour early  knocked on the door to make sure that early was ok  and immediately got to work   They were polite  professional  funny  and very respectful of the sensitive nature of my move (resulting from a breakup)   They NEVER dawdled  but kept moving all the time!  They also did an amazing job jengaing my belongings into the rather small UHaul truck I had rented  Just when I was losing hope that it would all fit  they found a place for every box and piece of furniture safely and securely!  Their price was extremely reasonable and when I went a half hour over  they only charged a prorate  not a full hour like some moving companies would   I was thrilled with my easy move and would absolutely hire Umbrella Movers again and recommend them to anyone who wants a smooth moving experience ,positive,2063508
Ashley was the sweetest person Ive met buying makeup  Extremely informative and helpful  I felt awful for coming in 10 minutes before closing time and she was more than understanding and efficient than any sales rep Ive ever encountered  Patient yet completely quick with service  I got what I needed and was out in no time  Her recommendations were genuine  I will return  Youve got an amazing beauty guru  take care of her,positive,363064
Parking is horrendous at this location  and because so  overpowers any positive news in the restaurant  The U haul neighbors dominate the parking area with ominous threatening signs The restaurant was ok  Standard fair  It was a busy night & tables were crammed next to each other  Bumping elbows & chairs does not condone a pleasant experience  Food was ok  Have gotten slightly better at other locations   Server was new  but pleasant and handled tables reasonably well About equal distance from another location   Will go there next time ,negative,4176916
I feel like a squeaky wheel sometimes but here I go  Nothing like spending 40 bucks at Panda Express to find a black hair in my food  Totally disgusting  I dont want a response from Panda Express telling me that they care and want to make it right because its too late; I will never return ,negative,2049771
Efren and his crew are true professionals  They make my two cars look brand new each time they detail them  Their prices are very reasonable for the high quality work they do  and the only thing I do myself in between detail jobs is use a California duster and  occasionally  a shot of exterior detailing spray wiped off with a microfiber cloth  Give To Your Door Detailing a shot; you wont regret it!,positive,975433
My greasy  guilty pleasure I really like the look of this drivethru  Theres 2 lanes  but rarely do I ever see the other one opened  You can sit outside and enjoy your meal if the weather permits My favorite order here is their double bacon cheeseburger  YOU MUST ORDER THEIR SEASONED FRIES  They are amazing! Their fully loaded fries are equally enjoyable as well  Im only rating this place a 3 due to my most recent visit  The ranch was extremely oily ( I couldnt enjoy my meal how I usually do because of this Overall  this isnt a bad place to grab lunch or dinner at ,neutral,3750384

Great culinary experience  From the start we were attended  Even though we showed up early  they did the impossible to accommodate us  And then  they greeted us with a nice glass of Champagne  The food was amazing  Modern and soothing  Fresh and carefully done  Well presented and appetizing  The pace was appropriate and as another token of appreciation  given the fact that we were celebrating a special occasion  a mesmerizing chocolate dessert was added to our order of desserts Its one to be tried!,positive,1446573
Finally got the chance to try me some savoury pie goodness! Unfortunately it took me a while to actually find the place  didnt realize it was tucked behind a corner at first (the address says its technically on the Queensway but its just behind it)  but once I figured it out I was quite impressed with the selection  Im a bit picky as I dont eat lamb or mushrooms (very common ingredients in savoury pies)  but I was able to find multiple pies to choose from that suited my tastes  Yay! I got 4 pies to go  and I love that they have a prethawed option for when you want to bake it yourself later that day  Convenient! The baking instructions were simple and the pies were delicious  I tried a special pie (brisket and cheese) and it was so delicious (love that they put the flaky crust all over  not just on the top)  Great place to pick up a delicious  easy meal for a night in!,positive,1117108
Wow they are not stingy lol they serve huge portions!!!!

Its amazing how much execution makes the difference  Cirquestyledancers is the new fad in Vegas clubs  Light does it right  The club is very vertical which is unique and makes for lots of good spots to people watch or hang/dance in your own little space  It feels intimate and large all at the same time  The music and lighting is always topnotch  The light wall and 30foot high stage sends vibes through the club that just get you going  And the quality of the people in the club is high Ive seen people complaining about prices and drunk girls losing their phones/wallets  Really people? The only people shocked by Vegas club prices are newbies  Its expensive  Deal and just enjoy yourself  And  as I said above  I like the crowd here  Its not shady  Mostly good people with limited exception  If you lost something    sorry  That sucks  But its probably more your fault than the clubs  Just saying   ,positive,3255662

The poor reviews for this Arribas are correct  I wish I would have read them before I wasted my time and money eating there  There was a large spill left under our table  It looked like a spilled drink because of the lemon in the middle of the puddle  The table was short of napkins and silverware  We had to beg for more  The service is horrific !  The food is terrible and overpriced  The rice had so much pepper on it that none of us could eat it  The cheese enchiladas were cold and tasteless  The beer was not cold  Dont waste your time and money  Youd get a better mexican meal at Taco Bell or Del Taco ,negative,4970839

We purchased from a different carmax (prior to moving) before and that one was awesome so when we looked to purchase a car we sought out a nearby carmax  This particular location doesnt seem to do a very good job in the service department when it comes to hitting the 120 checkpoints they advertise before putting a car in the lot for purchase  All of the cars we test drove had issues that were a part of what was supposed to be a part of their checklist  That doesnt give you a lot of confidence to purchase ,neutral,6090302

While trying the eats at various food trucks in the wee am hours on Sunday  we walked up to the lonely yellow trailer  sitting there without a tow vehicle  to see what all the coffee trailer had to offer  For such a small vehicle they had a pretty decent selection of items  Wife decided she was going to give them a chance  and ordered a mango smoothie  after inquiring as to how strong they made them  Satisfied with the employees response  she pulled the trigger I havent seen her grin that quick after tasting something that is supposed to be mango in quite some time  Were not coffee drinkers  but if I see them around  I know how to win points easily!,positive,6386845
Mmmm the Nutty Pie is delicious !The cinnamon sprinkled on the ice cream adds an even greater delicious taste  Such a yummy dessert  You guys do put too much Nutella though  We had to take some off to not regret eating too much sugar  I havent tried your pizzas yet  but I can tell from your dough with the Nutty Pie  the pizzas must be amazing!

We dined at Social on a Friday night  about 8pm The far was pretty good and prepared well  The wait staff a bit to casual for my tastes  but did thier job well and were polite  The flank steak salad is great  I wanted to order 2 more plates of it The wine list was weak  and the whole place felt a bit like a chain rest I wuld suggest sitting in the front room  or at the bar for a more cool eperience ,neutral,5986392
We stopped by the Golden Nugget Buffet after getting off Big Bus Tours and cruising Fremont in the day time (best at night)  The food was good  We actually used the dining room area instead of the Buffet  I purchased a meal that included a salad and desert from the Buffet  I think it was the Steak and Shrimp special  It also came with a baked potato and bread choice  I got the sour dough and it was very good  All of us ended up taking most of our food back the Hotel  It was a lot of food ,positive,6108172
Horrible! Absolutely horrrrrrible! How come a major telecom company cant manage to port a simple phone number?

This place has ruin its reputation faster than Tiger Woods  When I came here a while back  I remember reviews being positive but I had my doubts  After tasting the pho  I knew I had good reasons to be doubtful  The broth and noodles were flavorless  The only saving grace was the rest of the ingredients were acceptable and my Pho did come out hot The only way you can have worse service than an Asian restaurant is not even executing the simplest request  I asked the water 3 times till I finally got my first cup of water  Water or some other drink should be given when  you sit down with your menu  The waiter just couldnt remember a cup of water  and there was only 2 other small groups in the restaurant  Im surprised he actually got the right order There are a bunch of other places on Spring Mountain  try one of those instead ,negative,5411549
Delicious quesadillas and tacos  solid guac  good (and large) drinks! The patio on the front is super cute and perfect for summer  Overall would definitely go again!,positive,860623
While on the hunt for new couches we discovered this new store being built right by our house  After shopping around we agreed they definitely had the best prices and made our purchase on the 4th  We were told part of our sectional was on back order but was scheduled to be delivered on the 7th (plus or minus 10 days)  Well the 17th rolled around and we hadnt heard from them  We called and were informed that the delivery date is now the 20th (plus or minus 10 days)  They didnt even apologize for completely misleading us and leaving us with half a couch  Not only was it half a couch but it had a sharp edge that is meant to be covered by the rest of the sectional so our daughter cut her foot getting off of it  On top of all that they actually seemed offended that we were upset We finally received the rest of our couch on the 24th  While I was happy with the prices and selections their customer service is enough to keep us from going back or recommending them ,negative,6382854
Food was good but going through obvious growing pains as a new place  Service was terrible   Well give it another try in a couple months cuz the place has potential ,negative,1227404

Derek took excellent care of me! He installed a brace to strengthen the interior driver side door handle on my 2006 New Beetle  Also he replaced the batteries on my electronic key set ***Something I had been putting off for the fear of how much it would cost  He does great work ,positive,872237
 First and last time there  Just moved to the area and looking for a good spot to get a hair cut  There was a few good reviews from Yelp but apparently those were all friends because I got the feeling unless you know someone youre going to wait  After an hour and half of waiting and seeing a half dozen people arrive after me and sitting down before me I decided to leave  Theres plenty of other places in this town that gives good hair cuts and good service ,negative,26500
Me and some friends went after work and ate a ceviche and it was the best ceviche i ever ate  Truly had an authentic criollo taste  I definitely recommended   Don Beto knows what hes doing ,positive,3597688
Dont be fooled by the low prices  The food was pretty good and the servings are HUGE! Each serving could easily feed two  My only complaint is that I asked them to make my meal extra spicy and it wasnt spicy at all  I would definitely go back ,positive,912972
Gross all three times  Two of three times we received uncooked chicken and the wait staff had the nerve to tell us that we must be tasting it wrong Service was horrible two of three times and food was a train wreck all three  Chicken fingers once cooked were all breading  Prices are affordable  not sure how theyre always busy  they must get someones food right  Wouldnt recommend for much past pizza or simple things  Check meat before biting in ,negative,1613141
Amazing    I had too much time to kill before my flight and got tired of eating bad food and perusing the magazine racks and wandering into xpress spa   Great menu with lots of travel friendly options (like massages in 15  30  45  and 60 min increments)   I got a 45 min massage and it was perfect   She didnt get lotion in my hair and I didnt feel greasy/yucky on the flight home   Nice ending to my trip ,positive,300452
One of the best restaurants in Pittsburgh  Located in an old micro brewery on the edge of downtown and the Strip District  Eleven serves up one of the best menus in the city  The Chef deserves a Michelin Star for the flavors and presentation of the various dishes  The bar is excellent and the service fine ,positive,4076111
Disappointed Ended up going here for dinner because other top buffets either closed their buffet lines early due to overcrowding or had waits of 2 hours   Waited one hour to get in Not sure why Cravings still appears on many top 10 buffet lists   The servers were slow  there were limited food options  and the warming stations were not very well attended to   Lots of items were mislabeled ,negative,890879
Food  drinks and service was very good  Waiter came to see us many times and at one point even the chef  even after paying  Quite impressive ,positive,1241996
Really good!!!I read about Razzos on Yelp and although I had visited the Mall area  never noticed this rather colorful eatery   My husband and I decided to give it a try  We were not disappointed  We noticed the busyness upon our arrival and thought it would be a long wait to be seated  I got out of the car while he parked  To my surprise we could be seated right away  I studied the fish pond while I waited on my husbands arrival  We were seated promptly and attended to by our wait staff  Received great recommendations for drinks then ordered  My husband chose the ribs and I chose the stuffed shrimp  Deelish all the way   I got their Peach Bread Pudding to go and it was scrumptious  I actually had some the following day  It seems we got n just in a nick of time because as we were leaving we noticed it to be much more crowded  Family type environment  We will be back   ,positive,4308338
We got Saag Paneer and Lobster Tail on Rice with coconut sauce  Food was surprisingly good  although the portions are very small  The waitress was attentive and very friendly  Despite all the positives mentioned above  I most likely will not return  It is overpriced for what you get   even with Groupon it was not worth the value ,neutral,5998770
Normally I find the food here excellent   Tonight  we ordered med rare lamb skewers delivered   Well  the lamb was well done to burnt   When we contacted the location  the response was call tomorrow when a manager is in   I took the over cooked lamb and drove to the location   They provided a replacement order of lamb  but would not do anything about the original delivery fee It appeared that there was no manager oversight at the location and the staff are not empowered to correct these kind of issues If I want over cooked meat prepared by teenagers  I can visit the local burger joint  We call Me va me to enjoy a well prepared lamb skewers  I like to give companies a chance to fix issues  Given the lack of authority at Me va me  I will look to pick up overcooked burgers somewhere else next time ,negative,3912863
Food was so good! Came here the day after Christmas for dinner  My husband and I shared the chicken and waffles plate  The portions are big enough to share unless youre really hungry  We started out with their famous classic biscuits and OMG!  They were the best biscuits Ive had hands down! Moist  crumbly  light and just the right amount of doughiness (dont think thats a word)  The order came with honey butter and apple jam  Its a must order! I woke up thinking about their biscuits the next day they were so good! Their sweet tea was good too   I had 4 glasses! So sad they dont have a location in San Diego :(  Will definitely go there again when in Vegas maybe try out their brunch ,positive,1239175
This is the first time that we have ever left our animals with a boarder in which we felt perfectly comfortable in doing so  In the past  we have had dogs come back with fleas  stress marks on their noses  We could just tell that they had been penned up most of the time  Not here  The daily pictures and report cards just solidified what a top notch place this is  Our animals  2 dogs and 1 cat  came back in good health  Tired     but healthy  We will not hesitate in taking them there again and recommending it to all of our friends  Even our 11 year old Schnauzer did well and made a few friends  Thank you  Pack Pet Resort  for making their vacation an enjoyable one ,positive,5343444
This place is kinda dirty  to be honest  The machines/equipment arent well kept  Everything is coated with dust that settles on to the sweat/bodily fluids that get on the machines  The gym that I used to go to in the Bay Area (California)  was probably older than this gym  but so much cleaner  Besides that  you pretty much have everything you need here to get where you want to be here to get the job done  Theres also a swimming pool    But I wouldnt want to swim in there ,negative,5487098
Came here on a Friday night with my family   Like the atmosphere (modern and happening) not too loud   My family order a WHOLE table of food   I got the Miso Soup and Fish and Chips   Yes  I ordered Fish and Chips   The fish was panko!  Everything was tasty   The service was good ,positive,664116
The ice cream and smoothies are delicious  The only reason I rated them so long its because they have really bad customer service  The person who helped me out had an attitude the whole time  He acted like he was there against his will or something  I would not go back because I didnt feel welcomed at all ,negative,4909461
Great drinks   good food!  Fajitas were good and wife had tacos!  Great scenery in an awesome part of town,positive,1454758
When i first played this course I hated it     The layout isnt too bad and the conditions are usually in pretty good shape   There are some weird holes like the double green par 3 par 4   At first it feels pretty manufactured (residential golf community) but after playing on it has grown on me   The last hole and the 9th play pretty hard   Its a good mid tier all around course,positive,6355019
Our lunch at this location of Symposium was very good! Id recommend the Mediterranean salad with grilled salmon  the salmon was perfectly grilled cooked through but not dry with a good amount of char     My dining partner had the Tuscan tomato bean soup which was quite filling and yummy   My salad was full of fresh crisp romaine lettuce with juicy tomatoes and feta in a light dressing  Portions are reasonable for the price   Liquor prices are surprisingly decent a 6oz glass of wine can be had for $6 00 I would not hesitate to return and try something else other entrees we saw other diners order looked good  Our server was great very attentive given that she had several tables and it was a busy lunch time   This location is relatively new so everything is sparkling new and clean ,positive,4136092
A pretty nice place to get eyebrows done  I had never tried threading before  only saw some Middle Eastern friends doing that on their faces  seemed scary until I tried myself in Threading Experts  Have to say this place charges less than I expected  with a good quality and nice service ,positive,115892
First my name is Mike not my x wife Karey  From the initial phone call to the end these guys are great  I was concerned about guys milking the clock for a up charge but these guys couldt of worked any faster  I am an old factory rat from Michigan so I know production work and shipping  There prices are excellent and took good care of my stuff  Quit looking  call this company! I work in healthcare and come in contact with a lot of people  so anyone in need of movers I will recommend this company  Thanks!,positive,1132162
Tucked away on a side street off a main drag  we found Mosaic  Surprisingly fancy and expensive  with an elegant feel  almost like its your parents kind of dining experience Loved the different options for the tasting menus  Focus on seafood and meats  My husband loved the What the Foie?? appetizer which had excellent presentation  My sea scallop appetizer had a monstrous scallop that could have easily fed a family of four Feeling fishy that night  my better halfs halibut was surprisingly salty with a heavy sauce  My steak was good  but nothing special  in fact I was disappointed Id gotten it  Extensive wine selection  Dutch cheese plate and chocolate hazelnut custard for dessert  Overall  a pleasurable meal with wonferul service and presentation  but for the price  they could really up the quality of the food  We had a dinner elsewhere a few nights later for the same cost that was much tastier from a food perspective ,positive,5738297
I was so impressed with the Chapman BMW service department  I took my 2016 X6 into the service department because I had a low tire warning  I thought I had a flat tire and my BMW warning told me to run flat to the dealership  I conveniently made a same day appointment online  When I arrived at the dealership I found Matt Konecek the advisor I contacted and I was in and out in ten minutes with my loaner and on with my day with no inconvenience  The next morning my vehicle was all ready done and ready to be picked up  The BEST part was nothing was wrong with my tire it was just low on air  and Chapman had the courtesy to do my oil change and vehicle maintenance slightly earlier than it was due because my vehicle was already there  I really appreciate the honesty  courtesy  and professionalism at Chapman BMW  I have had experiences with the dealership and service department and both have exceeded my expectations  I HIGHLY recommend Chapman BMW for your BMW purchase and service ,positive,2766073
So we were in Las Vegas for a few days and wanted to eat off the strip  We looked up to see what was on yelp and Island Style came up so we decided to check it out  We exited the 15 and headed out to the location  When we arrived we asked could this really be the location? The location is in a tiny strip mall  We decided to walk in  What a surprise  the place was really clean and we were greated by a welcoming man by the name of Russell  We ordered the spicy pork and the combo plate  All of the food was awesome I couldnt choose a favorite  The tea was some of the best tea I have had  Russell was nice enough to show me the bag so I could get some later  This is some of the best food my wife and I have had  We will always stop here when in Vegas or close by  We even joked that we may have to move to Las Vegas just to be able to eat here  I am already craving the next trip ,positive,4527011
The smooth texture of the frozen custard is unbeatable   Ive been to a couple other frozen custard places but I still like this one the best   Although its creamy and sweet the ice cream should be its not too rich the way a place like Cold Stone could be   I favor the Concretes which you can add items to your chocolate or vanilla flavors to create what you want   My personal favorite is the blueberry added to the vanilla custard with pieces of waffle cone  heaven ,positive,5012112
I love frozen yogurt and have a simple formula: original tart fro yo with strawberries and some chocolate chips  Somehow  Sweet Frog missed the mark on that  This runny fro yo has a creamy sweetness that makes me think theyve mixed in some unnecessary additives  destroying the crisp tanginess  The strawberries were sad to say the least  and the toppings bar was largely committed to oversized candy chunks  If youre looking to overpay for a cup of mixed candies  this might be the place for you  If youre looking for a refreshing summer treat  keep walking ,negative,2396774
Started off with the ravioli fritti appetizer  This first dish set the expectation for the other main dishes  Just like everyone recommended the ravioli frittis were addicting  If I had these at home I would be downing them like popcorn  Theyre just so yummy (5/5 stars)  For the main dishes got the Butternut squash ravioli (4/5 stars) and Fettuccini Alfredo (3/5 stars)  The first few bites were awesome but as I kept on eating the flavor started to get a bit boring  The place was pretty packed during lunch on a weekday but service was still good  The overall experience was great and I really want to give this place a higher rating but when compared to places like Remezzo I just cant justify any higher than a 3 5 star overall rating ,neutral,4577522
Walked in last minute and they created a beautiful arrangement of a dozen roses  Price was very reasonable  Will be going back there ,positive,5899796

Decent  but pricey furniture   The help is far from professional    Just learned of a clerk sharing CONFIDENTIAL customer information    They should be sued and shut down for what they did!     I will NEVER shop there again  as I cannot trust their staff and methods of staff training     I have no faith that they would treat my confidential information as such ,negative,830545
This is like writing a review for my parents home growing up  Im so emotionally attached I dont know if Ill be able to give a fair and accurate review  Look  tits are a dime a dozen   Actually theyre twenty dollars a song  But crazy horse transcends pricing  They offer love and support to those having intramarital problems  They provide a soft pillow for a horny dude  so long as hes got some money  They provide so many tits  You have to ask yourself one question  Do you like tits?If the answer is yes (it is  because youre reading a fucking review of a strip club) then you should partake  Dont fuck this up for yourself ,positive,5268625
our dog chewed up a hose in our washing machine! grrrrwe went over here with a lot of clothes and just because we were finally getting out to a laundry matt  a whole bunch of blankets  sheets  pillow cases  etc   we came in and it wasnt busy at all   lots of people were coming in and out actually picking up laundry that they left to the laundry matt to have done for them   lots of washing machines different sizes for small to extra large loads same goes for dryers    its kept very clean  and if you have any problems or questions there is a very nice gentleman who will answer every and all questions that you have   its located in a shopping area and theres a park across the street!  So if you got the kiddos with you  and you have a supervising adult handy while you do the laundry  its very convenient   weve since replaced the tube but II will frequent this place to wash my comforters!,positive,6621285
This mall is always busy and while the kioskninjas drive me a little crazy (especially the card trick guys; I loathe magicians) I usually find what I need there  The layout is just a little odd  particularly trying to get to Macys from the escalators near Guess  but with a little patience you can figure it out   If you are trying to get to the Apple store  Dillars  Z Gallerie etc  try entering through Nordstroms; there is a valet there and its a lot quicker ,neutral,5376739

Same issue as others with waiting  Staff doesnt care and says its normal to run this far behind  How far behind can you get before a 940am appointment?One hour past my appointment time and they said there are still 2 people ahead of us  When you specialize in pediatric ophthalmology  you cannot expect small children to wait this long ,negative,4375374
Venue is amazing  With downstairs and upstairs seating  outside and inside  Strong Mexican American themed  Menu was basic but the shrimp ceviche we had was very delicious  The drinks were alright like any other place  Our problem was definitely the bartender    didnt balance his bar correctly  Slowest service  We wouldve stayed longer if he was more attentive  I was sobering up while I waited for my next drink ,positive,5795897
Very underrated   Free parking  Reasonable prices  Unique pickings  Culture in Cleveland :) Nothing like coming down early and watching people set up their shops  I usually start my shopping trip at crepes de luxe and city roast coffee and tea (they are next to each other)  You can pretty much get anything you desire in your crepe and its definitely enough to share   See if you can find your way up the stairs and sit on the rafters to watch the market fill up while you eat    After breakfast stop by czuchraj meats for some legendary beef jerky  Some shops such as the orale contemporary mexican cuisine are not open on mondays  The orale has awesome enchiladas; they will heat them up there for you or wrap them to go   Stop by campbells popcorn shop to sample different kids of popcorns  If you happen to still be hungry after your trip get a gyro at steves gyros and you will probably never have to eat again  I recommend bringing cash (lower bills such as 1s and 5s),positive,5861457

East Blvd  Bar & Grill is a great place for an easy  casual meal  Ive been there a few times  and while the food is never OUTSTANDING  I think its consistent and reliable  Some faves:The windows open all the way  so if you sit at a window and they open them  its like youre sitting outside but without the direct sun  Perfect compromise if half of your group wants outside and the other half in Chicken cheesesteak *on a wrap* is delish  Some say its the best in Charlotte   !Solid salads  great portions The new menu (?) has a wide variety of delicious burgers ,positive,969472
Full selection of their lines   Service was impeccable   Got exactly what i wanted   What more would you expect from a top of the line brand  with top of the line merchandise?  Asked for the full selection of their mens wallets  the salesman showed them all highlighting the features of each  and made deciding easy ,positive,1304793
From the outside this place doesnt look like anything at all  its in kind of a funky strip mall  Once you go inside even at the decor is not that great but once you order the food you will be very very surprised  We had the pizza a couple weeks ago and it wasnt to my liking but a lot of people really like it  But last night I had the linguini with White clam sauce and I was just blown away  It was so good  huge portion  super flavorful and the pasta tasted like it was homemade but Im not sure that it is  Really really friendly people looks like a family organization so Im always happy to support local business  And they have Coke products which is important to me if you read my reviews  Again kind of a weird do you know off the strip funky kind of place but if you have a car looking for straight up Italian and not a lot of pretense or even that nice a place then this is the place to go ,positive,1300764

When I got here around 10pm on a Monday night there was a line!

So theyre pretty friendly at this location   They just rush you Im sorry I dont have the menu memorized and sometimes I like to try new mixes  I asked the girl closing my bowl if the bowls got smaller she laughed and said not really  Then everyone in the prep line said no maam our bowls are the same size (like theyre coached to say this ) I could barely see the rice and they drizzled on the sour cream  It was at That moment I wouldnt dare ask to add my avocado in fear theyd charge me a dollar for a corner spoon  Ps the rice was hard,negative,4520675
This used to be a nice place to live with helpful office staff  Once Tyler was moved to a different property it went downhill quick  Office staff is incompetent and has never once returned my phone calls  The work orders they wrote were no where close to what I requested and I lived with a clogged kitchen sink for three days until my boyfriend came and fixed it for me  It was incredibly frustrating dealing with the staff  the rent was raised without any notice  we are charged for gas when my apartment has no gas  I felt like a number and not a member of the community  Im so happy to be done with this place and two of my other friends are on their way out too due to the same issues  Its a shame  if they would have treated me better I would have stayed indefinitely ,negative,5610211

Amazing burgers! I came here with 5 other foodies and we were very impressed with the freshness of beef and fries  We shared the frenchie and fungus humongous burgers  The meat is so tender and juicy  Its not greasy  The fries are cut fresh too! The restaurant was only open 6 days and I wanted to try something new and unique as far as burgers go  and this place earned all of our stars ,positive,268284

Ate there last night with my wife and another couple  The meal and service was good  The other couple had the scallops and a steak dish  my wife had scallops as well and I had the crispy duck all were delicious   We split the bill with the other couple  Our portion meal totaled $120  I used an Amazon voucher which had a $50 value and the resturant forced a tip on the meal  When I asked why I was forced to pay their preset tip I was told it was a company policy if you used a voucher i e  Groupon they automatically place a tip on the order  I will not be going back to this resturant when there are so many other choices that do not force a tip on you when our meal was for a party of two ,negative,375655
I live and work in the area  so Ive been coming here at least twice a month for a couple of years   Why?Amazing and consistent food Great buck an ounce wine   Both the red and white are very drinkable My faves: The Polipo or Cavolo Nero as a starter   And my goto main  depending on my mood  is either the burger  salmon or steak   The BF always  always orders the Bucatini al Ragu  while my vegetarian friends swear by the Mafalde ai Funghi pasta It can get a little loud during lunch and dinner  but its not because of blaring music  which helps My only wish is that theyd offer grilled calamari as a side option for the salads  the same way they do at sister resto Trattoria Nervosa   Then again  Nervosa doesnt offer buck an ounce wine   ,positive,2364068
A no frills  order at the bar  cash only place with a friendly staff  great bar vibe  excellent local beers and a nice sized menu containing the Walnut Burger   The best burger I have ever had in my life   and I have had it many many times  If the Atwood neighborhood had to be summed up in one place  this would be the one ,positive,113710

Ive been coming to this place for over 5 years (mostly including the location at baseline and higley) and that should be explanation enough for the 5 stars  I dont venture much past my usual steak potato cheese burrito  but Ive had their sides of rice and beans  horchata  and both red and green salsa (careful  that stuff is addicting)  and Ive never left regretting I went  Its $5 bucks for the best  most fresh and most consistently DELICIOUS burrito you can find north of the border  Id take this over filibertos any day of the week  Also  Did I mention that red salsa      They recently remodeled the Gilbert rd location and its lookin great  Its got places to sit  unlike the other location at baseline and higley which is connected to the circle K outside  with a pair of concrete tables with umbrellas to sit at  not bad on a nice day  Im probably going again this week  my mouth is literally watering now after writing this ,positive,2980441
We enjoyed the tour of Frank Lloyd Wrights winter home in Phoenix  Our guide  Samantha  was very knowledgeable  friendly and provided great insight on the creative genius of Frank Lloyd Wright  one of the worlds great architects  Also  giving us complementary FLW labeled bottled water was a nice touch  particularly on a hot summer day  However  we really wished we could have seen more of the property  like the kitchen and dining areas and also wished we could have been allowed to take pictures of the interior living areas  If we could have  we would have rated this tour as a 5 star attraction  Still  it is a worthwhile tour  despite its relatively high cost ,positive,5991969
I came here strictly for the $1 oyster happy hour  Boy was that a good call on my part  I sat at the oyster bar and ate 2 dozen oysters that were that days happy hour special and also tried 1 of each of the other 4 varieties that were regular price ~$3 each  All oysters were very fresh and tasty  I will be back there when Im out in Vegas next time ,positive,1935689
The food is excellent! I got a #1 along with udon noodles  The food tasted excellent with quality and freshness you could taste  Their variety of toppings and customization options also made my order even better fit to my taste  Excellent customer service as well! Employees were attentive and accommodating  I could tell they truly cared about my dining experience  which was honestly refreshing as other places dont really care  The atmosphere and environment of the place were also great!

Delicious breakfast area  would recommend this place all friends and family ! If your looking for a good coffee and breakfast In my opinion beats your regular ihop or Dennys   The food and service is on point   kitchen knows what they are doing and cashiers are so kind and sweet   Big spot to enjoy with family and they just added a whole back seating area   where I personally like to sit   good vibes and good music,positive,851757
Ryan is absolutely amazing  I am terrified of short hair because of my childhood haircuts but I really wanted Long A line Bob  Spur of the moment today I got the courage to go to the last place I had gotten my haircut (over a year ago) and low and behold the only person available was Ryan  She actually was the one who had cut my hair and I knew it was meant to be  Not to long later I looked in the mirror and almost cried  I absolutely love my hair and couldnt have found a better stylist  It turned out so awesome my 5 year old daughter screamed her little head off and said she wanted to do it too  Ill be back for sure and would recommend this salon to anyone ,positive,4360487
Fresh  handmade pepperoni rolls      oh yeah  Their cheesy focattia  (did I spell that right?) is amazing  Take it home  throw it in the oven  drizzle a little EVOO on top and youre golden  Friendly people there  Parking sucks  but Im not taking off a point for that! p s  Their marinara is deelish,positive,1283662

The Madison will whip you into shape in just a few weeks  I have always been into fitness but The Madison is where I took a few of my first cycle classes and I love it!Being new to spin  I was a little nervous going there but they made me feel extremely comfortable  The instructors always offer to help with setting up your bike and getting ready  The music is always so fun and it is a hard workout  but the energy in the room makes it fly by so quickly  No matter if you are new to cycling or a pro at it  I think you will love this studio  I highly recommend it!!,positive,4744458

We have been going to Sakura on and off for several years    The sushi has always been very good and we recently went there with our daughter for hibachi and the food was also very good Maybe its just me  but the atmosphere is such a turn off    This place is always practically empty  which is just so odd to me    There are so few restaurants in Brecksville that you would think there would be more guests If they make the atmosphere a little more trendy it might attract more business    Or maybe Im the only one who feels strange eating in an empty restaurant   Its too bad cause the food and service has always been very good ,neutral,6036906
Nothing as Mexican food two hard tacos that tasted crap!!! Not too happy with my order and rude customer service in the drive Thur  It looks like the lady  was in a bad mood unable to explain the menu    sorry I wouldnt go back  I will rather go to McDonalds    thats how bad experience was   the lady charge extra cause I paid with debit card but my receipt said I paid cash!?!?!,negative,3957579

Absolutely AHMAZING!!! She is by far the best stylist Ive been to in years! Ive gone to her a couple times now  The first time I went to her she helped me get out some horrible tape in extensions  It was a mess but she made sure I left happy and most important  my hair was healthy! Shes amazing! Truly does the best for her clients  Im so glad I found her ,positive,146294
This place needs more love from other yelpers  Really  Its been a while and they only have 7 reviews  After learning that Mirch Masala was closed down  I was sad  This place has left some good impression in me  The food is good and the lady owner is nice too  So  I was ecstatic when they finally reopened on State street  Yay  It is even closer to my apartment  State street needs some Indian restaurant and woohhoo: Mirch Masala is here  If you are craving for some Indian food in the middle of the day  come to MM for their lunch buffet  They have a quite selection of menu  Not the best  but it is pretty decent ,positive,5531142
The food was fantastic! The service was exceptional  They made sure we had what we needed but did not hover  I had the chow fun noodle dish with pork and beef and my husband had the chicken lo mein  Both were fantastic!

Just had lunch here   The service was very good   The food was served relatively fast   And it was very good   I had the pad thai  the wife had the oranged seared chicken and both were fantastic The daughter had the California mango rolls   Im not a roll fan but these were very good!!Ill definitely come here again,positive,3336337
I like Panera  Its overpriced but I already know that walking in the door  However what I dont need is rude and overpriced  Im a nurse  sometimes my job is rough and I all want to do is go grab a quick sandwich and soup   Not be talked to like Im a toddler who needs disciplined   Thanks to an older lady named DIANA  the rudest Panera employee Ive ever encountered I wont be patronizing this store anymore,negative,2345345

Came here on a Sunday with a friend for brunch and had a couple of things to share  We are both super indecisive people  so we took it upon ourselves to look at the menu beforehand to speed up the process  which usually takes over 15 minutes and servers coming to check on us multiple times haha   Brisket: expected a huge platter for $25  but smaller than expected  That said  it was very filling (meat is heavy)  and the brisket was meltinyourmouth soft  no dryness whatsoever! The sauces that accompanied the brisket were also quite unique  some espresso flavour that had an interesting taste  Hueveros Ranchos: this was a skillet of spicy pork  black bean  fried egg  and taco shells  I think this dish was pretty normal  nothing too standout (not like the brisket!)  It also came with some Pico de gallo  which was good  I normally dont like tomatoes  but I liked these Carbon Bar was definitely a great BBQcentric brunch to start off the Sunday food adventures!,positive,665736
If youre looking for something good to eat with reasonable delivery times look els where  So I placed an order a few weeks ago  it took a while for just a gyro & pasta anyway left a good tip  open everything up & the gyro meat was so dry it must have been sitting out for hours  the cucumber sauce was terrible  It was almost like they just put scraps of cucumbers in sour cream  The pasta was poorly prepared  in a layer of oil  Called back right away  Was assured Id have a credit under my phone number  So I let it go  tossed the food for the dogs & made something  Went to give it another shot today  turns out my credit was never put in to the system  The gentleman on the phone did however offer a credit anyway but after remembering what I got last time & that my credit was neglected I had to turn down the offer  Will never order for this business again unless it is under new management ,negative,3160095
Finally  a great place to get breakfast that isnt Dennys or iHop in Gilbert  Came here with my family and we just made it before the change in menus  The griddle bread pudding was AMAZING!

HORRIBLE   First time customer and LAST TIME   I just got one of the saddest worst pizzas Ive gotten in long memory   I just moved from SoCal  I know good pizza   Getting a frozen pizza from the store would have been more tantalizing to the look and taste buds They said 45 mins  came in 50 and pretty much cold   I was supposed to get their signature pie North End   Its super thin  little sauce and cheese and wheres the meat?  I asked her for something meaty   This pizza needs to go on the Wall of Shame and Im writing the manager through Yelp to request a refund   Whoever runs this pizza needs to go eat some REAL pizzas and get a grip   This pizza is shameful I was trying to figure out why their reviews are all over the place   NO ONE could think this pizza is great   They must be putting up Shill Buyer reviews,negative,1621652
We left our kitten with Scaredy Cats Hospital/Boarding to be neutered and boarded while we were out of town   Everyone at Scaredy Cats were very kind and loving towards our cat  which I really appreciated since I was so far away and concerned about him   I was called when his surgery was over  and told that he was doing well (which I was thankful for)  I boarded him in one of the catsitas  which he loved because he had a lot of extra room and kitty towers to play with   Melanie was even sweet enough to send me an email letting me know how he was doing  too   When I picked him up  the girls hugged and kissed him goodbye   It was so sweet to see  and it just reaffirmed that we would definitely board him there again   Thanks for everything!

AYCE sushi for $25  As good as can be expected We started with the seafood salad prepared spicy which was our favorite dish  Theres a heaping portion of cubed and sliced sashimi of tuna  yellowtail  and salmon  The spicy sauce was slightly tart and did not overpower the fish  We also had some sashimi  Harry potter roll  hamachi kama  wet dream roll  and the soft shell crab appetizer (which was overlooked)  You can have one mochi and two icecreams per person with the all you can eat  We enjoyed a chocolate mochi  vanilla mochi  and a plum ice cream ,neutral,141564
I went to a fabulous corporate retreat here and even as a group of spa junkies we were seriously impressed ! A few highlights:*They were able to hook my group up with a wine room  The wine was free flowing and you could carry it around the spa with you  AHH sitting in the hot tubs sipping wine and champagne was truely amazing *While I didnt have the goofysounding crystal massage healing experience thing  everyone that did said it was life changing and they felt really emotionally charged and happy after leaving it  It sounds a bit newagey for me  but people seemed to genuinely love that treatment *I had a facial and the lady went above and beyond  She really customized the treatment to my skin  This was 4 days before my wedding and she left my skin looking awesome Overall   despite it being smaller  I prefer this place to Canyon Ranch  My fingers are crossed that Im forced to retreat here for work again !,positive,2825092
This is probably my favorite LA fitness to go to  Friendly people  Aside from the people that work out I would give this a low rating cause its pretty dirty and gross  Locker rooms stink  Old equipment  They need to just revamp the place  or move it somewhere else Staff is always friendly  Only complaint is the cleanliness ,neutral,5319542

This buffet is priced pretty much the same as the rest of them  and includes unlimited wine and beer  We picked this buffet because we were staying at the The Mirage  and they also had a better quality beer included in the price  There were a lot of options for people without any dietary restrictions  Vegetarians watch out! I talked to the chef and he told me that even the dishes marked as vegetarian contain chicken powder!!! The CHEF told me this! He didnt seem to care at all that this of course makes any vegetarian items not safe for them to eat  I spent the whole night and next day sick from eating chicken  which I am allergic to  This practice of adding meat to items clearly marked as vegetarian is dangerous  Who knows what else is hiding in their food ,negative,5168554

Ive been here many times and each time I come they charge me a different price  Today I think they charged me $5 to remove polish from one nail  They are always seem moody and rude  I dont know whats happened in the nail industry  but whatever happened to being polite  I was here NYE for my bday and the girl doing my nails sat and talked on the phone the entire time!

I visited American Commodore after a terrible experience at Mens Warehouse  I wanted to rent a navy suit for my wedding  and was going to pick out some averagelooking suit when the associate at the North Olmstead location came over and quickly talked me out of the suit I was looking at  She recommended a much more tailored tux due to the athletic build of me and my groomsman  Thank goodness for her  as the tux she picked out was way more flattering and was even less expensive! The entire tux package was way less than we expected  and I only had to pay $20 as the groom! I was already very satisfied with my experience with AC  but they really out did themselves when I ripped my pants taking pictures THE DAY OF THE WEDDING! Literally minutes before the ceremony  someone showed up on site with new pants for me  I couldnt believe it! They totally saved the day  and it was one of the best experiences I have had as a customer  I would HIGHLY recommend American Commodore from now on!,positive,2679929

Ive had PopEyes before and survived  but this was downright awful Had the #11 Shrimp & Fish  For $7 99  the portion came with a handful of shrimp and 1 piece of fish  Not very generous   The shrimp was good but I think they caught the carp from the lake behind my house and battered in their kitchen  It left the worst aftertaste in my mouth for a good five minutes  Terrible  just terrible  Had to throw it away and head out to McDonalds to satisfy my appetite  Nice knowing you PopEyes!

Oh dearrrr!! This place is amazing  From the food to the service! We had coconut soup as an appetizer  It fed 3 starved persons  We then had green duck curry and yellow duck curry  The whole meal was delicious  Everything was tasty  We were surprise when we received the bill because we expected it to be way higher   It turned out to be 45$ for 3 persons  The waiters were adorable  We will definitely come back!!!,positive,3992409

This place has a very enticing aroma that wafts around the corner of St Clair and Christie  Upon arriving at the shop  you are greeted by an abundance of delicious looking treats within a quaint setting  I have only tried one of their savoury scones (dill  chive and cheddar) and I have to say that it left something to be desired  I felt the flavour was lacking  it really needed that punch one would expect from cheddar cheese and the flavour of dill was completely absent  However  you can te that the ingredients are fresh and good quality (lots of butter) In terms of texture  the middle was soft  but the outside was a bit hard and chewy  If you are expecting a good English style  crumbly scone  this is not it  Perhaps a return trip is necessary to try their sweet scones  maybe they are the best ones ,neutral,5400916

Got no complaints  I showed up here for a lunch alone during a conference and the special was a braised pork taco plate  I checked the toppings closely (dont eat tomatoes or weird things) and it sounded great  As soon as I was seated someone brought me chipotle salsa  which I devoured (two of them!) with chips  When the tacos came out  there was guacamole on them & I was so confused  It said it nowhere on the description  Id already ate the beams but he immediately took it back and had them remake it (even more beans and yummy rice!) THe ambiance was upper scale mexican  and I sat outside so I could look over at the Mandalay Pool area  The large fan will keep you cool enough and the seats are totally comfy ,positive,1397831
This was a great find during a short trip to Toronto  Fortunately one night we were staying near the airport so stopped at this place for dinner  It was a welcome change from the cramped eateries in downtown  The ambience was great I had soup of the day  the power house bowl with freekeh  and a macadamia tiramisu to go  Everything was exceptionally good!,positive,5615466
Lets get straight to the point: The quality of the food is above average  but the quantity is definitely below average (this is me comparing it to other Chinese restaurants of its type)  The waitress suggested the Mongolian beef and it was definitely amazing  but the platter had more onions than Mongolian beef  I also found it interesting that theres a sign that says for people to clean their tables after they are done eating  Sorry guys but this is MURRICA  And in MURRICA  we never clean after ourselves when we eat at a restaurant  We also solve our problems through massive bombings and guns            MURRICA!,neutral,3422424
This concept is a must do a least once  This place was a recent episode of Bar Rescue  We tried several items including the Bacon Candle what a unique concept (photo included)  A candle made from bacon grease which melts into a pool of balsamic vinegar as you soak up the goodness with hot flatbread squares! Also tried the Man Candy and the Bacon Wrapped Bacon  The group enjoyed the Strawberry Beer which they loved  Our server Christina was efficient and super friendly ,positive,5177873
I have literally NEVER tried something at south side that was short of absolutely delicious  Im a bit of a mac and cheese snobthey nail it with a creaminess that is just perfect  while still not being too runnyreally sticks to the noodles  I personally like to add chorizo  my boyfriend tried the buffalo chicken as a mix in and it was equally yummy  It seems like everyone pretty much agrees that one of their star dishes has to be the chicken and waffles  Theyre rightyou will not be disappointed!

We got the Buffet of Buffets Pass for this Vegas trip  so we had to try as many buffets as we can  We came to Paradise Garden Buffet the next morning for breakfast  First of all  I dont know why people even waited in line for this place  Secondly  I dont know why anyone would wanna pay the single Buffet price for this place neither  To quote my boyfriend on this place: it was low ass iHop quality food for high ass prices  I couldnt say anything here was worth making another trip down the buffet line for  The restaurant itself was old and outdated  The presentation of the food was served on steam tables like at a Chinese buffet  The flavor was lacking in ALL the food and desserts  If you get the buffet of buffets pass  I would skip this place  If youre looking to purchase and eat at a single buffet restaurant for your Vegas experience  I would DEFINITELY skip this one  No way would I pay $20 for a breakfast/brunch/lunch buffet here  Go somewhere else and get better food ,negative,6001277

Not a classy location  not the finest of bar furniture  but  the service and menu make up for some of those elements  I cant eat furniture  so the food and quality is more important than what I sit on  This establishment only ranks 3 stars because of some of niceties  However  if you want a decent drink and a wholesome meal this is a place to try  I will be returning in the future to see if my review holds up after multiple visits ,neutral,3917876
Luxurious East Asian food at its finest  The service was superb  The drinks were very creative and strong  The scene was very sexy   The location reminded me much of the nyc location only that it was much larger  This is a very expensive restaurant but worth the splurge if youre in the mood for Asian flavors and are planning on visiting the nightclub here as well   The roasted duck entree was definitely the super star of the night  Thanks!

From the eastcoast so when i relocated to vegas i had a hard time adjusting to how they made pizza out here  Then one day while walking from downtown  i decided to try albos since it smelled good and there were lots of people in the restaurant  The pizza is the best ive tried in vegas thus far!  you can tell the ingredients are fresh and they dont skimp on their products  The cashier and the cook are always nice when i come in  The carry out special is the best and i always get a wings on the side (they are sooo good)  i am a sauce person so when i tried the bluecheese it was fresh and not watery  This is my fav pizzeria,positive,1298942

Ive been coming here ever since I was a kid so this review is 15 years in the making When I want a clear  light and clean tasting broth Pho  this is the goto  Bonus: they use fresh noodles (most of the time) rather than the dried rice noodles  They dont skimp on the meats or the side veggies and herbs either Other than the Pho I love their Bun Rieu and a selling point is they serve it with the traditional topping of shredded banana blossom which is pretty rare! I will say for this particular dish Ive seen the economic effects  They used to serve it with several chunks of pork hock and a nice crab claw but now you get it with maybe one or two trotters  and the claw is reserved for their Banh Canh  Nonetheless the soup is still good as ever and Ill keep ordering it haha Lastly their Banh Yot/Cuon are great as well  never too starchy or thick  And their Iced Coffee is strong and dense!

Visited Hot Star on a weekday night for some delicious fried chicken  It is located on the second floor of Pacific Malls food court  I ordered the XXL Large Fried Chicken with plum seasoning along with a Green Apple Yogurt drink  My order was ready shortly after I ordered and I could tell it was freshly made since the chicken was piping hot and needed to cool down before I could start eating I loved the plum flavour as it tastes great with the chicken and was pretty flavourful  The chicken was juicy on the inside and crispy on the outside  The Green Apple Yogurt drink was refreshing and complemented nicely with the chicken  I know I will surely be back the next time Im craving for some crispy fried chicken!,positive,5868944

Like everyone else this WM Neighborhood market is conveniently placed  but whomever manages this place should be retrained or let go  There are only (2) lanes open  and the staff working the checkout are slow and little ghetto  I dont necessary need a hello and thank you    but I do cringe when I hear employees swearing at each other  especially when there are children around ,negative,3428962
Pork belly lollipops were amazing  Also I highly recommend the Rosss Caesar salad  Will definitely be back!,positive,4226001
I am so excited to have a local Panda Express! I love the chow mein! My children love the orange chicken  Service is very friendly  Just avoid the drive thru  it will take forever ,positive,1875976
Typical bar food  with not typical bar prices   I know its Vegas and most things are on the pricey side  but yikes $50 for lunch that was a Caesar wrap and a burger with no alcohol??  My bank account was not so thrilled   If it was $50 and outofthisworld tasty  Id be ok spending that much Waitress was super nice and had this lad back appeal to her  I appreciate when a waiter doesnt put on some OHMYGOD type of show and is just themselves and nice and not pushy  It is definitely in a good spot on the strip  right in the middle ,neutral,5746728
To start the wait is not as long as it seems or as the hostess state ( hostess not customer service friendly at all actually almost left due to them)   thank goodness we didnt because the server ( Maritza) has been one of the best in vegas her soft spoken voice and great memory is amazing   Thank you   On top of this all the food was great   hash browns not my fave but overall good food   we will be back and hope for better HOSTESS,positive,5678880
This is the only place I want to go for meatloaf  and for breakfast! Its so mouthwatering and visually attractive  thanks to the crispish roasted winter veggies and the madetoorder mashed potatoes (with cheeeeeeese!)   Their menu is extensive  but I cant quit this habit    dont wanna! The service is great as you may have several different waiters in a visit  The decor is warm and casual and the prices are reasonable  Also  its totally consistent   Its all good! Great  now Im hungry ,positive,5347958

Well Im afraid I cannot give a fair review  We arrived shortly after 8 PM and there were slim pickins left on the buffet and they werent in any hurry to put fresh food out  What little food I did try was OK  Will have to give it another shot at an earlier time I evening I guess  Very disappointed this time around ,negative,6196235
They have the slowest drivethru ever  regardless the time of day  I would expect an establishment close to the freeway to be a little more hasty with their service times  but I suppose thats in my own perfect world ,neutral,5129069
I had been wanting to go here for years  Im so glad I finally had the opportunity to come here  This was the best meal I had ever had! The service was amazing and the view for Las Vegas was very nice  As for the food  everything we ordered was amazing  We ordered   butternut squash soup  New York foie gras  baked lobster   king filet mingon with creamed spinach and mushrooms and potato gratin  This was our first time trying foie gras and it was unbelievably excellent! It is a bit pricey but worth every penny for the amazing experience and I cannot wait to come back!,positive,2130622
Smallest dance floor in the world  I had paranoid images of me being crushed against the railing  Yet  men still manage to stand there  not dancing  but checking out all the girls they will never ever have a chance of sleeping with  Grrr The club is over the top in every way  right down to the fire that shoots out of the strange contraption above the dance floor  Hang out by the pool and youll have more fun  I hate to sound cliche  but this place was so last year a year ago  Check out Body English or Pure for a better time ,negative,4468687
Ordered some food home today   Got the mijana meza which is a quite a combo of the appetizers   It was okay for me served with 3 sauces  hummus I felt it was a lil bitter  but the others were good   what I really liked was the desert knafeh I dont like it too sweet so it was perfect for me the 3 stars actually goes for the desert!!!! All in all not bad but will have to try a diff one next time  ,neutral,4112188
It was a busy Monday at Sephora!! I wanted to have one of the beauty artists to put on my strip lashes for me! I just love the Velour lashes and the artist told me about house of beauty lash glue!

If this is the best mexican in madison  then Ill not be eating much mexican  It is authentic  but there were bones in my chicken taco  which was somewhat bland besides that  I also ordered a torta and a pork taco  The pork taco had flavor  but the torta was light on meat and felt like a mouthful of bread  I didnt finish my meal  which is very unusual for me Edit: Adding a second star upon visiting the place in person  Good atmosphere  and the vegetarian dishes are solid  Just dont get the meat  basically ,negative,3114785
WOW! A huge selection of foods from all over the world  Plus all the beer and wine you can drink comes with the price of admission  Ask to sit in the back room and you get a great view of Vegas at night  Its not fine dining but definitely worth a visit ,positive,5887063
Who would have thought that chewy  slightly burnt  thincrust pizza could taste so good?Ive been to Libretto twice now  and loved it both times   I didnt have to wait for a table either time   Granted  I was in a party of two both times  and I arrived at 5:45 one night (Saturday) and 11:30 on the other night (Friday) Food and service were both very good  especially the eggplant pizza   Ive read other reviewers complaints about value  but I found that the pizzas are large enough to share  especially if you have an appetizer or dessert Two points of interest:1) They give you a postcard with your bill  which I promptly sent to my friend in Calgary to brag about how much better Librettos Napolitano pizza is than Pulchinellas   Dont worry  Alberta already hates Toronto  so theres no risk in gloating that our trendy pizza is better than their trendy pizza 2) I cant seem to figure out why this place is called Libretto   Any thoughts?,positive,6391969
Very juicy burgers  My husband got the Dallas burger and I got the green chilies burger both medium rare and crunchified (with chips)  They were the best burgers Ive had  Kicked Gordon Ramseys ass ten times over  Its funny because Bobbys is meant to be very casual  you just order at the counter and take a number and they bring you your foodbut the quality/flavor is soooo much better than Gordon Ramseys burger place (and I feel like thats meant to be fancier)  We also got the undecided (you get to pick 2 sides) and got regular fries and sweet potato fries also a pistachio milkshake because they were out of the Mississippi mud pie  Good but it kinda tasted more like vanilla  Overall great experience ,positive,5839974
I went to RnR with friends  The food was decent  service was average  If you want to get drunk here you will probably get better service since the bar is always busy  Otherwise  I would say this is a good place to go and get breakfast  lunch  and dinner as long as you dont mind the drunk type around you screaming every few minutes ,neutral,2822845
Spent  almost three hours here looking at everything   especially the nooks and crannies for specialty items  I took and lunch break    and the lunch and breakfast menu was really good and healthy and   very reasonable!

There were GREAT deals throughout the whole store!! Every where I turned I saw signs saying 50% off    wowzers!!! Now thats what Im talking about :) The staff was very accommodating even going in the back to check for certain sizes that were not found in the store  They were very welcoming and I can not wait to visit again!!!,positive,5082299

My wife saw an article about this new Skrimp Shack so we decidedly give it a try   They have a good size menu of shrimp and various fishes which they fry up for you   Their menu includes sandwiches and po boys  baskets  dinners and they will even put them in tacos! fried oysters  clams  and many other choices along with a variety of sides   There is a kids menu too   We had a fat combo and a kids chicken sandwich  The food was good  fried just the right amount   The restaurant was busy and the staff seemed like they were still getting the hang of it   The ice machine must have been broken (there was a sign no ice) and most of the fountain drinks were out of syrup   The tea was fresh (and still hot)   The restaurant was clean and new  and  had a few tables but not enough for the line of folks that kept pouring in   Overall a good dinner  and we will give it another chance to be great once they have had a bit of run time ,neutral,3839652
While the food is excellent and the drinks are what you can expect from a martini bar  the service is the worst in Cleveland  My wife and I stopped in after a Cavs game on a Friday night to get a couple martinis and maybe an appetizer  It literally took 32 minutes before we even got a water  at which point we proceeded to get up and leave  We will not be returning here and never recommending it to family or friends!!,negative,6384654
Enh  I had such high hopes for this place  The produce can be cheaper than most places  But most everything Ive ever purchased here has been disappointing Selection is mediocre Theres just nothing wonderful about this place  despite all the hype when they opened Stick to Glaziers  Whole Foods  or Trader Joes ,negative,984748
It is a relief coming here and knowing that they have my best interest at heart  I appreciate their honesty and never feel like they are trying to sell me something I dont need  Mark has been wonderful and helpful every time we have come in whether it is just for a flat repair or something much bigger  So happy to have finally found a tire shop I can trust!,positive,3208004
We visited LoLos today and it was amazing  We are from Los Angeles and would normally get our chicken and waffels from Roscoes  We went in with high expectations and Lolo s was on point  Definitely won take that match  We ordered chicken wings and waffles which were delicious  My daughter ordered the oreo pancakes she said they were Amazing  They had koolaid and it too was amazing   The only bad thing was the catfish bignets they lacked flavor  Overall 4 stars would have been 5 if it werent for those flavorless bignets,positive,6126510

Like all the other reviews will say   this is literally the innout for Vegans! Finally I can have a burger and fries and feel healthy but guilty afterwards! They also have other Vegan fast food items such as tacos  a chikn wrap and popcorn chikn!

Im by no means a fan of Olive Garden  but I had a gift card burning a hole in my pocket and it happened to be endless pasta bowl time so theres no better time to visit We arrived at lunch time and were quickly seated and our waitress arrived to take our drink order  She was very pleasant and friendly  We ordered and our soup  salad and bread sticks arrived swiftly  Our pasta arrived with perfect timing as our salad and soup were being taken away  The food was decent  Not the best Italian  obviously  But itll do in a pinch and you always know what youre going to get  Service was topnotch and we never had to flag down a waiter or waitress to refill a drink or replace a fork  Everyone  including the people who brought out our food and the hostess were warm and friendly  Service is what gets chain restaurants higher marks in my book ,positive,2910844
Serious gnat issue !! While the food is good waving away gnats for the entire meal as well as dead ones on the wall raises questions as to the cleanliness of this place  They seem well aware they have a problem since the response when I mentioned it was simply I know  ! If you know you have an issue then why not address it ? Maybe someone from the health department should try and eat a meal there and see how gross the gnat issue is !,negative,4401193
This is my main haircut location  I like coming here because every time I come everyone is so courteous  and they always treat you with respect I like getting my hair cuts from Ana  she is a very sweet person and she knows how to Cut my hair just right  She likes to have nice conversations with you and is just a very pleasant person to be around So if you find yourself in North Las Vegas and are looking for a good haircut place  try the great clips on Losee I think you will feel right at home ,positive,5289554

Wow! I was blown away by this place  My other favorite Greek Restaurant was closed so I had to find a substitute  What a great place  The Dolmas were out of this world  They were the kind that I grew up with  I have been looking for these for years  The Gyro salad was Huge and very meaty  It was enough to split between two of us I will definitely be driving the extra distance to eat at this place again Staff was extremely friendly and made you feel at home ,positive,6467913

Get there early! Just as the name has you presume  you can checkout yard games; they have paddles and balls for pingpong and Foosball or cornhole sets to play in their covered/enclosed but outdoor patio areas  Tip: try the paper bag special  you pay $1 95 and they pick a random beer and hand it to you  yes  covered in a paper bag P S  Try the pretzel bites with cheese fondue ,neutral,1324458
Just visited this place again  It continues to go downhill  Their Clam Chowder is nothing more than thick pasty flour with potato hunks  I defy anyone to taste any clams or seafood  The crowd has gone down  you will never have trouble finding a seat now  In fact  they enlarged by adding the casino space at the front  which is always empty for the most part  Whatever happened to the old diner before DuPar took over  along with the delightful deli in back of the casino  Sad  sad  sad ,negative,3356315
Nothing special  really   The prices were great  especially the $5 Sake Bomber special   But overall  the food was just not sexy at all ,negative,3961315

This place is a gem in the Annex   The girls who work there are pros at making you feel beautiful from head to toe   The music is awesome   I dont know what I would do without the massage prior to every cut (you dont get it if you are getting color due to the reaction of the essential oils with the color )  Jen is my girl but theres Angela and Francine as well who are both awesome If you are dissatisfied with your current stylist  book an appointment at InI and you will not be disappointed ,positive,5424860

Food was great  insanely good crab cakes  just the best Id ever had  Huge portions Servicenot what I expected from an Alevel steak house  The server said they were shortstaffed  Hey  thats not my problem  your management needs to make things run smoothly even when youre shortthe diners should never ever know   One party ordered a martini and was told hed have to wait while they washed more martini glasses  Ick  Our other guests said their drinks were pretty darn weak  Table wasnt bused as I would have expected  Utensils not replaced properly  And theres a hostess chick  at least thats what I think she was  that keeps wandering by wanting to make conversation  And just standing there when were obviously making our own conversation or wed like to eat while our meal is hot  I might go back  but might just try one of the gazillion other restaurants in Vegas ,neutral,1232606

My favorite hair guy got a bartender job that he liked better than cutting hair  so I suddenly found myself without a person to cut my hair  I put off getting a hair cut for six months  but I finally couldnt go any longer  I booked an appointment with Jessica after seeing all the positive reviews  What a mistake!I told Jessica it had been six months since my last hair cut  so make me look good again! She proceeded to cut of maybe a years worth of hair off  At any rate  I went from long hair to a buzz cut in the short time I was with her  She did ask me once if it was ok  but then kept going shorter and shorter and shorter  I think she was having fun at my expense Never again  Boulevard Salon ,negative,3704159

Ive been to Serendipity 3 in NYC and this for me was a disappointment  The restaurant was too busy and the wait too long  so we got takeout  The Frozen Hot Chocolate was Ridiculously expensive for what it was served in a lame plastic cup  It also took Forever for them to complete our  orders  *lame* and overrated,negative,3020310
This unassuming little joint is located on Temperance Street west of Bay Street   The entrance is in an alleyway and its a bit sketch  but dont let that turn you off   The interior of the restaurant is pretty modern and trendy and seemed like a good place for a sitdown with friends  but I had takeout so I didnt get to experience it The place is basically a noodle / stir fry joint  think Thai Express   You select your protein  noodles  sauce  herbs  and any additional toppings or items   I went with the chicken hokkien noodles on spicy thai sauce with all the herbs   The dish was definitely a step up above food court meals with the tender chicken well grilled and overall package delicious   However I will admit that it was a bit salty for my tastes and for the price ($14)  the portion size wasnt anything special I would definitely come back once in awhile with some friends (theyre now open later to 9PM!)  but its nothing Id go out of my way for ,neutral,5609062
Years later  I still love this place Can be pretty busy  depending on the hotel occupancy levels  Service is consistently good  as is food quality  The lox platter is my favorite  but the house doughnuts are also fantastic  I and my dining companions have never been disappointed with any order over several years  Great coffee  good outdoor seating area ,positive,6500905
Okay  so food was good  Just hated how dirty the restaurant is  Its kind of crazy that it was this dirty when there wasnt a lot of customers and staff just walking around or not even visible at all  This is my third time coming back here and I hoped maybe every time I came that things would change because I do love Dennys but  sad to say I wont be returning to this Dennys  wish them success tho ,negative,4027245

This place is awesome! The pho is unbelievable and the service is top notch  My gf doesnt eat pork  so we asked if the spring rolls could be made without the pork  Our server asked another lady if that was ok and she smiled and kindly said that it could be done The service staff was even friendly with another customer who requested a large table for 12  separate checks  and who also kept asking if their orange juice was fresh This is definitely the place to go if youre craving pho ,positive,5452263

As a Platinum member  who has stayed to many nights in hotels  this is one of my least favorites  The front desk seems nice but really dont care about your status and puts out the minimalist of service  The hotel is old  terrible pool  and to access the pool you need to go through the front parking lot  The amenities are laughable and again insulting  no concierge lounge  10 dollars credit towards a drink which cost twice as much or the 500 bonus points which have not increased in at least 20 years  Marriott is becoming equal to a low end Holiday Inn ,negative,339522

I look at this mess of a board to see where they are   As I am looking (30 seconds no joke) she tells me whenever you decide what you want  tell me   She walks away angrily and goes back to the drive thru   We were the only customers in the lobby maybe 2 cars in the drive thru   I wait 5mins for her to come back and place an order   I waited 15 to 20 mins for 3 basic breakfast burritos   It was over $3 per and it was no better than filibertos   The lady was extremely rude as if her customers inconvenience her establishment  The food was average at best (3 stars)   Id rather not bother ever going back to that place due to her attitude (1star)   Ill make the drive to Carolinas and get really good food at better prices with great service ,negative,4331838
This is definitely my favourite takeout food in Calgary  very friendly people and service is outstanding  I go quite often  I always have the beef donair  I highly recommend it  quite often I will drive 20 minutes or more out of my way just to eat here ,positive,5260722
So we come here to order  We order and they hand us our cups to fill up our drinks  The people were somewhat short with me when I asked if they had any cups for the salsa bar  She points at one line cup about the size of a medicine cup  The chips are mediocre store bought chips  He salsa is very good  the enchiladas were very good  My carne asada was decent but dry  If youre Mexican they brink your drinks to you  Im not a discriminator and hate discrimination  It doesnt feel nice on our end either ,negative,4525269
I absolutely adore this place  It reminded me of the small places in Phoenix I used to frequent with my family  Its small  cash only  quiet  and delicious  The pork is mouthwatering  I love the chow mein (get it Hong Kong style and ask for the crispy noodles)  The price is right  so my coworker and i had dinner here about 3 times while we were in Las Vegas on business ,positive,1814615
Every hot sub I will ever have after eating at firehouse sub will probably NEVER compare    and if it stood a chance  itd have to be on its game! My first sub here was the New York Steamer which comes with Corned beef brisket  pastrami  melted provolone  mustard  mayo  and Italian dressing   I always get my subs Fully Involved (everything on it)  This is AMAZING! Their corned beed brisket is to die for!  This was my favorite until I fell in love with their Italian    Try it and youll see why  Their Italian comes with Genoa salami  pepperoni  Virginia honey ham  melted provolone  Italian dressing  and seasonings  Its perfectly well put together    every savory meat  veggie and seasoning in there compliments each other perfectly   Very generous portions    This is seriously my goto sub sandwich spot! Theres also many hot sauces to choose from if you wanna add a kick to your sub!I highly recommend this place!,positive,999067
Dominoes Pizza    weve each other for a long time  Sometimes things werent so great  but often times things were fantastic  Weve spent long periods of time together  and then theres days where we dont go a second without seeing each other  Sometimes  you do see other people and thats okay  I know whenever I need you  youll be there  Youre not perfect  and neither am I  Thats what makes us perfect for each other Im getting older  Dominoes  I need some stability in my life  Youre my rock  my crutch  Youre the only one I ever want  Sure  Pizza Hut said theyd be there for me  but who always rushed to my door when I needed something quick  It was you  No ones ever done that as well as you Youre smart  sweet  caring  and delicious  Those other pizza stores never mattered to me  you were my main goal  I love you Dominos Pizza ,positive,911770
Cant for the life in me figure out how this place has eeked out 4 stars  I give it 1  Ate here for lunch  Very limited menu at lunch  We ordered the carbonara bucatini for $23 a plate  Next to no sauce and only a few chunks of pancetta  Had to flag down the waiter and order more sauce  Garlic bread appetizer came as 3 slices of dried out cheese bread with I swear not an ounce of garlic taste to it  The next table to us ordered garlic bread also and got 4 slices; not that I WANTED more but really     Place looks nice and clean however ,negative,702172
This place is so delicious but watch out with the Asian lady that prepares your order    if the order is wrong she gets an attitude if she gets it wrong   also the girls that take your order are new sometimes and slow,positive,5508559
I have eaten at this place for years  The best Chicago Pizza in the valley  They have had a commercial on TV showing their baked clams  They looked great  So I drove across town to try some  Well it is twelve dollars for ten clams so at a dollar twenty each they should be larger than the size of a walnut shell  They were worth about half that much  I told the waitress and her response was we cant control what the supplier gives us  So I went to the owner  He said he didnt like the bigger ones they are too ruff  He began to tell me where these extremely small clams came from  In other words he could care less that a long time customer wasnt happy about getting ripped off for twelve dollars for the smallest clams you have ever seen  From now on Ill stick to their pizza ,positive,2242926
Had a great experience with ABC Glass  They were honest  fair and provided great quality work  They were able to match my existing windows with replacements that were perfect  The installers arrived on time and performed with experience and skill  They also left the job site clean  We  were so pleased with the work performed in our home that my husband recently contracted with them to buildout the new office space for his company  We would recommend ABC Glass to anyone needing glass work ,positive,1632138
This place is pure garbage  In my mind  bad service can be pardoned if the food is good  There was nothing to excuse the bad service here  A slow and rude waitress awaits you here  She doesnt seem to want to take your food to you even though its sitting on the counter and youre the only customer here  Ask her a question and she rolls her eyes Onto the food   mediocre and not filling  If there was a contest to use as little meat as possible in a rare beef pho bowl  this restaurant has won it  Not only that  its pricier than other nearby pho restaurants in the city!,negative,5501674
We love this place! This is where I transferred my child after experiencing horrible childcare at a facility located along Silverado Ranch Blvd The care givers feels genuinely nice  Rooms are clean  There are curriculum posted on the walls  And they seem to be followed correctly because I randomly pick up my child on different times and caught them actually doing the activity listed  Happy child  Happy mom!,positive,6071450

HONEST REVIEW FOR MISS BRITNEYWhat I loved:Her production was absolutely breathtaking!Her dancers were sexy and gave us a fun show!She did all her hits which I grew up on and love!She looked HOT!What sucked:She lip synced but I can forgive that  Homegirl got old she was huffing and puffing and couldnt catch her breath  So Im kind of glad she was lip syncing!She danced like she was in rehearsal  Like  at least give us your 100% when u dance if youre not singing but no  she just did a few lazy twirls and jazz hands and walking around the stage  Boo for the fans who were excited to see her  Tip: spend the extra money and get seats in the front  THERE ARE NO SCREEN SHOTS OF HER PERFORMANCE  I couldnt see her facial expressions because our seats were middle tier and it sucked  The expensive seats  (by the stage) had the most fun It was fun for the bachelorette party but I dont think I will ever go to another Britney concert again ,neutral,1619539
SO SO AMAZING!! Everyone at this location is incredibly kind  they all greeted us as we entered  and had great recommendations as it was my first time!

So excited to come back soon !!!!!!!,positive,4363966
This place rules  I visit it every time I visit vegas  It is a hole in the wall  sketchy strip mall location and feels like it used to be a bar or something with the weird hallway entrance  They are open late and have an awesome late night happy hour  The staff is excellent and the food is great  They will make sushi off menu and will do a very thinly sliced japanese tuna that no other place has been able to get right for me  I have tried other menu items and everything has been great  good portion size and value to go along with the great service and quality ,positive,5536554
It pains me to give this such a low rating because it used to be very good  but in the past few months the quality of the service and staff has tanked  We used to go to this location often because its only 2 miles from our home  but are going the one at Scottsdale 101  which is much further away for us We just went tonight for the last time at this location  We were seated at a table that there was still did in the floor in plain sight  slow service  trying to pass a clearly different 1 000 Island dressing as their normal dressing while the color  texture & taste are different and a manager that lies to your face  Not to mention server assistants improperly carrying drinks & food when bringing it to the tables I actually would be happy if this location was closed and the entire staff was unemployed  The staff at this location dont deserve to be in the restaurant business ,negative,3216056

Lots of reasons to like whole foods first really clean and friendly staff  Knowledgeable in the supplement department  Dont be food not everything here is good for you  Just a much large selection than most places  You must decide whats good for you  I am torn when it comes to the deli and self serve bar  The breakfast selection is so so and always the same  Wish they had fresh salsa  avacado and cheese at the breakfast bar  Salad bar has more things than you could ever imagine  So all in all the bar is pretty good ,neutral,3466001
Beware if you have thick hair!!!!! So I just called to inquire about their services  I asked how much Liz charges and its $50  She asked about my hair   its curly thick hair  They up charged me to $60  Their excuse: because it takes longer to blowdry and go through it  I know my hair pretty well and its not that thick to charge me an extra $10  A quality salon wont up charge because they have to work harder  No business from this gal ,negative,562143
Choklat is a small little shop in Inglewood that is truly Calgarian  Because other than actually growing the beans in Canada  the entire chocolate making process is done in Calgary  Its more like a laboratory setting in there  as the mad scientists frantically transform cocoa beans into gold   Choklat only uses organic  fair trade cocoa beans  and uses the finest complementary ingredients from around the world My lady chose the newest deluxe chocolate bar from the display case  Based on her erratic movements and moans of pleasure  Im pretty sure she actually died and went to heaven for a moment  Its amazing that a slab of shortbread and caramel covered in milk chocolate could usurp my role as primary pleasuregiver  But  as the male species knows  chocolate is our main competition for a ladys heart  Premium chocolate is sold in large bars with varying prices  and features an extensive dark chocolate selection  which is all the rage right now ,positive,734761

We had a great experience buying a couch and loveseat here  The salesman  I think his name was Ray  was really patient with us and took us through the entire store  We narrowed it down to a couple of choices and went back and forth between them many times  And then we left the store and went to the Dump and Moore  We couldnt find anything we liked as much at either if those places so we went back  We opted to pay the $100 for delivery  it was confirmed the item was in stock and delivery was scheduled for Tuesday (bought on Saturday  Monday was Labor Day)  Items were delivered first thing Tuesday morning and we couldnt be happier  Everyone I have interacted with has been very polite and helpful ,positive,6007863

Pretty impressed with this coffee shop  Always ample amounts of seating and tables  Fire place makes it cozy  Coffee itself is pretty great as well  Black Americanos are my normal drink and they hand pull the shots and make it fresh  They recently added Paninis ( they call them Crushs) to their menu great addition  I just had the Caprese Crush  Delicious  They make the Paninis fresh and have a grill right there  Reasonably priced ($5  $6)  Only downside is the attitude by some of the baristas  Some of them can seem very aggravated and at times rude to customers  Only saw one of them smile in my 2 hours sitting there  But they all make great coffee so I dont mind the sour faces ,positive,4242945
I just found this place near my hotel  It is small but cozy place  I was here at lunch time  I got a vegetarian soup  And the flavor is superb  Very clean place  Friendly staff was advising me what taste good for my desires  They asked me many times if I liked what I ordered  Im definitely coming back here again to try something else  They supposed to get some vegetarian dumplings later which sounds great!,positive,2319239
Big scam  Avoid the low price  cause they will get you with a $50/day insurance if you dont have the correct personal coverage  Place just feels shady imho Reserved a luxury and they offer me a lower level car  Then I am told that is their luxury  but it was a tier down on the third party booking site  The people doing positive reviews must work there or have never rented a car before,negative,567621
These guys are the absolute best around  Nobody wants to have to take their car to the body shop  but taking it to Rob Wagner is a pleasure  They literally do walk you through the insurance process  You drop your car off and leave the rest up to them  Not only that  the work they do is top notch  Picked my car up looking better than it ever did  Very talented  dedicated body shop  Rob Sr  and Jr  are extremely professional and all around great guys  Looking forward to doing business with them in the future ,positive,5095786

Best froyo around  We love this location  but we recently discovered the location in Phoenix off of the 101    owner is so kind and conscientious  Mojo is one of the very few places that serve LIVE acidophilus     other places serve dead acidophilus  so youre not getting the full health benefits  On top of that  this yogurt is delicious!,positive,530903
Fantastic restaurant   Every meal Ive had here has been excellent   Great location  cool decor  very good bar ,positive,1094985
Cool decor  good location and decent food   That equals an AOK in my book   This place has funky dishes that are unlike anything you will find elsewhere   I had the cuban sandwich and it was great actually  a little on the dry side but nothing too bad   The decor like a said is cool  but like and ecclectic cool  strange even   I like that though and it kind of adds to the place   We sat out on the patio which looked like it may have been under repair because of the loose construction material around   Service was a little shakey with them forgeting that we need utensils and all around a tad bit slow but it sufficed   Ill be back probably ,neutral,771663
When in Vegas   spend $20 on drinks  Lucky we had buy one get one free  Which I guess evened out the playing field  Or paying field  The drinks were actually very creative  different and good!

A hot June 2018 stay proved pleasant and affordable Large twobedroom suites for about  $125 (summer blockrate) was ideal for an overnight minivacation  All rooms were roomy and clean  Having the dining/kitchen area separate the two bedrooms  provided privacy between grownups and youngsters too Free bfast has many options from a terrific omelet bar to mediocre prefabbed pancakes ,positive,102300
I made a reservation two weeks before for a Noon lunch for 3  inside  We arrived early  but were able to be seated  We had a spectacular view of the Bellagio fountains from our table  which was near the outdoor patio seating  but closer indoors  perfect location  Our server Peter was attentive and courteous  My guests had the Trout Almondine and Spinach Salmons Salad  I had the Chicken and Mushroom Crepe  It was all delicious  served at the right temperatures and expertly plated  Peter brought one of my guests a dessert with a candle  as I had told the reservation agent it was their birthday  Our beverages were never empty and it was a wonderful dining experience  Everything you would expect in an establishment such as this  Great service and cuisine  Next time I wont wait 9 years to return!,positive,2472185

Smaller than some of the other Vegas clubs I have been to which makes walking around kind of a pain  We got there at 11 and the dance floor was already completely packed  Luckily we made friends and got to sit at a table for the night with a great view of Jermaine Durpi  The music was great  the scene was great  the cocktails server was just okay but the clean up man was always there wiping down the table and rearranging cups  Thinking about it I dont know if I would come here without bottle service because of the lack of space but with bottle service  its definitely at the top of my list  Side note: There were many hot girls here  but also a TON of 2s and 3s thinking they were solid 7s and 8s  It was painful to look at  so painful for the eyes ,positive,4468616

Im starting off with parking  its terrible!The service is good  but last night was mediocre  younger male server  nice enough  but not what we are used to coming here  Felt rushed  The pricing  a bit on the very high side for Chinese food  And pretty much you have to buy things all separately The menu reads  you can and this  this and this for 5 95 extra  no worth even it  An egg roll  a fried shrimp and a tiny rib  The egg fo young was not hot  was made into huge patties  Typically flatter  The rice wasnt hot either  I do not frequent here because of the above but wanted Chinese and my place that I love was too far in the terrible weather we had yesterday  I doubt we will come back ,negative,2954522
Ate here once and I was instantly impressed with the atmosphere  The place is very clean  The staff was friendly  prompt and attentive  I had the General Tsos a k a Cho  Chicken  It was a portion for 2 but it made dinner for the next night easy  They could have eased up on the sauce a tiny bit (it was caked in it)  The Won Soup was awesome  Overall  I will definitely eat here again but I will be trying something else to expand my horizons  BTW this place has a MASSIVE seafood menu for all you seafood eaters ,positive,373769
Not only am I a fan of their products but now am a fan of their customer service department   Over the weekend  someone backed into my hitch mounted rack while I was out on a ride and  broke off one of the wheel holders   Although SARIS has a lifetime warranty on their products  I knew that that wouldnt apply in this case when I called to order a new part   When I described what happened  the customer service rep (Sam) empathized and said they like to support their customers and waived the replacement fee   As I pass by their office on the daily  I was able to stop in and pick it up on the way home   It is these little things that go a long way in my book     ,positive,3937453

I came back to Grind Burger to redeem my Groupon recently  I also notice that there is a coupon in the Entertainment coupon book that I look forward to redeeming as well  On top of the Yelp checkin offer  make sure you take advantage of one of these offers The food is still on par and I enjoy the ambiance for the most part  Still not a great fan of building my own burger  but I think Im starting to get the hang of it  I wish they would add pineapple as one of the topping options so I could build a proper teriyaki burger  All in all a good option for a meaty and juicy burger  minus their awkward location ,positive,1921036

I used think this place was kind of a dump    until I actually took a closer look  I kind of like how the walls are lined from ceiling to floor with a TON of product  The best thing is they stock a lot of brands that a lot other highend pets stores dont even carry  Much to my surprise  Evo  TikiCat (can NEVER find this in stock elsewhere)  and Stella & Chewys are a few brands found here that are rarely found elsewhere  They might not carry the entire product line  but its still a better selection than most can offer  As for small pets  they sell a decent variety of hamster  rabbit  gerbil  and guinea pig food in the back  They sell the Supreme line here (which recently got discontinued from PetSmart)  such as Harry Hamster!! The staff here are also friendly and helpful If cases of cat food stacked haphazardly does not bother you  this is the place! I dont even want to submit this review because now everyone will come here and buy all my TikiCat cans!,positive,2662009
Great food  great service  Had friends in from Western New York so we took them there for drinks and dinner  The food was fantastic and the wine selection was decent  however they could use some more beer choices  The owner came to the table to say hello which is a great touch  I highly recommend you go there for dinner  you will not be disappointed ,positive,1485969

Lots of fun  Husband and I did Xmas Eve dinner here  popular idea apparently  There was maybe a 40 minute wait  Typical crawfish style placebibs  paper tablecloth  shell cracker tool  bag of steamed shellfish  We got the 58 75 family dinner  lots of choices but we went with snow crab  clams  and mussels  It also came with red potatoes  corn on the cob  and delicious little chunks of  bratwurst  Great fun to eat and delicious  I wasnt too hip on the barbaric claw game with live lobsters but others were fascinated by it  Also some wasted space  tables were not being utilized  I would for sure come back ,positive,3465067
Interesting mix of gelato flavors that have some kind of Asian twist to them  While youre waiting in line you can ask to try any flavor you want so naturally I asked to try at least 8  Though tastewise it was pretty clear they were naturally made with real ingredients I wasnt a fan of classic flavors like black sesame  roasted oolong tea  or the peanut sesame  However  when I finally tried the whiskey green tea I fell in love  With so many matcha green tea ice cream places popping up in Toronto  this green tea gelato distinguishes itself with its smooth texture and punch of real whiskey  The two flavors actually work together extremely well and I felt the burn of the whiskey after eating only a few spoonfuls  Im a fan and if Im back in the area Ill be trying out some more flavors!,positive,3195857
SO happy that Kinton finally opened up in Scarborough! Five years ago I wouldnt have even dreamed of this  Now  I can get Kinton almost anytime since its 5min away from home  It opened a week ago and Ive been back twice so far  Original Pork ramen was excellent  The egg was not warm but the flavourful soup broth and perfectly al dente thick noodles made up for it  We also ordered Karaage  it was perfectly fried however lacking flavour  Also  noticed that the Karaage portion is smaller compared to the Richmond Hill location   then realized there is a massive price difference  Seems like each location has its own menus and pricing although the ramen seems to be all consistent  Comments for management:Because it just opened a week ago  service is a bit slow  We asked for hot water which never arrived and had to ask for cold water at some point during our meal  Also  please improve the seating priorities by planning ahead when there are groups of 4 waiting vs groups of 2 ,positive,4364372
Ive been to Yuukai twice and both times found the food to be a hit or miss and the bill to be somewhat painful for what you get Last year  I clearly remember having some amazing tuna tataki here that was probably the best Ive ever had at any restaurant  The veggie tempura was ok with nothing to write home about and the gyozas were just meh  Having kept this in mind when I returned here last week  I made sure to only order a few sushi rolls and try something new off the appetizer list  The rib appetizer was absolutely delicious  but my sushi rolls were just meh  For over $40  youd expect to get really great food but unfortunately Yuukai did not deliver once again I likely wont be back but wouldnt deter anyone from going  Service is good  and food is ok  The big plus is that its a BYOW so that may be a deciding factor for you!,neutral,3021548

Interesting name for a coffee shop   And even more interesting how its spelled   I hate to label this place  but its definitely hipster   I cant put my finger on it as to why    but it just totally screamed hipster when I walked into it   I ordered a latte  and holy geez it was expensive   I forgot to take a picture of the latte itself  but I did snap a picture of the menu because I was in shock as to how expensive my drink was   Deep down I was telling myself  its this expensive because it must be a good latte   And while it wasnt bad  it wasnt good either   In my opinion  definitely not worth the hefty price tag considering theres other coffee shops nearby that serve delicious coffee ,negative,3195877

Ive been going to SuperCuts and Great Clips pretty much my whole life  and the experiences have been more or less variable  I wanted to find a place that had people that actually took time and some sort of passion in working with their customers instead of attempting to empty the chair in less than 10 minutes (like most chain places)  I must say this place has won me over  Every piece of equipment that is used is top notch and done with precision and care  If youre looking for a place for quality cuts  check this place out! Ask for EZ,positive,2989556
Nothing like wandering around your small town to find this small hole in the wall bar thats as cozy as it can get! I started off with their special cole slaw  that is as refreshing as it is addicting  Then I tried the Reuben with Fries and I was in love  Then I finished it off with Pumpkin Pie  Ill definitely be back  and most likely a Sunday regular when its not very crowded  If youre in the area  you owe it to yourself to give it a shot ,positive,3959887
Messed the orders   Didnt get close to the food we ordered   Overpriced for the gamble on this place ,negative,3610339

I just tried this place for lunch with my friend and LOVED it! I had the Enchiladas de Dennis  which was recommended by the server  and ate it all up!

A great addition to the neighborhood! The owners & staff are very friendly and the cafe is comfortable and inviting  There are lots of cool details throughout the place  like the use of reclaimed wood & local artwork  Tried a few drinks  the black chai tea was delicious and the cafe mocha was a treat  Will have to try the nitro cold brew next time  Really enjoyed the brown bread and scones as well! Looking forward to going back soon  Thanks  5 Points!,positive,93355
I had to evacuate from Fort McMurray via road  I left with the clothes on my back and the contacts in my eyes (I wear dailies)  I was in dire need of contact lenses  I booked an appointment with Optiko (google search) on my drive over  for the following morning  The place had a very modern vibe to it  vibrant colors  plush seating  extensive eyewear collection  well placed counters and excellent associates  The staff and the owners were very courteous and respectful of my situation and even waived off the doctors checkup fee! Thats class  Excellent work  Thank you!,positive,2166539
I wasnt sure about this place at first   the menu is confusing and SEEMS limited   but when we actually showed up  the place was bumping and the food turned out quite well  The service was great   we had a 2 man team serving us  and one even escorted me to the ladies room  Kobe beef sliders  mixed green salad  the shake part of the shake and cake dessert (the brownie part was soso)  were all good  I really liked my cucumber martini ,positive,2785997

I stayed one night on dec  19  2014 to pick up my daughter from the las vegas airport  She was coming home for the holisays from college  Let me start by saying there was no fridge and no microwave in the room  and the front desk said 7 eleven was one block over and if i bought something in the store they might let me use it to warm watever food i brung in with me to warm up  WOW!! Unreal  Secondly  the carpet in the room was filthy dirty  The bathroom was nasty  The continental breakfast was awful  I will never  ever stay there again  The pictures on their website was nothing like it was  when i actually checked in the room  there was no towels in the room  I guess the only good thing i can say is they had free wifi and 24 hour coffee and hot cocoa which was actually good  I give this hotel one star ,negative,2606747

So learned that I love Japanese curry which I wasnt aware of myself  Oh curry is a small restaurant that w couple of friends always recommended it to me so I went and wasnt disappointed  Oh! Currys atmosphere is friendly and inviting  The staff greet me the moment I step in to the restaurant with a simple hello and a genuine smile  Im really picky about where I eat so it has to be clean good thing Oh Curry is spotless! The food is simple and delicious anything you choose is the right choice  The staff is every friendly even offering free kids meals w/ toys to families that have kids  My friends and I come to oh curry just about everyday just to hang out talk and play Pokemon  I wish more people knew about it,positive,4509014

Kabuto sushi is a great sushi experience  They offer several levels of omakase depending on your appetite and the selection of courses changes daily based on what they get  Eating here is a very serious food experience in some ways  The chef doesnt talk and the service is incredibly detailed oriented  The location is nice inside but easy to miss on the outside if you dont know what youre looking for  Cost wise  it is in line with other high end sushi experiences I have had and certainly was worth every penny  Would definitely recommend coming here  I suggest the middle omakase order if you dont have a big appetite or would like to order ala carte after the meal  The most expensive omakase option did include courses that were only available through that tier of omakase Protip: I made a reservation for right when they opened  but you could reasonably walk into the restaurant at 730pm or after and get a great seat for multiple people ,positive,3363110
Accidentally stumbled upon this place while walking around on a chilly night  Its cute and cozy  and right up my alley! I love Thai food because when I miss home food  Thai is the closest thing to it!  I ordered the tom yum kha and the spring rolls  I felt the portions were huge! Even though the soup was in the appetizer section and only 5$  I struggled to finish my bowl of soup  The soup had generous amounts of chicken  I got the spring rolls work shrimp  I felt like they tasted okay  Overall  I enjoyed the meal  And of course I am always faithful to Thai restaurants and will definitely come back to try more from the menu ,positive,169276

I had a pork gyro and the serving size would really fill you up  One issue  though  the gyro I got was kinda cold  It felt like the pork wasnt straight out the grill and actually has been cooked a couple of hours before The place was pretty quiet  wenth there on a Saturday around 2pm  Its worth a try if you are in the area and want a filling lunch ,positive,2117426
We had seen Heart Attack Grill on several shows  so we decided we would finally try it after many years of visiting Vegas  I would give the ambience 4 stars and the food 3 5 stars   The walking in and having to put on a gown and agree to certain conditions was hilarious  The entire atmosphere is over the top and fun  Definitely not for the faint of heart or health conscious that doesnt have a sense of humor  The food is solid  I had a single bypass with bacon  I wasnt trying to go too big because I wasnt in a spanking mood  Lol My wife had the hot dog with bacon  Both meals were really good  better than I thought it would be  A lot of times the restaurants that are experience heavy have less than stellar food  This wasnt the case with the Heart Attack Grill  both the experience and the food were excellent ,positive,6025837
O M G  five stars for the milk shake!!!!!!! get them!!!three stars for everything else  the farm burger i got was very salty that i couldnt finish  fries were burnt    good thing i am a fan otherwise i might get tired of seeing his face everywhere in the restaurant? loli doubt ill go back again though    but overall an OK experience!,positive,3969184

Ive been on a roll with trying new Greek/Mediterranean food places because for some reason I am always craving it  This place was reaaaally good  Its a little hidden  but a good find  I had the falafel wrap with rice  Out of all the Greek places Ive been they probably had the best tasting falafel  It was fried to perfection and was still soft and flavorful  not over fried and hard  The only thing I didnt like in my wrap was that they put a lot of parsley  but thats a preference  Next time I know to order without it bc they used too much for my taste I was also able to try their hummus and chicken  The hummus was so good and the chicken kebab was so juicy! They also have a selection of Louisiana hot sauces out  I thought the garlic hot sauce was actually good with the Greek food  Im Ill be back!,positive,3011612
GREAT place    Awesome authentic food   Perfect music    Great staffI was really happy with the service  I was really amazed with other people giving less stars!! Maybe the manager is changed now or else  I had kabob barg and it was perfect   My husband had qeyme and it was delicious    I loved the more senior guests taking precedence and starting out dancing so the younger ones (who are usually more preservative specially if persian ;)) could feel more comfortable joining     It definitely deserves more crowd,positive,1314420
Tommy came out to our house today and replace the rollers and change out the springs  really great job  This guy definitely knew what he was doing from the moment he showed up  He mentioned that we might want to replace your opener down the line  The torsion springs work beautifully and the door lifts again     Bottom line is this  if you need to use a garage door company you need to choose a one garage door service!,positive,5689743
The toaster oven was not working  the Italian bread was not available  The wheat bread was available  but was stale  I did not enjoy my steak and cheese sandwich  The customer service was minimal at best  I never expect great customer service at that location but the quality is usually good  not the case today  Neighter customer service was very good and the sandwich was not fresh ,negative,5034452

I will definitely frequent here often ,positive,1981063

I do not know whats the hype here   The place is packed at about 10am on a Saturday morning    Sat down  ordered coffee and peameal eggs benedict   Coffee came  it was mediocore  but it was OK   my intention is to try out the eggs benedict  It finally came  it looks not bad with home fries  however when I cut the first one  the egg was fully cooked!! The other one is 80% cooked   no runny egg yolk!  The hollandaise sauce was alright   not the best but not the worst   Homefries was bland!  Anyway will not return for sure   I dont know why there are so many people here Service was not bad though ,negative,2008914
I was so happy that they opened a Del Taco by my home   I was soooo disapointed!!  I have been a total of 6 times   I have never waited less than 20 minutes in the drive thru   I always get chicken soft tacos (my Favorite)  They put half the chicken in the taco that the Del Taco on Durango and Farm puts in   They only put a light sprinkle of cheese   Some of my tacos only had 3 small pieces of chicken in them    I will NEVER go back ,negative,2765406
If youre back for a second visit  please get your tastebuds checked  I was so disappointed in this place  Youd think a hole ina wall southern style breakfast place would be amazing  right? Great prices    thats about it  Eh ,negative,3153175
I dont live in Phoenix area  I was at the Phoenix Childrens Hospital with my son  We didnt really care for the cafeteria food there and we decided we wanted to order for delivery if that was possible  I called this establishment and they were so nice over the phone and were absolutely willing to deliver to the hospital  I ordered two orders of the barbecue spareribs and I ordered two rice bowls  I got three eggrolls one was for free with their coupon  I would have to say theyre very nice over The phone and very accommodating to my needs  The food arrived and it was amazing! The egg rolls were delicious the spareribs were great! I would definitely advise eating here ,positive,2024940

Ive been to this place twice and I was satisfied both times! The sushis are prepared by the chef and evry pieces were fresh  It is not pricey at all  During lunch time  they have a lunch menu combo  I chose the 11 pieces and it cost me about 7$ which is really not bad!! The place is small  they have few tables but they keep it really clean! I would definitely return to this place and have more of those delicious sushis! Give it a try:),positive,3029588

Signed up to Yelp just to comment about how horrible a service they provide   I wish I had looked at yelp before ever using them  they totally deserve their aggregate terrible rating   Was getting my fridge fixed as the the hinges were causing the fridge to not close properly   They came out and quoted $750 to replace everything and the price was high because two techs were needed    When the ONE service guy actually came to fix it they put in a new gasket and some other parts  but the hinge problem was still there   So i called their warranty service and when they came out  they said everything was fine   Because everything was fine  they charged me another $60   When I complained again to the customer service manager  they said they would send the outstanding $60 to collections if I didnt pay immediately ,negative,4444091

This is my new fav place! It is definitely a hole in the wall  The menu is a little hard to decipher because it just has the basic item and prices  There are no descriptions or information about what comes on/with each option  The tacos are wonderful! I love the fresh tortillas  I was a little surprised that they only had onions and cilantro on them  I think some guacamole or cheese might make them better  but maybe that is purely an American thing  There is plenty of room and big tables in the dining area    Not the fanciest  but functional  There are a couple of TVs  but they have been on the Spanish channel every time Ive gone in  They charge $ 50 for credit transactions  There is a sign on the door that is all in Spanish  so Im not exactly sure what it says  but I think that it is indicating that your car may be towed if you park in the spots designated for the business to the right of Sahuaro Tacos  There is additional parking behind the restaurant ,positive,5290056

Not one of my favorite sushi spots in Phoenix  but not bad Its a trendy spot so getting a table may take a little while  The sushi is above average  but the price tag has the builtin trendiness fee that will sting you when the bill comes  Service is on and off but it seems like that could just be a product of the total lack of organization that is a result of the layout  There is some free seating and people seem to haphazardly move tables around unchecked outside  Point is  the service isnt the most reliable  All in all  not bad  just not great ,neutral,3937298
The owner of the place is kind of a dick but the ice cream was delicious  I really liked the ice cream and the service of one of the two workers there was fantastic  I brought my service dog there (forgot her vest at home) and he said she cannot be in there without a vest  I was holding my dog so I dont see what health concern she was  Its not a big deal but I just felt like it wasnt a big deal for me holding my small dog while I order ice cream really quick  I understand that pets are not allowed in restaurants but it seemed like he questioned my dogs legitimacy of being a service animal  I have severe health issues and need my dog at all times  I liked the ice cream but I wont be returning because of this incident  Also  it kind of sucks how they do not have water for free there ,negative,4950866
I scheduled a ride the afternoon before my flight   The time for pickup arrived and no cab   When I called the company they said they had no record of the booking   I actually talked to the dispatcher a couple of times trying to get good directions to my location   The only good thing I can say is the morning dispatcher did give me 2 numbers for companies closer to my location ,negative,2588470

I came here for take out at around 630pm  and I was told they would call me to pick it up  so I waited outside because the restaurant was packed and also there were people waiting for tables  well I waited for 20 minutes and finally got my takeout but the waitress did not call me  I had to go in to pick it up  which I thought I should have come earlier to get my order  Anyways  other than the waiting  I would say the foods were great  popcorn chicken was juicy and crispy (if only it wasnt a take out  because it get soften once it sit inside the box for a while) :(  and I have also ordered the fried squid ball that comes in 12 pieces  smart idea of cutting each balls in half to make it look like theres a lot with only 4 99! lol   but I would definitely come back but next time I would consider coming earlier and try get a table  I rated a 4 stars ,positive,3149323

I have been to every selfserve froyo place in the east valley except this one  Well   I finally went due to my usual place having broken machines when I was trying to get my fix  Let me just say that Zoyo has the best flavors and the most original flavors  I got the Raspberry Pomegranate Tart and their Chocolate  I tried flavors such as Watermelon Sorbet  Aloha  and Salted Caramel  All were delicious and I cant wait to go back for more  The pricing is average I think  45/oz and they have all the toppings you might expect  Actually the only topping I wish they had but they didnt was fruity pebbles or fruit loops  Anyway  this is my new favorite froyo spot and even better that it is a little closer to my home  Break away from your usually froyo spot and give them a try  BTW   Dunkin Donuts is right next door     :),positive,2228222
This literally used to be my favorite restaurant  The food is amazing and the atmosphere is great   Janelle is literally the best waitress they have! Until I went there for my birthday and they were extremely rude from the time I made the reservation till time I left ! We had a party of 12   and only 6 of us was on time   and they kept telling us how they cant sit us down until the rest of the party comes ! Then I ALWAYS order the kimchi fries with the kimchi on the side (as you can see in the picture) but for some reason they were making a big deal about it   even making the manager come to the table to explain why they cant simply but the kimichi on the side which I was still paying for ! So instead of bringing the kimichi on the side with they brought my fries completly plain with nothing on it   when it usually comes with bougli and 2 different types of sauces !,negative,5365429
Horrible experience   We went to dinner on March 4 with my Family and Special needs son and it started off fine the drinks came out the appetizer came out   BUT when it came time for the meals thats when it started    Everyone was served their food Except my 12 year old son  The waitress went and served my sons burger to another table  then instead of letting us know she just ignored our table  not  till I got up out of my seat and said where is my sons food everyone is over half way done with their meals and hes had nothing  they just said Were sorry it was a mistake   A mistake is fine BUT WHERE THE COMMUNICATION   I just ended up saying just bag my food up so I can leave    Then to top it off ALL THEY DID WAS COMP THE  WRONG MEAL AND CHARGED ME FOR KIDS MEALS ON A NIGHT WHEN THEY WERE SUPPOSED TO BE FREE   and when I called to speak to the Manager the girl kept telling hes busy or hes in a meeting  Over horrible experience  ,negative,1769896
Surrender is pretty tight    the light show they have outside is awesome    the gogo dancers are hot and the dj was great the night i went     only problem was the 16 dollar drinks and 8 dollar waters    welcome to vegas i guesschampagne was free for girls that night   was able to get in without waiting in line by being a guest at the wynn  still had to pay cover tho   ,positive,4660938
Nice atmosphere   smaller dinning room towards the front  huge double bar in the rear   large draft selection  i tried a local pilsner that was perfect temp and tasty   For lunch I opted for a pizza the margarita was a little surprised that it didnt have fresh slices of mozz like Im use to but the crust was super thin chewy but crisp on the edges   my mother in law chose the burger it was nice size and the meat was super fresh  the frites where hand cut and fried to perfection   over enjoyed the food pizza and burger prices where normal   but could see some other items much higher!,positive,3875259
i bought some furniture from Mor  I would not do it again! When you walk in the door  they assign a person to shadow you  and prompt you throughout the time your there  I went in looking for ideas and new furniture  I told the staff I just wanted to browse  I then heard one of the supervisors prompting the salesman to follow me and help me   I dont think this place is conducive for shopping  but probably good if your looking for Espresso colored fake wood mixed with micro fiber material  It all look the same  ,negative,6588958
I was unhappy due to having to wait 55 minutes for my one meal (steamed veggies combo with chicken  shrimp and scallops!  Then I get two pieces of shrimp  three small slices of chicken a few tiny scallops!!  For $12 00 that is a rip off  a joke and unacceptable!  You going to charge for food with those items in you better put more than sliced veggies!!  I will never come back!,negative,2775796
Went to get some Sushi before heading out to a show  I was very underwhelmed with Shibuya  The server was very nice and spoke to us about the menu but everything he recommended was subpar  For the rolls we ordered they were between 2836 00 and I was just expecting much more  The most expensive one had Australian lobster and it was by far the worst one  very dry  I would skip this and spend your money at Nobu instead ,negative,6281493
We came here on a mission  To find the perfect pizza  Yes its the infamous Quest for perfect pizza UYE  Turnout was great This place serves Neapolitan pizza  Its not your basic pizza  You wont find your basic toppings like pepperoni or chicken BBQ or meat lover   etc They take authenticity very seriously  If I had to describe this chain in one word it would be strict  Pizza comes in one size and one size only  12 inch  Apparently its illegal to serve any other size  They got plenty of strict rules regarding their toppings too  Crust is very thin  resembles naan  Toppings are fresh  Overall tasty pizza  slightly pricy for 12 inch Such cultured  much authentic  very enriched  wow! Surely worth trying out ,neutral,5968835
Thank goodness for yelpers leading me to this hole in the wall  The reviews were right on  It was an authentic Korean joint with traditional rice/meat dishes  No ji gaes or pan chans   Its Korean fast food at its finest  The restaurant is small  but there is seating available  The big added bonus was the free hot sake after 6 pm  I got the spicy squid rice bowl  Couldve been a little less spicy  I enjoyed it overall  The service is great  The options are varied enough  and the prices are good!,positive,4708118
Ever since the new owner took over I could not be happier!

I just want to say that for the past 2 weeks me and my husband have been dealing with Ali Wahali and he is the most patient sales guy ever  I call him at least 10 times this week  sent numerous emails  and everytime he had the answers to all the questions i asked and was never annoyed  Thank you for such a non pressured experience  I didnt fell rushed at all  all in all a really personable guy The other thing that me and my husband decided we liked about the price was the No haggle  One price  we knew they were being honest and not trying to over charge us  Before purchasing my car i felt like i did enough research  On auto nations web site  the Toyota Camry i wanted  in the specific color was only price differenced by the miles on the vehicle  I can honestly say i love that my car and I had an awesome experience ,positive,2334224
Eh  I called for a design appt and was given the run around  We visited instead and each salesperson gave us a different response to how items would grow  what their roots were like etc  The moment we mentioned we had a landscaper that did our hardscape but werent sure if we wanted to use him for landscaping  they basically wrote us off   Since leaving here weve visited other nurseries with MUCH better pricing and service  My recommendation is browse here and buy elsewhere ,negative,977255

CVS auto signs up for ready refills without permission and fills them when specifically told customer will call when ready for refill as they can be expensive  Wants you to create online account then tells you you cannot cancel auto refills they have set up without permission but you must go in person to cancel the auto refill    when medicine is expensive this is terrible to do  When fed up with account you cannot cancel the online account   they want to keep all private information and will not allow canceling online ,negative,623465
Wow  I must be invisible today  I walk in   wait to be seated behind two folks  Two people came behind me with a chilld  They seat  the two folks in front of me  then they seat two folks that came in after me with the child     and leave me standing there   Never again ,negative,6475306
Ive been to this Savers twice now  The first time I came in search for an ugly holiday sweater for work  While there were plenty of ugly sweaters  they werent exactly what I was looking for  Instead  I opted to make my own and purchased two red sweaters (one for me and one for my husband) for under $6  This was a great find and price! I feel like all the clothing is decently priced and they have a good selection  I also like how it is organized by shirt type  which is really helpful! On my most recent trip  I needed a checkered/flannel type shirt for an upcoming event  Again  there were plenty to choose from! I finally found one by Guess for $8  Another great find! I definitely like this Savers over other Goodwills (and the like) Ive been to  It is much bigger (with more items) and seems cleaner  Ill definitely be back ,positive,3027346
I would give this restaurent 2 stars as the main issue is that the food was warm  It appeared that the food was already prepared earlier in the day and sitting on a heated tray  It was a surprise that my food arrived within 2 minutes      not even enough time to finish half a bun from a basket of bread that was provided  I would rate this food comparable to what we call an Italian bakery with a hot table! Serving hot freshly prepared food is what I would expect from an Italian restaurant ,negative,2867037
Living in the SGV  I wasnt really expecting AMAZING pho here in Vegas  let alone even get pho here  But since we all had a crazy night and the weather was cold and rainy  pho seemed like a perfect thing to have at the time  We came here and the place was kinda small  Id say like 3040 ppl could sit in there to eat  We had a part of 12 and the staff there was super friendly  I ended up just getting the basic Pho Dat Biet and even though Ive had it so many times at home it was still good because of the weather  I would say that if I came again and it was rainy weather too and the night before was filled with booze again lol I would definitely come back here  Not too amazing but still good nonetheless ,neutral,3442102

I dont care about the wait time as long as you keep up with those weekend specials! If you expect to be in your car 10 minutes after you arrive  dont come here  But the staff is friendly and the deals can be great  I have had great service except for one bald guy who works there  He treated me as if I was a moron because I am youngish  Didnt have the heart to tell him that I am a biology PhD student and have rented cars many times for research  Worst customer service rep I have encountered in a while  Enterprise  you can find someone better to replace him with  Otherwise  I dig this place!,neutral,2010926

We came for Breakfast  The staff was attentive and very engaging  We ordered the suggested or top meals  Steak and Eggs  in addition to Eggs Benedict  Keeping in mind that we were in Vegas  we felt it to be appropriate to also get some adult beverages! We decided on the Bellini and Mimosa  Both were made to perfection  as was our breakfast  For three people we got 3 meals  and 2 rounds of drinks  Total came to $175 00  so although it was good  make sure you all bring your wallets!Would definitely recommend and go back  Worth every penny ,positive,5961175

Weve been here over a year  Weve truly enjoyed our time here and the staff is fantastic  Weve dealt with Anna  Nathan and Roger  My only reason for 4 stars is during our summer here we were without ac for 3 weeks total in one month  It was a complete mess and was really hard on us financially as we had to stay with family or get a hotel room  Roger even came in on his days off and on a holiday to assist with the terrible situation  Im very nervous for this summer but hoping everything will work properly  We put out almost $800 out of pocket for hotel rooms  Otherwise  weve loved the quiet area  concierge services and all of the staffs friendly and welcoming demeanor ,positive,6183740

When they gave me the prices on the eyeglass lenses  I told them I wanted to go home and think about it  I expected some resistance on their part  but instead they said that it would not be a problem  So I found the sales staff to be very courteous and professional  And the Optometrist  Michelle Wong  was completely delightful  I highly recommend her!!,positive,6360780

Dd I really miss a review of PublicUs? Well allow me to fix that right here  right now  with a 5* review So I knew about PublicUs for about a year before I finally tried them out  Theyre not exactly in the most convenient location  but the coffee more than makes up for their location  Its simply the best coffee Ive had in Las Vegas  and is a top contender for a top 10 favorite coffee in the world The prices do match the quality  but thats the only downfall I can find  Staff is friendly and more than help me concoct a coffee beverage thats right for me  Lately Ive been getting an Americano with a bit of steamed milk  So good  I dont even need to add sugar Did I mention how nice the staff are here?,positive,819789
First time trying out this place  The customer service is great but the wait is very very long  The food is good but the price is a little pricey  I wanted to try ordering other things but the guy gave me a heads up that it would be 30 minutes wait or more  it was no joke it was a long wait  So if youre really craving for Jefes then go ahead  if youre just hungry in a hurry this is not the place because the wait is long ,neutral,1174880
Im surprised at the negative reviews  Every time I come they are very professional and do an excellent job  Ive been getting fillins and pedicures for over 30 years and Kenny is in my top 10 of nail techs  Top tech in Charlotte  Robin gives fantastic pedicures  You can tell they take pride in their work   They are very busy and I make appointments but do see them accept walkins all the time ,positive,2956702
What a great experience   Having never been to a cinema that served drinks as well as had pre selected seats  it really was a great place for a night out   Buying the tickets online was so easy  the staff were helpful and the lines short   Beers were well priced and my girlfriend said her hot chocolate was delicious   I really recommend this place if you want to watch a new release in comfortable seats  cheaply and easily accessible ,positive,6306404
Gotta love a remodel! Tyber Creek was due for a little love and they did a really great job  Beyond the nicely put together two floors  spacious bars and plenty of seating  Tyber offers a really sweet patio  Whether you care to enjoy a Guinness after work or are itching to play some cornhole  this is a perfect place to do so  Bartenders are friendly and the overall vibe is relaxed and easy  Bonus points for great daily drink specials! As for the eats  the menu also received a fairly nice redo as well! I was particularly fond of the pesto dip to go along with the fresh and toasty pita triangles  While the spicy cheese sticks sounded scrumptious  I kept hoping that my next bite would be spicier  That just gives me more of a reason to come back and try a few more apps!,positive,1404255
I asked for the dressing on the side so my salad wouldnt get soggy however when I got home it was already soggy  Its way too expensive for what you get  I paid extra for meat and they gave me a few tiny pieces of chicken    The salads are already expensive plus if you want some protein you have to pay like $3 00  Its totally not worth it  If you want a good salad I suggest order from a restaurants and pick it up if you want it to go ,negative,1891374

Came here based on Yelp recommendation  Its basically a little hole in the wall establishment  Pretty stark ambiance  Paper plates  Nor a huge variety of beverages BUT the food was hot and delicious  Large portions all well seasoned  Im not a fan of gyro meat because I dont like lamb  The owner gave me a sample of her gyro meat and it was really good   I dont live in the area  but I would definitely come here when I am in the area  The service was really good  Very personable ,positive,643317
The restaurant is owned and operated by a family from New Jersey   There were no other customers on the Thursday evening of our visit  no doubt attributable to its location in a commercial section of town  though there were a few takeout orders   We started off with fried mermaids   shrimp  ham and scallions wrapped in rice paper that have been deep fried and served with a sweet and sour sauce   Our shared entrees were spicy eggplant with chicken and pad se ew with shrimp   Each dish was prepared with fresh ingredients  visually appealing and delicious,positive,4982247
Bad service  I am new to the area and am looking for a good bakery to by regularly from  I show up the at 5:58 this evening to buy a cake and some croissants  The door was open and there were two ladies inside  The store was set to close at 6:00  I walk into the store and they tell me their closed and refuse giving me service  I will not be going back  Felt pretty shitty ,negative,439131
For a Monday night it was pretty busy  The waiters and bus boys were prompt and friendly  I was told to get the Chicken Fajitas so I did The salsas that they bring out first were amazing  I loved it! The green salsa was pretty baller  When the fajitas came out I was excited but when I started digging into them I tasted oil and butter  Im not a huge fan of buttery veggies and chicken  My taste buds arent quite up to that  The flower tortillas werent exactly my favorite either  Too cakey  Overall the chips and salsa that were brought out were the best thing for me  The rest  well lets say for a chubby man that never leaves food on his plate there was plenty left when I left  I recommend swinging in for the salsas and if you like buttered down veggies ,neutral,1247509
I was disappointed when I got home to find one item missing that I paid for  I ordered 3 loaded potato grilled but received 2  I got the rest of my order just fine  It just sucks when you spend the last of your cash and dont get what you pay for Order #368569,negative,2714225
My first time here we left because we were unable to find a seat at the bar  This time around however we snagged the last 2 seats at the front bar and had a good time  it became standing room only shortly after  Both bars were open tonight (Saturday)  (unlike when we came on a Sunday before)  The bartenders were attentive  when we first sat down 3 different ones asked if we were ready to order  Each time we said we werent  but none of them offered to make a suggestion of what to order  After we eventually did order as soon as the glasses got low various bar tenders stopped by to offer a refill  Rather attentive for being so busy  A popular spot on the street so Im glad I can finally say Ive been here ,positive,3723755

Oh goodness  where to start? My great uncle took my family there our first night in Toronto  The first course was soup  which was really good went back for second  The second was    Beijing Kao Ya! Or  known to westerners as Peking Duck  They even brought it out and cut it in front of us  It looks so juicy and definitely did not disappoint  both with the crepesskinonionhoisin sauce  and the accompanying sauteed duck with lettuce wrap  I dont remember much of the other dishes  other that they were good  There was another one mushroom and bokchoy soooo good! I kept going back and back and was really sad that it was gone  Overall  very splendid  You should go with a larger group in order to  well  order more dishes ,positive,3992726

Its been about a little over 3 years since ive been here  so i will only base my rating on the experiences i had here then I moved to AZ when I graduated from highschool and made friends with a bunch of other non arizonians and we came here probably 3 times a week for happy hour  I was only 18 and the rest of my crew were of age  I had never had sushi before so this place was a little intimitating at first  but once i started to try it  i enjoyed it very much so  (Now that im more of a sushi expert  i can say their sushi wasnt great  but good for beginners ) I can still say (at least 3 years ago) that they have the best calamari ive ever had  This place  at the time  had a great atmosphere and saki bombs were okay to do here    It may have just been the company i was with  but i greatly enjoyed coming to this place and sneaking saki bombs and shots :)next time i go back to AZ to visit  this place is a must,positive,3286058
Love this place    So many great choices to choose from   I love both their tapsilog and their adobo omelets   (Watch out for the bay leaves  though  if you order the adobo omelet )  This place is open late and is a great place to stop by after the clubs ,positive,3534362

This is a great place for dessert! Its fluffy  flavorful and the prices for the sizes that they have is extremely reasonable I ordered a small Crunchy Cookie & I absolutely loved it! Ive had other types of Snow Ice desserts but I think this is definitely my new favorite place  The flavors definitely come out exactly how you expect and its not watered down like some of the places Ive been to!The main problem I could see here is the limited seating as well as the busy parking area ,positive,5217329
Best veggie burgers ever!  I swear they must put crack in those things  Im a total addict!  Ill go back a couple times a week for more   and Im not a vegetarian!

Told me my bill was going to be $600 plus dollars and had no idea if he could do it and would call me  No thanks  I called Ben Franklin  did it for the normal price of 389 plus the emergency trip charge  he was there in an hour an gone in another hour  Avoid Brazil like the plague   ,negative,2619659
My coworker and I have been traveling to the Scottsdale area for over 6 months now and this is easily one of our favorite places  The food is great and we really enjoy the atmosphere  The Iive music on Wednesdays is some of the best we have seen but we usually spend our Monday nights at The Montauk  There is a bar tender named Shanna that takes care of us and she is outstanding  From food and drink recommendations to high quality service  you cant go wrong on a Monday night with her ,positive,3671544
Went here looking to get a new King Mattress & new exactly what price we wanted & were helped right away! This meant a lot to us since we are younger that normally discourages people from helping us! The older gentleman was so nice  helpful  & professional! We were only in there maybe 25 minutes before we fell in love with the nicest bed & it was so cheap! Thankfully we have a truck & waited another 510 to load it up (I would suggest bringing your own tie downs theres did give out on the way back) & had it that day! Would highly recommend them to anyone for any home decor or appliances!,positive,6238456

I was so relieved to find Camelback Moving on Yelp after running into a few dead ends with movers that were recommended by friends  I was nervous as this was the first time I had to hire movers  but it turned out to be a great experience The two movers were fast  efficient  and professional  I felt so bad for them because it was 102 and 80% humidity that day! They were able to move items out of my old house in Mesa to our new place in Gilbert (a 2 story) plus pick up two pieces of furniture at two other houses in less than four hours I deducted one star because there was a glitch in my paperwork (wrong hourly rate) and also due to the piece of stucco near our front door that was damaged during the move  Nothing so big that would prevent me from using them or recommending them again ,positive,2766758

The hotel lobby is gorgeous with giant chandeliers  It was nice having the Eiffel Tower as a beacon of where to head in the wee hours of the morning when we were stumbling home ;) Sure there are even more beautiful and luxurious hotels on the strip  but for the price and the fun we had while at the hotel I thoroughly enjoyed it ,positive,3806288
Very cool setting  Everything on the Sunday brunch buffet was so flavorful without being over the top! And cheap mimosas too,positive,5806180
This place is really  really fun!  There is stuff going on all around you  The service was good even though we had almost 20 people in our group  We had a hot dog  slider and soft pretzel from the happy hour menu (goes until 7 which is nice) and it was all delicious and fresh  I heard the wings were especially good too  We will definitely be coming back ,positive,5504605
Poor service  Dirty  Good donuts Service is very poor here  the staff serves you but not friendly  On one trip through the drive thru we received one wrong donut   After driving home and realizing the donut my child wanted was missing I went back to request the correct one   The cashier said where is your receipt and charged me for another donut like I was going to waste my time and drive back here to scam one free donut! I stopped frequenting this place anyway because it is frequently very dirty  Only reason to give this store any stars is the donuts are very good ,negative,4223731
Excellent food  excellent service! They should however  make their own macaroni salads & potato salads  I will definitely come back They sell amazing cookies!  The Bee Thrasher sandwich was excellent ,positive,1041081
Relaxed business  employees are pretty chill  Tom helped me out and gave me some good information and answers to my questions  Gave me some recommendations about replacing my tires but didnt push it on me  The main waiting room is open  well air conditioned  music overhead wasnt too loud or annoying  Chairs were comfortable enough to sit in for an hour or so ,positive,4333150
For a small fee of $7 per car you can experience the beauty of Red Rock Canyon  Their visitors center was pretty big with an outdoor look out that had lots of facts on the wildlife &  plants in the area  Inside theres a fun little photo booth  gift shop  & taxidermy/statues of wild animals  On to nature:A short drive from the visitors center are a couple of hikes  Lots of rock climbers out there as well! A little further down & theres more hiking  look outs  & also a lovely outdoor picnic area where our group shared a yummy bento box lunch at  Id definitely come back to do more hiking & picnicking  Loved it there!,positive,1250561
The music venue is delightful  if loud   The menu is somewhat limited  but prepared quite well   However  the prices for wine and beer are outrageous (half of glass of wine  $7 50)  We were quite surprised when we received our bill of fare   Moreover  to add to the insulting price  they purchase wine from a local winery  Kokopelli and its pretty bad (particularly acidic)   Benevilla boasts that Birts is here to help those in need platebyplatemethinks its more glassbyglass and that is unfortunately price gouging   For this reason alone  we will not return   And we would suggest they consider becoming a byob place instead of having a continuing connection with Kokopelli ,negative,4932726
I love this place since you can buy a whole lot of food for like $35   And they actually check your togo orders every time so you dont have to wonder why youre missing a sauce or what not I think that its actually great in this sense since I know a couple places that consistently screw up togo orders So to the togo crew?  You guys rock it out for this national chain   Which is saying something since its like giving 4stars to McDonalds  :)  Oh wait    have I done that? hmmmmm    ,positive,2435711
Bakn is pretty darn good! I have been there a few times now  and each time Ive loved what I ordered  The brunch cocktails Ive had have all been good  and fairly strong (yay)  Service has always been very solid as well  When I went with my mom and aunt  who are notorious for always splitting things wherever we go  they actually brought out each half on separate plates which I thought was sweet of them  It may not seem like a big thing  but it was nice and we appreciated it!My one issue is that its kind of expensive for what it is  I think they are going for the upscale brunch vibe  but the prices are even higher than some of my favorite brunch spots downtown  Its definitely good  and if Im in the area I would continue to stop by for brunch!,positive,441078
This is pretty average mexican food  The service was quick and the people working there were nice  The guacamole has no taste  It was the worst Ive ever had  The burrito I got was ok  The portions are big  I dont think Ill be back as there must be better mexican food shops out there that are better ,neutral,5318872
Honestly best hole on the wall place in Las Vegas  Not expensive at all  A little wait since the place is always packed  The Tonkotsu Shoyu Ramen to die for! The broth is rightly season and the pork belly?! Orgasmic! $6 95 fo those noodles? Better than going to Asian Town in LA ,positive,1757297
Br Badalamenti is the best dentist I have met  He is so cheerfull and makes you feel very confortable during your procedures  His staff is so nice and warm and always so happy to help  Darlene and Matt are the best  They really made my whole procedure smooth and painless  Great office and great people ,positive,589097
great hideaway place  First time there  Will be going back ,positive,6579991
I had a Cheat Day wrap from here the other day and it was really good   Nice blend of ingredients  perfect temperature (even though delivery)  and just enough   The whole wheat tortillas are delicious  My friend placed the order online  our meal arrived slightly later than expected  and we received a duplicate entree not ordered  However  the food was really good  which is what matters most right?,positive,2104514
Okay  after barfing all over my shirt following the Yelp event (I drank WAY to much!) I decided that mama needed a new shirt  Im always impressed how service is just all over the place here  Sometimes it friendly and attentive while other times its some punk with his pants below his ass  Why do punk kids where their pants like that? Is it for easy access to their back door? Yuck!Today  good service and great selection! Moma didnt find a shirt tho I can never leave here without getting a few new pairs of CK undies off the clearance table  Yes  I shop clearance and am proud of it!!,positive,4025638
We went in quite late on a quite night  the server seemed distant to our table  my friends really enjoyed the steak  my chipotle chicken was tasty but dry  It took our server forever to bring our drinks  never bothered to come around ask for refills  I had to walk to the bar to order a second drink whilst our server was chatting to a table right next to us!! I will not visit this place again,negative,6142523
NEVER AGAIN   If i could give this company negative stars I would   Horrible customer service and attitude on the phone   They bait and switched me with their prices  saying one thing during online reservations and then making me pay extra at the counter NEVER AGAIN   I will never again book with Fox or any of its affiliates   I hope that extra fee they charged was worth a lifetime of sales from me and my family and friends who wont be using Fox after they hear about it from me I will be informing BBB about this because last time i looked bait and switch was ILLEGAL ,negative,3842903
Im a really big fan of this little cafe! Enricos is hidden in the Strip District  All the food is so authentic  and you can tell its made very fresh  I give the restaurant four stars instead of five ONLY because the menu is a little bit limited and because Enricos is very small  so its sometimes hard to get seated  I could eat their pasta and pizza everyday  so I really recommend you give it a try if youre in the Strip ,positive,2903967
These guys consistently do a really good job  the sushi is not too expensive and always good quality  It seems that there are less sushi restaurants that actually have staff who are familiar with the traditional sushi options and not just all americanized rolls  I really like a good chirashi bowl and the sushi chef at sakana does a fantastic job with their bowls  I love their Happy Hour if you order a bomber size beer you get to choose one of a variety of apps for  99 which is a great addition to the already good sushi and value  It always seems like the best sushi spots are always tucked away in a shopping plaza that doesnt get much activity like the one that sakana is in on Indian bend ,positive,5097003
The mall is right across from our timeshare so we do come in when we are in town  but for some reason  customer service at most of the shops are lacking but hey  it is Vegas ,neutral,4922844
Stars way down  I forgot how awful the service is here and went back again today  The food is still OK but the service has probably gotten worse  The women behind the counter seemed to be asleep on their feet and said as little as possible to me ,negative,4576578
Just got a pedicure here  My technician did take quite a long time  but it was well worth it considering his attention to detail   The salon was extremely clean  There was also a decent selection of pedicures  some on the pricier side   I chose the lemon pedicure ($35) and it was very refreshing   I believe the basic pedicure was only $25 ,positive,3330234
Atmosphere was great and upbeat  service was great  got our food very fastwithin 5 or 7 minutes  Many different choices  planning another trip soon so i can try more of their hotdogs  Got the elote dog and it was delicious! 10/10 would recommend ,positive,377433
Finally found a great place in the SW Suburbs for my Pho fix  Very friendly staff that shared a couple of secrets for how they make such a great bowl as soon as they open for lunch   Have not tried any of the Chinese on the menu  so cant comment on it  but the vietnamese is as good as anywhere ,positive,1115916
Stopped at this pub for a quick dinner after spending the day being tourists  She got the short ribs with fries special and I got the Mussels in a cream sauce with fries  Short ribs  eh   not much to rave about but thats okay because everything else was great :) The mussels were sooooo good! The sauce was creamy and flavorful   we even used it as dipping sauce for the fries  Server Lisandra was attentive and patient as we couldnt decide what to eat  She made sure to come check on us and made sure she nurtured our every request  Very glad we stopped by  Great place right down the block from the Metro station  Definitely  recommend for service quickness   food quality and convenience :),positive,4598622
Delicious     and I know others agree since it is always packed but the food is worth it every time ,positive,848629
The cutest little boutique you can find  The workers are incredible and they have clothing that you wont find anywhere else ,positive,4816621
This dining experience was very good  I wouldnt say it was great  Our server had the personality of a rock  I believe you could tell him that he won a million dollars and he would just look at you and say okay  The starter breads were very good  the pizza appetizer was good  my veal chop was very good and my wifes spaghetti was good  One thing that irks me about these high end restaurants is no salt and pepper on the tables  How does the chef know what everyones palate is like? I dont get it  I dont know if I would come back  there just werent enough food options that I like  We ate at Gordon Ramsays the day before and that was awesome and definitely some place I would revisit ,positive,5180191
5 stars  for the prepared foods  B E S T  tacos we have had since moving to Ohio  Theyre like the taco carts/trucks on each corner under the 7 train along Roosevelt Ave in Queens (NYC)  DELICIOUS! Finger licking good! We regularly come to La Plaza  and it never disappoints! Weve brought many first timers here  and each time theyll text a few days later  Can you send me the name/address of that taco place? The tamales are SLAMMIN! The bakery is on point  (Disclosure  weve never had a cake from here )4 stars  for Mexican groceries  I dont cook Mexican food  so my assessment may not be accurate  But it looks like itd have every ingredient needed/wanted  We definitely pick up a few novelty groceries each time we come  4 stars  for the produce  the variety is fresh and varied  but limited  I can pick up specific items but have never been able to only shop here for all my weeks produce needs  When I buy produce here  its only as a supplement for specific dishes ,positive,60281
Good food a great people     I truly love this place  My food is always fresh  hot  and seasoned well  Definitely a must try for Soul food!!!  Im a huge fan of the fish  shrimp  mac n cheese  fried okra  and the Ox Tails (yessuh)!,positive,1351963
Im normally not a bagel fan but this place was recommended by a friend so we decided to make stop when we stopped by Mile End   Its a cute little shop in the middle of a street and if you dont look hard enough you may miss it   The sign is not very eyecatching   However  just look for the people When we passed the place the first time  the line was long   When we came back the second time  there were less people and then we realized because the place was small so people had to wait outside   We ordered a sesame bagel and a garlic bagel   The service was very fast  there were a lot of people working behind the counter (they accommodated for their popularity) The bagels definitely tasted different from the the New York style bagel here   The bagels were less chewy and I actually did enjoy it ,positive,2929490
Ive gotten wings  both spicy and garlic  a few times  Wings are fried hard which I like  To go service is quick and convenient  My only complaint is that they are a little over priced  10 wings for $12 and 20 for $23 ,positive,3047507
Dying battery  9:45 pm  store closes at 10  They took their time  discussed our options  Waited patiently while we made our decision   Then installed the battery and told us to relax in the air conditioning   Battery was expensive  but that is anywhere  Nothing we can do about that  Other stores were closed  Too bad for them  Thanks guys at Auto Zone you rock ,positive,963290
Im just happy to find Superman ice cream!  Now I dont have to go back to Michigan for anything except corned beef sandwiches!,positive,2926343
The food here is always good classic Sonoran fair with a little bit more heat using the New Mexico Hatch chilis then standard Sonora style restaurants in the valley  The rice and beans are pretty classic there are no surprises and no disappointments the service is about the same  nothing great but not disappointing either and prices are reasonable ,neutral,4843271
Vegas local  Hard to find at first  but walk around until you get a 21 coupon  and ask them where it is  Apparently its been around for awhile  Kick ass drinks  Dont bother with the cocktail waitresses  Go straight to the bar  If Johns there youre in luck! So great  Cant wait to see him at Liquid (Arias pool club),positive,5794543
Went here with a group from the office  Everyone really enjoyed the food  I had the chicken salad sandwich  it was out of this world  The staff could not have been more friendly  The only draw back I can see is its a bit hard to find  its inside an office building  and theres no signage  I highly recommend this place for lunch  cant wait to try some of the items on the breakfast menu ,positive,6245103
I paid nearly  $14 for breakfast that was very underwhelming  sure I had orange juice as well but 14 bucks? It came with 2 eggs  a small portion of home fries  some not so appealing looking sausages  toast and fruit  In my opinion the portions are small and the price not justified ,negative,2519565
We were invited out to dinner with our neighbors who happened to have a couple coupons  The coupons were buy one meal get the second free  Apparently we could not use the two coupons at the same table  The coupon said subject to rules of use  My question is: What are the rules? Were we suppose to sit at separate tables? So to wrap it up  Vivo you lost four customers  you were wrong about the coupon offer  and quit being Coupon Nazis ,negative,6164247
One of the best nature burgers money can buy  and they have olives as free toppings!The onion rings seem to have changed  chipped bits of onions battered vs a ring so they dont get as crispy on the outside  fries were great My boyfriend enjoyed his home burger as well Much better than hero burger  wish there were more locations ,positive,4074140
7 tortellini for $17 dollars  Ok  so this might fly in Arizona but in Vegas welcome to true culinary competition! My main course didnt fill me up at a petite barely over 5ft! No bread with tortellini pasta either? Manager explained that is by request only! Thats not Vegas! You need to conform to foodie culinary ways of Vegas! Give this manager ability to be successful! Allow your service professionals to ask guests if they want bread so this restaurant can be successful! Its busy but from the people at the bar its ok     make it amazing and give decent portions and offer bread! Let the manager perform magic! He appears extremely customer centered and amazing! Listen to his requests!,neutral,65672
My family and I LOVE donuts  Our standards are high and this place was pretty good  Bad thing is  we are in a hurry and just asked for an assortment of donuts  But the filing donuts were definitely a treat Cons:  some donuts were a little dry Will try again ,positive,3688066
This is the second time I have used Desert Valley Roofing   They did the roof on my residence 1 and 1/2 years ago   I now had them repair the roof on my rental home   Again  I could not ask for a more satisfactory experience   From dealing with Ashley in their office  to Victor who did the inspection and produced the proposal  to the efficiency of the crew run by Jose perfect job once again   Their pricing is more than fair  and they actually do exactly what they say they are going to do   Pleasure to deal with this company ,positive,5352212

Tana provides such an amazing authentic experience  The service was wonderful and the owner was so generous and hospitable  I highly recommend the chicken sambusas; they were amazing  The whole menu is vegan friendly and so delicious!,positive,4682932
After dining at Foosia  we were really really craving some dessert   So of course I took to Yelp to see what fellow Yelpers had said and we found Sweet Republic   There was no need to just get a regular scoop of ice cream when we could choose from their insanely delicious sounding sundaes! We ended up getting the Pecan Turtle after reading all about it here   But I could definitely go back for the Campfire Smores in order to have some of their housemade marshmallows   Next time for sure!,neutral,186269
I have been working out with Tracy for a little over 3 weeks now and have been seeing very good results  I am a former personal trainer myself and feels that Tracy is very good at his job and Im learning some things that I didnt even know  I am getting ready to go on vacation to Cancun with my husband and I needed someone to jump start me  I feel even personal trainers need a little push sometimes  He is very good at his job and a great motivator  If you need extra motivation and help getting started on your workout regimen hes the guy to check out  Thanks Tracy for all your help and my husband thanks you too ,positive,2238376
My husband and I had guests from out of town and we brought them here for breakfast  The food is simply amazing  Ive been to there other locations too but the one inside the Linq casino tasted a lot better  The chorizo with eggs and potatoes are sooooooo good!! If you are staying at the Linq you must check out this place! Its super good  We had reservations but it took about 40 minutes for our food to come out  They were super busy so it wasnt an issue for us  The customer service was wonderful too  Make sure you come hungry because the portions are HUGE! ),positive,3762403
We had an early dinner  So we had both happy hour and off the regular menu  Everything was delicious  Service was a little slow  And they brought the food out almost all at once  The Sashimi especially the salmon and the albacore were special  We also had hamachi collar spicy Tuna Roll and salmon skin salad  All good Hiro is better  but this works  Small intimate place  Reserve if you go on a Fri or Sat ,positive,6016875
Had been here today had the gyros the food is delicious the service was great 4 starts because the server was being yelled at by a man no idea for what but thats the way you treat a women? Cum on Learn some etiquette man ,positive,1647161
Truly horrible experience !!! They dont have a problem deceiving their customers and when it comes to the results they are unapologetic!!! I spent over $2500  for less than 40% hair reduction in one area !!! When I confronted them  I was told hair is unpredictable    be happy with the results     you have less hair than before ! I contacted the regional manager who informed me that there is nothing they can do!!! I cant say enough of how disappointed Im from this experience  :(,negative,5732929
They are having a promo of buying 1 lobster get another 1 for free   $38 for two lobsters     You can only get them in one style of cooking   It sounded good   But then the lobsters were quite small   Its probably a onepounder each   We ordered the clams with black bean sauce and some dim sum dishes to make the meal more filling ,neutral,5107365

I reallly want to rate this place higher because the food is good   However  the two times I have visited the place has been packed and the wait painfully long   On our second visit  granted this was on a Sunday at brunch time  we were seated after an hour wait and then waited another 40 minutes to get our food   While the food is good  its not so over the top or truely unique that its worth this kind of wait ,negative,2535477
Solid K bbq  Got a large beef combo for three of us  My wife ate her usual amount and my friend and I tore up the rest of it  It was more food than I shouldve eaten    but it was worth it! Checked in on Facebook and they gave us a free bottle of soju  It was my first time there so I wish they would tell me when it was ok to eat their egg jjim and corn  When the waitress said  oh you can eat that any time  my friend and I destroyed it  Yeah  we were full and happy ,positive,4539144
I would not choose to eat on the premisesbut that is entirely on me  at 72  I am more comfy hanging at the Christian Science Reading Room or Lawn Bowling So I really have little experience with wings   BUT  with BWW one can order online  choose a pickup time   And I did just that and crossed Harmon Street from the Marriott Grand Chateau for the ez pickup Hey  the wings were delicious!

MAPS MAPS MAPS MAPS MAPS MAPS MAPS MAPS MAPS!!!!!!!!!Old maps  New maps  Big maps  Small maps  Paper maps  Laminated maps  Framed maps  Globe maps  This place has all the maps  I dont think they were too happy with me when I walked in one day looking for the cheapest world map I could find (I was only going to be tearing it up for an art project)  but they totally had me hook line and sinker with the gorgeous framed maps  globes and vintage road maps they held within their walls  I will be back  Because cartography is awesome  And who doesnt want to dream about the places they can go?The staff is pretty well versed on maps  Ive never seen anyone more knowledgable  It also looks like they will make you custom maps of an area you are needing (part of a city  etc   )  Bonus is that they offer a AAA discount too  Because AAA doesnt have all the maps  Like world maps  You can only get those at a wide world of maps ,positive,3563530
Ive tried ethopian food at a couple of restaurants in Toronto and I always come back to this   Not only because its a great deal (when you buy the groupon) but also because the food is great   The decor at this place is kinda iffy  but the waitress went through great efforts to explain the menu to us and gave us a number of good suggestions on what to get (I cant eat overly spicy foods)   We got an assorted veg/meat platter  a nonspicy beef dish   The portions were generous and tasted great!  Its only been a week since I last came here and I am  having cravings for Ethopian food again   Tip: free parking on the side streets,neutral,3078061

We loved it   The prices are actually pretty reasonable for what you get   The servings here are huge   A small cone could be a large at any other ice cream shop   Yes  theres typically a wait on a Saturday evening after dinner  but thats not uncommon at any decent ice cream shop in Toronto in the summer   The ice cream on my wifes cone was definitely sweeter than my Oreo milkshake  maybe a little too sweet for some   We want to go back with a big group and try the titanic banana split!,positive,6073994

Whats with the sudden surge of soda spots opening up shop?! Say that five times fast  ;)I rarely drink soda  so I am not even remotely in Pops target audience  But I can appreciate their refreshing beverages when the temps hit triple digits in the desert!The Oasis was my first drink of choice  which was fruity and not overly sweet despite the Sprite base  Though their drink menu is a bit smaller than other places around town  I really like how they have multiple options that are not sodabased  like the Flamingo and the High Roller (made with lemonade)   If you need a snack to go with your sips  Pop features sugar cookies for sweet and popcorn for salty ,positive,6341398
KINGS CROWN NACHOS  DELICIOUS Went to Sneaky Dees on a notsobusy afternoon  I understand the whole graffiti interior is a part of the restaurant and its theme  but I wasnt much of a fan  My cousin and I ordered Kings Crown Nachos and it was really good and delicious  Between us two  it was somewhat filling  we were gonna onder a another dish but we decided to just leave and get dessert at another place  Anyways  the sour cream  guac  and frijoles were plenty but I kinda expected a bigger portion  Nevertheless  the nachos here are really good ,positive,3362614
The staff is always very friendly  But  they really need an extra one or two people working there  as it is always a 15 to 20 minute ordeal to get a cup of coffee They also seem to run out of sandwiches often  So an assessment of their inventory requirements would be a good thing It is convenient and I always seem to end up there ,neutral,5018946
This healthyoriented salad / wrap place is great for lunch with its large windows  openair ambiance (although I had to take my order to go  I would have loved to stay and eat!)  I love how well lit this place is! Adds to the earthy feel they are going for  Inside decor is cute and comfortable  and the servers are friendly  This place has an artsy feel to it as well  I got the Grains and Green salad with tofu and it was really tasty  The only downside is that they dont give you a large portion so you may leave hungry despite paying over $10 for the meal  Close to $20 if you get a salmon addon  The tofu isnt too greasy (and its organic!)  My brother got the Indian inspired bowl but it didnt have rice on it  If youre looking for a healthy place to eat this is it! It definitely qualifies for clean eating ,positive,5193131
I actually have never ate inside the restaurant but I wanted to commend the staff that works here for always doing a great job when I order for pick up  My director comes into town a few times a year and every time he comes  we call and make a large order for ramen  Every time Ive called and spoken to someone  they have always been patient and attentive to make sure our order is right  There are times when I am making orders for 10 or more people so I definitely value how patient they are working with us! The majority of us always order their curry ramen but have different add ons  It is very unique and delicious  It tastes like something Ive never had before when it comes to ramen and my director and many of us at work are obsessed with it!  Thanks again for always keeping our tummies full and happy ,positive,1824174
Dined in here for lunch after checking out from our room  We ordered some entrees (burger and fish n chips plate) and cocktails (Purple Reign and Chili Margarita)  Flavors were a bit lacking in the food while the drinks were just okay  The wait was a bit long though the place was empty that day (just us and 2 other tables)  but we were not in a hurry so it wasnt an issue for us  We did enjoy the ambience though and the decors  And our waiter and busboy were polite  So Im giving 4stars for everything else but the lack of flavor ,positive,885653
The employees are super nice however if you need a purse fixed you might want to carefully check all places  I asked if they could fix a purse that was customized by a puppy and they advised they would fix it  Unfortunately it was not the best quality for $95 and they conveniently forgot they were going to touch it up  When I asked for my money back he laughed  Just make sure you get everything in writing and I would get out a couple places  Luckily I didnt bring my nice shoes or luggage here    could have been a more costly mistake ,negative,4824876
Its okay  I went there on a Thursday at 1pm for lunch  I paid like 10 dollar plus tax I dont really recommend it  I thought it was a disappointment  The sushi does not look fresh but it taste okay They have alot of different asian food and seafood  But quality is in question If you like buffet go for it  If not   dont do it    ,neutral,3287733
Do not stay here   Do not consider it   It looks ok from the outside  to lure the unsuspecting person in   Then  you find out what your room  and the clientele  are like   Broken furniture  promised wifi that doesnt work  lousy water  its a hole   With creeps   Stay elsewhere ,negative,904625
Went here on a whim after leaving wet republic  Totally glad they let us in they way we were dressed and slightly intoxicated  We had a party of 9 and was seated within 10 minutes  The design and decor was nice ( what did you expect  it is inside of Aria ) I started with some hot and sour soup which was great  Everyone ordered the satay grill and some chicken wings were ok  I had the basil meat with chicken and asked for level 10 Thai hot  Let me tell you this  it wasnt even a level 5 on a USA hot scale  The dish had flavor but Ive had better  Service was very good  All around decent spot to eat  but for 40$ for a basic Thai meal  I can do WAY better  Probably wouldnt come back unless I am staying at Aria ,neutral,6240419
Currently eating this pizza these teenagers threw together with little to NO care  They barely talk to you and have what it seems like no customer service training  They made my pizza like they were doing it left handed  So annoying ,negative,789450
Agree with the others complaining about staff customer service  the often dire state of the shelves  and the long cashier lines   The thing that really irks me is the customer service   Some staff are lovely but they are in the distinct minority   Proximity is the reason I end up at this establishment but whenever possible I go to the Sobeys on Mount Pleasant ,negative,215251
I joined Yelp just so I could leave a review of this place I went to Philadelphia in the fall and Cheesesteaks are all we could talk about for weeks upon return I went to Philly to get a Cheesesteak   I was not disappointed Yes  it cost more than 5 bucks   It is also not at the edge of civilization   It is in Downtown TO   Genos Steaks in Philly (the original) cost more  This place made me a Cheesesteak with ribeye  and cheesewhiz  just like they make in Philly   It was made to order and man  it did not disappoint   It was good ,positive,2314597

Eat n Park is one of the great things about the Pittsburgh area   Never have I seen a chain diner where the food is so consistently good   Eat n Park blows Dennys and Kings out of the water in terms of quality Now  that doesnt mean that its the best food ever! Its still diner food  and some of it is still going to feel cheapish   BUT their shredded pot roast is excellent  their steak and cheese isnt very Philly  but is very tasty  and I rarely have a bad server here If you want some eats and a bottomless cup of coffee  seek out an Eat n Park!,positive,971213
My 6 year old loved sitting at a hi top table gobbling down his hot dog and grape soda  The mac n cheese was great and homemade  For the price  screw the chains and support something local ,positive,3645590
Just stayed there for 2 nights with the family and enjoyed our stay   We had a street view room facing the library  and so not in the arcade area   The room was huge and clean  and the bathroom was spacious enough   We had great service at checkin and with valet   The location is pretty central in downtown Cleveland  which was great for our plans There is no pool and parking is pricy  otherwise  we were happy with our stay   Oh  they tried to make me pay $10 to connect to WiFi  but I was able to pick up the library WiFi from across the street  Nice  Very nice ,positive,3352203

Im so happy I found this place! I have eaten in once but I get take out very often  I such a huge fan of their Pho  I am actually not that savvy when it comes to Vietnamese food because I just dont know very much about it  but this place is just too good and seems very authentic  Everybody is always so friendly when you walk in and are so eager to help you  Not to mention they have a kickass aquarium  Ive talked to the owner several times and he is very kind  I would definitely recommend this place to everyone looking for good food  :),positive,2951195
Update: 8/30/2017 @ 1:55pmI tried to call to make a to go order and the phone rang and rang and rang  I called 3 times from 2 different numbers and no one answered  Unless you all changed your business hours  there should be someone by the phone  You lose customers this way  Come on PSH get your stuff together ,negative,5774469
Been a customer for years  at least once a week  Took another couple in for dinner and two of the four dinners (sweet and sour chicken and orange chicken) were very over cooked  You couldnt penetrate the chicken with a fork  it was hard as rocks  We called the server over and showed her  She said she could replace one meal with Exact same price meal but not both  and  No refundjust replace one meal  So  you served two poorly cooked entrees but will only replace one  Not how I expect to be treated  so we wont be going back ,negative,462030

Probably about the worst delivery food I have ever had  The calamari was a huge order with  90% tentacles  Just subpar  I got another dish that was supposed to be a corn cake with pork  All it was was a corn tortilla and something unidentifiable  Then the dish that I thought would be the safest which was the steak with plantains and beans  Well look at the photo and tell me if that looks like anything appetizing  Terrible terrible terrible ,negative,4253107
so some friends and I came and plan to purchase the 24 hour pass thinking it was a good idea since we will be leaving the next morning  I even confirmed it with the cashier and I was told that it will end the next day at the time I purchased  so the next day we came and try to get some breakfast and guess what  it last only till 10pm of the day of purchased  total BS!!!!!! they should really inform all theyre staff member and/or get their information straighten out  the food was mediocre and wasnt as variety as I thought it was going to be as they make it to be on their web  dont think Ill be coming back,negative,6629445

This place was everything we expected! Bubbas shrimp n grits were to die for! Catfish was lightly breaded with corn meal not  the typical flour concoction It was a perfect for a Sunday morning  Dont be in a hurry  Enjoy a drink and conversation with the owners if you can  I highly recommend! Well do our best to keep this place a successful addition to the neighborhood ,positive,5551468

I had the Traditional Aussie Meat Pie  Minced beef in a savoury gravy with a touch of vegemite Loved this!! The meat was very delicious and went well with the gravy  The gravy was just the perfect amount  it wasnt soupy inside nor overpower the meat  The pastry was very fluffy  and to which I find they use butter instead of shortening (a win!)  As they recommend  best enjoyed with ketchup  Initially I was skeptical about adding ketchup because meat plus gravy was perfect already for me  But after trying it with ketchup  there is the salt  sour combination from the gravy and ketchup that just made everything more delicious!The fresh cut fries were awesome too!Also had their Flat White  This was a damn good flat white  using beans from Propeller Coffee  Love the taste and the smoothness of the drink  And best of all  I didnt feel the acidity that I feel on others I will be back to try the other interesting pies like Kiwi Classic  El Diablo and The Canadian ,positive,2154834
Not a place I go to during the day but late night when they start smoking the meat outside on the BBQ it is as good as it gets in Toronto    Jerk HAS to be done on a coal BBQ to get that taste you get in Yard   will never taste as good as you get REAL chicken in JA but this is about as close as it getsNEVER go to the spot a few doors down just to save wait time  they are not nearly as goodThey cook until 46 in the morning so this is THE alternative to McDonalds if you are willing to driveWhoever decided to keep them open until extreme late night is a genius    luckily I live right beside the highway so the drive is not that big of an issue I usually just get the $10 dollar chicken  load it with the sauce they have  add some hot sauce  and remember the times in Ochi,positive,3921039
So Ive been here a few times and every time I go it seems like of youre not a regular you dont get service as quick!! Somewhat annoying as we are all paying customers and should be granted the same service! As for the food  its okay ,negative,4484329
While my dogs looked and smelled awesome and they did the cuts exactly how I wanted  my yorkie came home with 3 small cuts on her (one on top of each wrist and one on her stomach)   I know she can squirm  but I was not made aware of these injuries and the one on her stomach is obvious! Im really disappointed because this groomer was close to my house and the staff was wonderful    Needless to say by omitting that this happened   I will not return ,neutral,6382250

Disappointed!  I made a reservation a week Ago and yet it took 30 min to get our table  The food was descent but for the price  there are better places to eat  Also its a tap house but the selection of beers is limited  Luckily the company was great and thats what matters most  I probably would rather go to Brasserie V instead  We went here because they take reservations but that didnt do us any good anyway  I really wanted to like it but Jacs but they fell short of my expectations and didnt do anything for not having our reservation ready for 30 min  Not even an apology ,negative,890643

I didnt love these cupcakes   I thought they were dry and the icing was kinda gross  Maybe Ive been spoiled because I live in California and have eaten some great( and not so great) cupcakes   For 1 75  they were passable   Better than a supermarket cupcake   In cali  we pay 3 for a cupcake so when I saw a groupon for 6 for 5 00  I bought it    I ended up tossing 3 of them in the trash because by the next day  they were really dry ,negative,2004685
Im not a sports fan but have friends who are  This is a great place for all of us to go when theres a game  Not a crazy sports bar atmosphere but plenty of huge TVs to enjoy the game  Great menu and beer list  I order mussels everywhere they are offered and these are the best in the area! Order extra garlic toast to get all of the good broth  Meatloaf sliders were delicious ,positive,2932468

Old Italian guy runs this place and hes quite a charmer  The repair that I needed was replacement of the back heels of my boots  Price seemed reasonable ($15) and they were ready within the time that I asked for (a lil bit less than 24 hrs)  The only thing that prevented me from giving this place 1 more star was that the repair guy asked for payment up front  I would have DEFINITELY argued but my slow hubby was holding the money out   ARRGGGHHH!!! Anyway  no worries  Got my boots ,positive,4029765
These 5 stars are solely for their spicy olive bread  Everything else here is probably 5 stars too  but I just havent tried it yet ,positive,5087819

Food poisoning was a result of my meal at this restaurant Sunday December 7th  a day which repeated itself with horrible effects from the ingestion of their regular salad and moussaka  I heard from others their Greek food was very good  so my BF and I went that night  He ordered the Greek salad and shrimp dish and myself the above listed meal  About 4am Monday morning I started to feel violently ill  I was sick all day Monday and very weak on Tuesday  My BF also became very ill as well   He can barely get out of bed now I had to send my moussaka back once as it was cold In the middle  yet hot around the edges  It was returned to me just barely warmed in the middle but hot around the edges  I should have known better not to partake of this food I did file with the health department  but knowing government agencies as I do  nothing will be accomplished I am from out of state and this is real fun to the start of my week long vacation in PIT ,negative,1217275

OMG  I loved this place and their mouthwatering chocolate fountain  So cool! I decided that I had to get one of their fancy desserts and it was not only beautiful and tasted amazing  it was well worth the pretty penny that I paid for it!

First time i had to use urgent care and I went in around 8:30 and they close at 9:00 they were very nice and helpful and after poking and prodding me got me a prescription that had this sticker on it and saved me like 150 dollars since I dont have insurance  really nice people  loved them for helping me ,positive,1168826
Kekou is really good and its a shame Yelp doesnt do halfstars  because this place is more like 4 5 stars The gelato here is great and it is good quality  I love the fact that they try to keep it as simple as possible and limiting their ingredients to the basics  although this could mean the gelato here not being as smooth as other places  There are always very interesting flavours here and I almost always find myself ordering at least 2 scoops!They also serve tea  but of course  no one ever comes here for tea ,positive,3367139

If you want to relive those memories in real time  go to Dutch Dreams   From the fever dream aesthetics to the real whipped cream  DD knows how to do ice cream right   This Dream isnt cheap  but its well worth the cost to get lost in a mountain of delicious ice cream   Sit at Drakes table ,positive,4333988
To completely oppose everything that Albert H  (below me) said  as he seems to love frequenting local Starbucks and bashing all of them    I think this location is fantastic!!! As an employee at this particular coffee company  I dont normally like to hang out where I work  but this store offers a quiet  comfortable atmosphere away from the hustle and bustle of everyday life The staff is always friendly and happy to see me  and would know me drink by heart if I wasnt always changing it up! The drinks might not come out the fastest  but their quality surpasses most of the Starbucks I have visited; they take the time to put a lot of care into the making of my delicious coffeebased beverages  and it never goes unnoticed The only reason this location gets 4 stars is because its not my store! ),positive,5676152
My review is predominately based on the fact that we were here with a close friend who has a high level sales job at the hotel  so our experience on NYE was extra special  We came here after the Bruno Mars concert  walked right in to our table and enjoyed the rest of the evening / morning  The dancers were great  the music was perfect  but of course very loud  The service was outstanding and we never had an empty drink  I couldnt believe how many people were still in line at 1:30am  While we had an awesome night  I dont have the patience to ever wait in that type of line  Great way to close out NYE!,positive,3806178

This is my favorite spot in Tempe  I usually order for delivery  but I have dined in a couple times   The place is family run so the employees actually care  Delivery is consistent 3040 min   Drivers are nice  Food is great   I am picky with my Chinese food and this place meets my standards   The vegetables are always hot yet crisp so I know they use fresh vegetables  Unlike other places where the vegetables are soggy  Spice can be altered on every dish on a scale from 1 to 10  I usually order the level 4 spice  which is really spicy for me  but oh so good  Basically  best Chinese place in Tempe!,positive,5280378
Such a great happy hour! And they do it 7 days a week     Only gripe is that its at the bar only and sometimes its a little tight seating      Best thing we had was the cauliflower/date dish  Amazing!!! And their signature martini cocktail! Must try if you like sweeter cocktails ,positive,4632420
I love this place!!! Ive gone here a few times and all times have been amazing  The most recent visit was my favorite because their new tech Jasmine was working on my nails and she did so good  I love how she was talking to me  so customer service was definitely up to par  My go to spot  and as long as Jasmine is working here  she will be my go to nail tech!,positive,2445803

Great indoor place  Best in south Calgary not the best for value and size in Calgary  Staff are friendly  Lots of sitting area  Medium size playground with slides to trampoline to ball room to jungle room  Arcade size is decent that takes in house tokens with about 10 games and air hockey table of course  Toddler zone too as playground is for 3 and up  Overall decent value for kids birthday parties and when winter and rainy days are here ,positive,1502633
Excellent food but very LOUD!!!!!!! Almost impossible to talk  which for me ruined the whole experience  That being said the food was top notch  beautifully presented and cooked to perfection  If I could go back knowing I could now hold a conversation without straining to hear every word I would go back  but otherwise I would have to pass ,positive,1039141
Love this place  Come at least once a week   They recently changed management and the new team is great   Ignore old reviews with bad service   New manager will greet you as old friend and talk youre ear off   Really nice guy   Staff is now very attentive  Go  you wont be sorry ,positive,3528999
This place is my favorite place to eat in Charlotte  NC  I brag about it all the time  I took my family there for fathers day and the server was so rude  She acted as though everything we asked her was a hassle  The drinks did not have enough ice and when she brought it (ice) out  she set it down and rolled her eyes  She charged my card 3 times and the other 2 charges were over $150  When I called the manager/owner he was so rude and was yelling at me in the phone   Not once did he offer an apology  He kept saying I dont know what happened  I LOVE the food here and cannot imagine why an owner would be so rude to a guest  My advice to you is  if you want good food and atmosphere   try THE LIBERY! If you are looking for great service   try SOMEWHERE ELSE  They need a lesson in customer service  especialy if the owner acts this way ,negative,5490505
My sister and I had gone out yesterday to look for a sweater/jacket  We had gone to this convenient location off the I17 freeway and did not find what we were looking for  The store layout had me thinking I was in a thrift store  The pricing was reasonable for the selection they had out on the clean sales floor  We also were not greeted nor received any service by a sales associate while we were shopping as the sales associates never attempted to make my shopping experience better    sadly my sister and I left without making a purchase   (Thank you for reading this review  I am writing reviews of everywhere I eat when I dine out  places I shop  movies I watch and much more  Stay posted with #ReviewByMariaMescal),negative,3810119
This place is pretty terrible  I went in with chest pain and a fever that had been going on for 10 days  After what seemed like a WebMD check list he diagnosed me with costochondritis which is basically a result of strenuous pain on the chest caused by impact  As a result  the Dr  Simply said over the counter ibuprofen would do the trick (I was doing that for 10 days  bud) 2 days later I went to the E R and was diagnosed with pneumonia  I couldnt help but look back and think they just wanted to get me out of there as they were sweeping  wiping down desks and throwing out that days garbage  What a lack of thoroughness ,negative,5501239

530 on a Friday night  we walked in and waited for them to make a space at the sushi bar as it was covered with dirty dishes and it was filthy  The waitress had an attitude  walked up basically shoved all the dirty crap from one side to the other to make a space in the middle so we would be flanked by dirty piled up dishes  It was unsanitary  it was gross  and the waitress had a major attitude  And there was nobody in the restaurant  it was basically empty  If they cant keep up with their business in an empty restaurant what happens when its fullThe last time we went the service was also poor  and added unsanitary conditions  we will not return,negative,64362
Clean  well stocked  and very efficient checkout  far better than my normal Vons and nearly as convenient when you take into account the lack of having to venture into Boca Park   Prices trend a bit higher than WalMart and nonorganic vegetables are sometimes limp  but byandby a quality grocery store with good  prices and all the essentials ,positive,746344
Im very suspicious of the reviews that are below 3  I havent been here with anyone over some twenty years of going that didnt love the pizza  Does it need a facelift? Maybe/ probably  Is the service great? Probably not but it has fantastic food and is very reasonably priced  There is a ton of WT in this area and I wonder how many of yall (intentional) were trying to get something free from the jump  This is easily one of the best pizza places in Mesa and to me its as good as anywhere Ive had around the valley  Treat yourself and grab a pizza from here    but unfortunately you cant catch a movie next store at AMC like the good ol days ,positive,2962086

That tasted like none of the ingredients and the only taste familiar was that it was kind of like rancid olive oil (yes  olive oil goes bad!)

Ive stayed at many hotels on the strip  but this experience of staying at the Venetian far exceeds that of all my other vegas experiences  The room is HUGE  beautiful  comfortable and luxurious  As a girl all I need is a huge space  nice view and CLEAN bathroom  Lets talk about the bathroom: 1 shower 1 bath  a separate room for the toilet  2 different sinks  huge bathroom  lots of mirrors  white tiles  AND best part yet: a separate makeup station  with a chair and magnified mirror  Lovely stay We also got insuite dining part of the deal  Felt like a queen to be honest  Lol,positive,3075247
I couldnt wait to try Giadas Vegas restaurant because all of her recipes that Ive made at home are impeccable (Im a huge fan!)  The restaurant is gorgeousbright  chic  with lots of personal touches   Server Elena was excellent   I went for breakfast and had coffee and the Caprese Frittata  which was unfortunately overcooked  I got a spongy egg patty with raw caprese elements sitting on top   Usually a frittata has the nonegg ingredients incorporated into it  so thats what I was expecting   The patty had sundried tomatoes cooked in it which was kinda weird with the fresh tomatoes on top   There are so many other restaurants in LV that Im not sure Ill make it back to this one   For reference: http://www bonappetit com/testkitchen/commonmistakes/article/frittatacommonmistakes,neutral,1990812

Slum lords  Once you move into one of their places beware  You wont ever hear from them again  The first time I needed a repair  the maintenance guy warned me to be careful because every service call results in a higher rent if I decide to renew  And it took him 5 days to come out  You will NEVER see your deposit back and I had the place professionally cleaned AND had the rugs professionally cleaned as well  With receipts  And you better list EVERY minor detail upon move in because they WILL charge you for it when you move out  They charged me to repair nail holes from the previous owner that were there when I moved in (I didnt even hang anything on the walls)  Ive rented for most of my life and this was by far the worst mgmt company I have ever dealt with ,negative,4463649
Heard good things about this place  Nice ambiance & vibe  Amazing & creative menu we were excited about eating here  Had an awesome waiter best service during entire trip actually! The buffalo fries w/ the blue cheese were delicious & huge portion! The spicy or Cajun chicken breasts were a bit dry & small & asparagus was over cooked  Maybe it was an off day or a mess up  Probably wouldnt eat here again though w/ all of the fabulous restaurant options in Vegas  They were busy & it was Cinco de Mayo so maybe that was it ,neutral,1722463

Food was mediocre meh We ordered pepperoni pizza and the mushroom pasta based on pictures on yelp  Pepperoni pizza (3/5): it was really mediocre  Nothing special  Id honestly say that blaze pizza on Dundas was better than this  Mushroom pasta (2/5): it was supposed to be mushroom truffle pasta so I was expecting something like the mushroom pasta from gusto 101  Instead we got a mushy mess  Lol  Dont recommend :/ sorry ,negative,1234650
My new favorite restaurant in the Phoenix area! (Foodwise)If you like Mediterranean (American styled  of course)  this is THE place to eat in Phoenix  The lamb is great when cooked medium rare  which is VERY VERY hard to find! The atmosphere is Greek flaired  but nothing incredible  The service is spectacular  But it is always the food that makes or breaks the place  and My Big Fat Greek Restaurant hits the spot If there is any downside  it is that every time I finish one of their ample sized plates  I have to hit the gym to avoid becoming a big fat something else Get the Slouvaki plates!,positive,3795937
I enjoyed my meal and the service was very excellent    Ryan was our server and was very professional    The place is intimate and deserves to be up held a a great experience for great dining ,positive,2044890
My absolute favorite coffee shop in Cleveland! This place ticks all the boxes: amazing coffee  a bunch of options  yummy bakery treats and a cozy vibe for when you want to sit and stay awhile  Today I grabbed the promise land latte and a chocolate chip cookie to go  It was the highlight of my day  Check this place out  It is the real deal ,positive,3651747
Follow Scott A s advice: Get the oneofeach  extra chili This will be a knife and fork sort of lunch  so keep that in mind  Or be sure to grab plenty of napkins  Either way  the coney dog was fantastic and the loose meat sandwich was awesome (though slightly salty  but still good)  I also ordered the fries which were the perfect accompaniment for the chili topped delights  Because that chili is magical  I tell you! I licked the box clean As others have mentioned  they have Faygo pop there  and even Michigan boxed water  There is also a map in the back wall where you can use a push pin to show where in Detroit youre from  Sadly  I grew up in Ohio so wont be adding my claim to fame ,positive,1193493
Just had lunch at GO VEGAN CAFE and it was awesome  I am from Southern California  vegan Mecca  and this place is up there with best  If you are a pretentious turd the quaint/cute atmosphere may not be up to your shitty standards but if not it is great  Staff is friendly and helpful  food is great  and there are vegan/gluten free desserts ,positive,3336074

Normally I wouldnt write a review for a place like Friendlys  its a great place to bring the kids  has decent food  and the ice cream sundaes are worth a stop alone   However  this Friendlys was absolutely filthy when we came in Now had we been in during a peak dining time (or perhaps immediately after) I wouldve understood a lessthan clean restaurant  but we came in around 3pm and there was only 1 other table occupied   It looked as if an entire kindergarten class had a field day in there with no adult supervision   There were french fries and gummi bears strewn across the floor  dirty napkins and plates still on tables (they were still there when we left)  crumbled crayons everywhere   it was a mess   To top it off  not a single staff member was actively cleaning the entire time we were there and I saw at least 5 people working at the time   Makes me wonder what kind of state the kitchen is in   You may want to just stick with the ice cream at this location!,negative,3913378
While traveling this weekend  my boyfriend and I realized his drivers side tail light was out  The bulb was easy to get to  so he decided to just take care of the repair himself  When we returned to town we swung on over to Auto Zone to pick up a replacement  The store is pretty densely packed  but we were able to just hop in line at the register  tell the clerk what kind of car my boyfriend drives  and the clerk walked him over to the bulbs and grabbed exactly what he needed  My boyfriend was able to then walk back to the register and pay  Super easy and we were in and out in under five minutes  As someone who knows basically nothing about cars its good to know I can come in and get someone to help me find exactly what I need ,neutral,6386794
Real Tennis players and coaches work here!Why go to a big box sports store when you can find a better selection (you have never seen this many racquets before)  a nicer more experienced staff  and a discount stringing service right here?If you like Tennis (or want to try) this is a great place to start  they can even recommend where to get lessons  I picked up a used $300 prince racquet in perfect condition (new wrap and strings too) for only $50!FYI  8 beginner lessons via the ATA (Arizona Tennis Association) is only $100!,positive,4291503

I agree with the previous poster that their beds arent that strong  Ive been alternating between this location  which is close to my home  and another chain  which is close to my work  for 6 months now and always seem to get better results from the latter Although I would have initially rated my 6 months as their customer as average (3 stars)  Ive taken the time to write this 1 star review to warn potential customers to READ THE FINE PRINT of any contract you sign  I was informed today that because I didnt give a full 30days notice that Id be moving to an area with no Celebrity Tanning locations that Id be forced to pay my scheduled payment (which is still over 2 weeks away) for a full month of tanning that I wont be at all able to use because they have no flexibility in their policy  I guess the extra $33 is worth it to them not to have a repeat customer when I move back in 8 months  Oh well ,negative,1829163
Dirty Dirk  our drive was hilarious and kept us entertained with his dad jokes  Mind you this is an all day event  got picked up from the hotel at 6:50am (the Tuscany)  got dropped off around 9:30pm  Stopped twice on the way there once for a break and another for a lunch buffet  included in the price  Pretty good tour  the only thing would be better if there were tour guides once you get there  youre kinda by yourself to figure it all out ,positive,888541
Im not sure what happened to Luisas  They used to be really good but my most recent take out order was absolutely horrible  I had ordered a small pizza  fried mushrooms and a meatball sub  The meatball sub was the best of the bunch but it wasnt that great  There were 3 meatballs in a roll and very little sauce so basically it was all bread  The mushrooms were horrible with too much breading and no flavor  And the pizza was just as bad  No flavor  hardly any sauce I used to love Luisas  Something had to have changed with their staff or menu  This was not good at all ,negative,2938542

The nicest LCBO I have been to   They have an incredibly large section  especially the vintages   The fact that its in an old train station make it really beautiful   Ive only been here a handful of times  but they always have something going on in their event section   The last time it was a Caribbean theme and they had music  rum to taste  and an assortment of cold and hot food   There were a bunch of brochures and treat bags as well   They will actually throw private parties in there too with cooking and wine tastings ,positive,4936076
You go to the yard if youre a bro or want to go on a date but not actually speak to one another  Its insanely loud  extremely crowded and overall  not worth it  You cant connect with the person youre with  even hear the waitress/waiter speak  Its a good place to go on game day when you want to drink from a can and play ping pong  Sad to see Sam Fox make a restaurant like this ,negative,6522185

The food was mediocre   The french fries were terrible  Soggy and tasteless   Even worse  I hope none of us get sick   There was a man in a white coat checking the food as it was passed to him from the kitchen   He touched every order  no gloves   Worse he was coughing and sneezing  never washing his hands   I saw him several times touch his face and rub his nose  also never washing his hands   With those same unwashed hands  he touched every surface in the place   He walked over to the area where customers pick up condiments  to speak to an employee restocking the area   While there he pushed down on the napkin dispenser with the same unwashed hands   Anyone wiping their mouths or faces on those napkins will catch his cold  YUCK!!,negative,4885437
My codiner and I thought the same thing  wheres the burger?  We both got different burgers and we both enjoyed our toppings  but neither of us could taste any sort of flavor in the burger and the texture was lacking too   Neither of ours were cooked to the ordered temperature either  so we had one overcooked and one undercooked burger  neither of which tasted like anything   I am not even going to waste my time reviewing the sides and drinks  since the name of the place is Brgr and that should be the reason to go ,negative,3671503
So this place is great if you want to get pills for all sorts of problems  When it comes down to being a doctor  they are the worst  Miss diagnosed 3 times and let alone the prices for all their treatments  On top of that  they charge for paperwork that needs to be filled out for employers when you get sick  Over all  my doctor now  Is not a doctor at all!!!!!!,negative,4522320

For those that live here we know that Onnix has had its problems lately  and to be fair the staff has been trying hard to fix them  The water shut offs are just as embarrassing to them as it is annoying for us  I was actually about ready to call it quits until I spoke to Deb Spyre in the front office  She was very professional and kind when she explained to me that they were trying to get everything fixed and convinced me to sign another lease with MarkTaylor  She was very knowledgeable on everything that has happened and understood how it felt  which is a relief because water shut offs are a real pain  Her customer service is one of the only reasons I stayed  All in all though  I have seen Onnix at its worst and it has been getting better ,positive,1263669

The Arbys at Whitehall Commons is better than the average Arbys location in decor and presentation; it is one of the few I know where all employees where white dress shirts   The location is clean  with stations not messy and tables typically cleaned in a timely manner The food though is typical for an Arbys; the quality is no different from this one with any other location   I typically never have an issue with orders at the front or drivethru areas   They also accept coupons that locals receive in mailers   Overall  its an okay location  though I believe that people never plan to go to Arbys  they just happen to go on a whim   Whatever the case may be  it should be alright ,neutral,4723835

Located in Town Square  Sephora offers top of the line make up options  Whether youre in the market to redo your whole makeup routine or just in need of a new mascara Sephora is a great stop for advice and to trying out new products  You can try out a lot of products there  but not everything  Be sure to sanitize with alcohol for items like lipsticks! Even if its just on your hand  There are workers who can give you a mini make over to help you educate on how to use certain products like highlighters or gel lip liners If you dont like the color or the effect created be sure to say something as to what you like or dont like  about it  It will help the artist and you figure out what will work for you  You can sign up for the Beauty Insider rewards for free  You can earn free trial size samples and if you spend enough in a year you can get into  exclusive beauty events  Will be back for sure ,positive,3445987

Whoa       food that is fast  on the cheap side  and its not greasy  disgusting crap like McDonalds?  Awesome       Ate here at around 11 PM on a Thursday night and went with the Full Montagu (Roasted Beef  Turkey  Swiss & Cheddar Cheese  Lettuce  Tomato & Mustard)   Ingredients were fresh  sandwich was served warm  and bread was soft and chewy and yet a little crispy   A good place in Vegas to grab a quick bite without being relegated to eating garbage ,positive,6392414

We were craving some dim sum during our visit to Montreal and were shocked that there were so few places  The reviews on Yelp/Google were dicey  but we decided to take a chance on Kim Fung anyway  The restaurants entrance is in a small mall and theres signage both in/outside to help you locate it  We visited on Friday around 11AM  it wasnt crowded so we were seated immediately  The food carts came around very frequently and the food was fresh and delicious  They served pretty basic dim sum  har gow  shrimp noodles  spring rolls  shu mai  etc  The check was a little pricey  but we ate a ton of food  They didnt hound us for a tip  but they did ask how much change we wanted back  Overall  it was a pretty similar experience to many of the NYC dim sum places we go to ,positive,6157030

I wanted to love this place; and on my first visit I was disappointed  Slightly different options than Chipotle but really the extras here are spinach and maybe a special dressing?

Lil Louie is the bomb  Wife and I went in with no idea what we wanted and Louie had the patience to narrow it down to a very commemorative tattoo design  Even went the extra mile and drove us to the airport!

I spent 15 years in the flavor business  specializing in Ice Cream  This place is #1  in my book The Madagascar Vanilla is supurb  The Real Mint Chip is made with locally grown mint leaves instead of mint oil or flavor  and they have this Lavender ice cream that is beyond description  The flavor starts out light  almost unnoticeable  Then it slowly grows in intensity and becomes this unbelievable tongue massage of flavor  with a clean aftertaste  Its simply the most well behaved flavor Ive ever had  after Vanilla ,positive,2597885

This place is okay  My wife and I were out for her birthday  She is a picky eater  but loves Italian  This year we just decided to not make a lot of plans and see where we ended up  She decided she wanted to head towards Downtown Summerlin  and we ended up at this place inside of Red Rock Casino  We walked in and sat down almost immediately  the place was nice but they have tables crammed in  We were at a small (emphasis on small) two top in the middle  The whole time we felt like we were in the way  The restaurant was not full  so not horrible  but I could only imagine if it was full  The server was nice  The food was pretty good  not great but good  They dont offer any kind of birthday dessert (not a big deal just letting everyone know)  it was kind of a bummer though since we were there to celebrate  We decided to get ice cream elsewhere  Overall Salute is a decent place to eat  but I wouldnt go out of my way ,neutral,5495075

Interesting mix of cuisine (Japanese  Peruvian  and Brazilian)  Sounds like a potentialy disgusting combo  but it actually works very well  Try their signature sushi rolls  Theyre extremely good  They also have more Sake than Japan it seems  About a 6 page menu to select from  They also have amazing muddled fruit cocktails  Now  the negatives  As sushi goes  and tapas for that matter  its slightly pricey  I know its Vegas  but some things such as sushi just cant go higher than a certain price  The second thing is the fact they have an amazing modern space  but then have a giant screen tv playing football  Why dumb down a hip place  Oh well ,positive,3195856
my review is primarily based on customer service not really on the quality of the food  i purchased a whole tray of bread pudding for a company function  i understand it was pretty good as far as taste goes but one of my members attending the function bit into a stone and broke a tooth when biting into some bread pudding  he was more than a little upset for sure  i took the stone and tray (that i borrowed) to the store and spoke to someone in charge and explained that someone broke a tooth on a stone that was in his bread pudding  the manager offered me half of a shrug  barely an apology and did i want a single serving of cake to go i said so thats it? he said well what do you want me to say and so i will never be back  i hold these functions monthly and would happily get food there again as it is close to my house/job but not ever again  customer service is crummy!!,negative,6613860
The ice cream looks great in pictures  That and the good reviews got us to choose this as our dessert spot for the night  The service was good  we got to try a few of the flavors before making a decision  We decided to share a cup with salted caramel and the cherry swirl (I think thats what it was called) flavors which were then topped with a coconut macaron and a toasted marshmallow  It looked really great! Eating the ice cream wasnt as great because the macaron was rock solid and hard to get through with our spoons  The ice creams were also very sweet  make sure you have a cup of water next to you!,neutral,4909829
I went here for lunch not too long ago   The food was great   This is the cheapest place in the city to get a pint of beer as well  anyone who says Pabst is garbage doesnt know what theyre talking about   However  the wait staff was slow and inexperienced   Along with waiting forever to receive my order  the waitress forgot my order of beer and took her sweet time bringing over the bill at the end of my meal   I would have given this establishment another star if the waitresses were more competent ,neutral,2794968

I needed my eyebrows waxed pretty badly and didnt know where to go so I turned to trusty Yelp and found this little joint  I called and they were able to take me in right away  The guy on the phone was friendly and accommodating  Brittany was absolutely wonderful  Not only did she do a fabulous job  but she was also extremely friendly and sweet  Matthew did my friends eyebrows and he was also funny and did a great job  I really liked the fact that not only do they do waxing but they also do hair  it shows that they are multitalented  The vibe of this place is great too  Its got a graffiti  street thing going on thats really cool  I look forward to returning to get my eyebrows done again and also to get my hair done as well Be sure to bring change because the parking is metered during the week!,positive,2488278
The best thing about this buffet  in my opinion  is the dessert bar: tons of selections and most pastries/cakes come straight from Jean Philippe Patisserie! I came hungry  after reading reviews and the restaurant guide from Aria  I knew I had to save room for dessert  You wont be disappointed eating here if youve got a sweet tooth!The entrees/selections were OK  price was $38 99 per person on a Saturday night  which comes with unlimited wine & a lobster for two  plus endless supply of food from the buffet Some notable items on the buffet were the sushi bar  tandoori chicken  freshly baked naan  grilled salmon  and king crab legs  We made our own dipping sauce using butter  pepper  salt  and lemons It was delicious and a great experience here ,positive,4791916
Where to begin with this place: Literally one of the worst pizza experiences of my life  The dough was undercooked and soggy on the bottom  The sauce was sweet and tasted like it was from a can (It totally was out of a can)  The cheese was like rubber and had no flavour  The veggies were raw: Big chucks of raw onion and mushrooms  Thankfully the roasted red peppers were from a jar  so they were cooked at least  Then the meat; the pepperoni was inedible  uncooked slices of cardboard  The rosemary  tinted Krustybrand imitation gruel Italian sausage was also a disaster  Tasted like when you go a friends house and they have no clue how to cook  Save your money ($34) for a large and 3545 min and go anywhere other than this sore excuse for a deep dish (or any) pizza place  1 star is generous ,negative,6375015

I found out about this place from the owner of the indian grocery that I shop at  Went there for the lunch buffet on a weekday and for the price it was good  More meat options than vegetarian  but still enough vegetarian food to fill me up  The vegetarian options included Jerra Aloo  palak paneer  and a black channa  All tasty with the complimentary dosas   Only reason why I didnt give it five stars was because they didnt have my favorite chutney and the buffet prices were a mystery until we paid  The layout is L shaped and a little awkward but the people are friendly and the food was good  We will most likely go back in a few months ,positive,2065193
I stopped in after work to check it out since Ive heard sooo much about it   The happy hour menu offers many affordable choices  So I started off with the cocktail of the day which was $6  Im definitely not a professional at happy hour so the drink was very strong for me   I sent it back in exchange for a glass of cab  Sometimes you have to stick with what you know   Bartenders are very into their cocktails which seems intimating a bit to me   If you want a great cocktail then this your place!,neutral,2612767

I came back the very next day and ate again  Compliments to the Chef and the staff was really awesome and hospitable!,positive,692029
We love picking up Anns and do it at least biweekly  Always ordering their orange chicken  plain lo mein  egg drop soup and either egg rolls or crab puffs  It is always quick  easy and affordable in addition to being absolutely delicious! No complaints and we are thankful to contribute to a family business!,positive,6068270
The Great Escape Canada is a good place to go to  but falls shorts when compared to the other elite escape rooms in the city  I tried the Hangover and the concept was fantastic  However  the immersive atmosphere just was not there  It was lacking that professional feel that other rooms in the city excel at  The room(s) featured some amazing props  that were also mixed in with quite a bit of cheap props  which did not add to the atmosphere and just ended up creating a mess  With that being said  it is definitely a fun with a group of friends  However  there is quite a significant difference between The Great Escape Canada and other highly reviewed escape rooms available in the city ,neutral,4739061

My husband and I went here on our first date night in months  and we are so glad we picked Brasserie  The food is AMAZING we both could not get enough  and that Earl Grey Creme Brulee is insane it so good! The servers we had were awesome  super friendly  gave great recommendations on food and what to have to drink with it  We cannot stop raving about this place  it is actually the reason I signed up for Yelp was to give them a great review  Haha! We cannot wait to go back!,positive,3773724

A year later and we had a nice pizza lunch at Five50  Service was quick and attentive  Water glasses were promptly filled and everything was great    except   the same issue with the pizza centers being thinner than the rest of the pizza where it even caused one piece that was being pulled from the pizza pan to leave the tip of the slice behind  Pizza flavors were great and being the creatures of habit that we are  we ordered the margherita and the Gotham pizza  We got the chefs choice charcuterie board and Humboldt Fog goat cheese that spread so smoothly like a soft cream cheese over the crostini to make a perfect little spot for the cured meats  I better stop  I want more  Found out  by the way  the cheese is at Whole Foods  First stop when I get home ,positive,130785

Delicious cake!

Super cute classic French style bistro with wonderful prix fixe that is just spectacular   We walked in late the day after Xmas and they were kind enough to seat us and offer some of the best service Ive had in a restaurant   The server was incredibly sweet  kind  funny  generous  and patient   We ordered the beef and duck breast  and both were made to absolute perfection  Their poutine is small but exquisite   Bring your bottle of wine and enjoy it with your meal  with no corkage fee   Lovely  relaxing  classic ,positive,4645169

I use to love gordon Ramsey but not anymore  I doubt he would have eaten the pork belly that was a dish comprised of more than 50% fat  My DH had the hanger steak and fries  Hanger steak was tough and fries undercooked  Really undercooked fries To add insult Im pretty sure we got food poisoning from the hanger steak  Highlights of the meal were the pear cider and sticky toffee pudding  Service was ok  Save yourself the grief and eat somewhere else ,negative,2659167
This is my favourite AYCE sushi restaurant in Markham  The prices are decent  especially with their 10% off coupon  The sushi is always fresh and food comes out pretty fast  Their nonsushi options like beef ribs are also delicious  I avoid this place during the lunch crowd as it is popular with people who work in Markham  Show up at 1pm and its pretty easy to get a table They recently experimented with some new desert options  The creme brule was more like a creme caramel  Stick with the green tea and red bean ice cream The service has some room for improvement  Often i will sit there with an empty tea cup  I have to work to flag someone down  and they will come pretty quickly ,positive,5281216
Great selection of Pittsburgh sports items   They have both clothes and home goods   Some of the items are made by local folks and not licensed  so if you are looking for budget friendly options they may have something for you ,positive,1565306
Thank you Chris for your reply to my review  However  much of what you said is just not the truth and I find it sad that the responsibility was not placed where it should have been   Communication was horrible about the delay in getting payment for claims  I just was simply not aware until it was too late   That you just cannot refute when you look at the records  Moving on ,negative,4708946
Probably the best BBQ I have had in Vegas  Great service  clean and friendly  Their side items are YUMO!

I continue to be astounded by the apathy displayed by businesses who spend big $$$ on advertising to get new patients  but do nothing to retain their current client base  We recently moved and being long time customers of VCA Apache Junction (LOVE THEM!)  we decided to just transfer our animals care and their records to VCA Northern  BIG MISTAKE  Even though I called days in advance to make an appointment and have my records there for the new Vet  when I arrived this morning  they wanted me to fill out new paperwork with my name  address  blah  blah  blah REALLY? The whole point in us choosing a national chain was so that no matter where we were traveling  etc  they would have access to our record at a moments notice via computer  I guess that is not the case  Now  the one advantage I thought was present  is not  No reason to continue a relationship with VCA Northern ,negative,1986873
I was one of the two other individuals who wasMentioned in a previous post  As well as a customer from the get go of this establishment and frequent patron  Body language has a lot to do with how you get service  We came in  greeted our bartender joyfully and received prompt service as we both acknowledged one another   At no point in time was there any negativity of a beautiful German Shepard sitting at the bar  In fact  it went unnoticed     No conversation ever took place nor was anything ever mentioned of one being uncomfortable with disabled individuals   So I guess in conclusion  Id give ten stars to this place  and not really trust customers from the start review the moment they get bad service   I bet every other time his service was stellar but failed to recognize that  instead  bash a person and try to downgrade a place of business   Cheers!,positive,2747387
Love Dutch Bros  but do they have to ask me what Im doing or where Im going every time I buy a coffee? And its at every location! Management needs to drop this  its become redundant  Sometimes I go to Starbucks to just not hear them ask for once ,positive,3469145
So we get that pretty late and its my group of friends which there was 4 of us and the bartender and his twoFriends   I put $10 in the juke box and pay a little extra so my songs will play next   We didnt plan on staying too long so we paid a little more   The bartender said it would be about an hour before my songs played   We ordered a round of drinks and then my songs came on   The bartender skipped over all my songs that I paid for   Also after that the bartender refused to serve us again   My group wasnt even very drunk   When my friend asked why the bartender said no Im not serving you   I understand they have the right to refuse service but it seemed like he wanted us gone so he could hang out with his friends and listen to music   Last time I went there I didnt have these issues but it was a different bartender   I definitely wont be returning to this bar ever again ,negative,4525590
Go hungry is my best advice! Because  after youve eaten  theyll have to wheel you out of there!! First trip  on the advice of a friend and what a pleasant surprise! Monstrous portions  helpful staff  and the flavors are outofthisworlddelicious  The wings were plump and juicy  the onion rings crisp  and the sweet potato fries (actually more like tater tots) were wonderful  I had the Bigger Beefstro Burger and it was cooked to perfection  The burger was piled high with shaved rib eye and havarti cheese  on a pretzel bun  my mouth is watering  just writing about it  We also had the bacon blue and Hangover burgers  which I sampled  and they were just as tasty!

Excellent food! It was our first time eating here last night  We sat in the dining area  so I cannot comment on the bar  The server was nice and kept checking on us  and filled my tea before it was even half empty  The place was nice and clean and smelled great! Our food didnt take too long to come out  and we tried lots of seafood! Between the scallops  clams  mussels  oysters  and calamari  we couldnt decide what was best! This is our new favorite place  and will definitely be back with our whole family!! Whoever the cook was last night is an excellent chef! Thank you Shucks!,positive,1040143

This will def become a family favorite!,positive,342939
Foskoskies is the perfect place for a nice meal in the neighborhood   The staff is downright remarkable  and the kitchen does a great job of providing new twists on old standards  while still maintaining the traditional meals you expect   For example  they succeed in turning out Pomegranate glazed duck and still have time to make a great bbq pork wrap with a friend onion ring!  The staff is as warm as the 1950sstyle ambiance  I ordered the spicy Thai noodles and they helped me customize the spiciness!  One stop location for lunch  dinner  wine tasting  or a long evening on their quiet back patio Things to try: Country Delights like Fried Chicken dinner  MeatloafSpecials like Osso BuccoVegetarian dishes (those Thai noodles!)Be sure to leave room for the Brownie dessertQuaint  neighborhood charm with a staff that is eager to please and a skilled kitchen!  Definitely a place to become a regular at ,positive,1266967

I was very late from my appointment (more than half an hour!) but they accommodated me reorganizing their schedule  I was impressed how nice was everybody working together to solve the situation  I was expecting a shorter treatment time due to my late arrival but it was even more than an hour! Kyle  my therapist was very knowledgeable and easy to talk to  I have massages and foot reflexology massages on a regular basis but he was the best Ive ever had (especially if you like a strong one)  Not a fancy spa but neat and clean  Its a family run business and you will feel right away that they care I can hardly wait to return!,positive,2779692

Lago Italian Bakery          Seems to be the Sunday morning hangout after Sunday church  The smell of freshly baked breads and espresso coffee wakes up the senses  I go in the morning so as to get freshly cut  coldcuts and bread  The hot table looks delicious with an array of veal  sausages  peppers  pasta and meatballs  All home made  There is a small seating area and the vibe is friendly  While there is an array of pastries  Cakes are few  A selection of Italian pastas  canned tomatoes and olive oils are visible on their well stocked shelves  Very clean ,positive,3390970
My family has been going to this bakery for as long as I can remember and Im a bit confused with the low ratings!

I dont plan to abandon my top choice for durian cake anytime soon!,positive,3695405
The cutest little shop! I cant wait to go back an try other drinks and pastries  We went on a Saturday around midday and the place was empty  Plus  I think their drinks are reasonably priced for such a high end little bakery  I had a Vietnamese iced coffee with a hint of rose flavor  I could hardly taste the rose but thats what I get for trying to mix drinks   My drink came with complimentary cotton candy too!,positive,4816647
Evaluated and being treated during a several month process for Hypothyroid     starting with Dr  Amir Harari and continuing with NP Eryn Berry    they have given me the necessary attention to address my needs and thoroughly explain The process and condition to me in a time when doctors rush patients through so quickly these days you dont get that here!  when I go on the patient portal or contact by phone they are extremely communicative and the followthrough is great  the front counter is exceptional and the times move pretty quickly  I would highly recommend these two specific Professionals and specific location!!!,positive,992837
Go to this place if you have a major sweet tooth! The ice cream is freshly made at the shop which is a bonus  They have unique flavors like durian and black sesame! Also have some vegan options as well  You can make your own macaroon ice cream! Which I did! I had a weird but good combo which was green tea and red velvet macaroon with cookie dough ice cream! It was super good fulfilling :) I also got the durian ice cream which was great! The flavor is not a strong durian taste  it is not like durian boba  The workers were also helpful! I did not catch her name but she was super bubbly and nice! She apologized for the wait since it was busy which I understood its not her fault and she tried her best to accommodate everyone! She is the one with braces lol,positive,1335932
I ordered their yakisoba chicken bowl and it was yummy but the yakisoba was cold and it was definitely undercooked  I love my noodles al dente but they were definitely still undercooked by far   The flavor of the bowl was good and it was a good portion size too   The prices are ok but a little over priced in my opinion   I saw some other things on the menu that I would try and would definitely go back and check them out ,neutral,2516594
I had high hopes for this place   My waitress was dreadful and they werent that busy   I had to wait for a menu  coffee and to be served   She virtually ignored me   There was a lot of food   The corn beef hash was good   But only some of the food was hot   Please get milk or cream in little pitchers   Whatever brand of packaged creamers you use are not good and are hard to open   The waitress knew that I had creamer on the table  on me and on the seat trying to open the package   I dont know what is in those things but the creamer left a film on the table  the bench and me!  She didnt bring anymore napkins and didn t offer to help clean up the mess   The other waitress seemed nicer and checked up on her customers   I dont know if I will be back ,negative,2137687
This is the place to get cheap knick knacks from our neighbors to the South  and all without leaving the comforts of Scottsdale  where all minorities live in fear and humiliation!But seriously folks  From ceramic turtles to minis of Mezcal this place has everything  Yeah  you can travel down to Nogales and haggle with the locals who all want to sell you their sister  but if you cant make it down there  or dont want the hassle  this is the next best option Oldtown Scottsdale has a lot to offer as well  Park and explore other souvenir and Southwest Art shops and grab a bite to eat  Not the most exciting place in the world  but there are worse ,positive,5349943

We went here after several of my friends keep talking about it  I loved that you can get a sample of the wing flavor We had the ATL dry rub & Honey BBQ  Both were delicious and full of flavor  The fries are enough for 2 or more people to share  They had 3 options of Kool aid which is always a bonus with me  I have no complaints about this place  I just hope it stays this way  Good food & hood service,positive,6137067

See my review for Myst because much of that applies here  however  Axis/Radius is of course a little different    This is a bit more of a meet market than Myst and theres more space to dance if thats your thing  that doesnt mean theres more room    its actually more difficult to dance here because its more crowded on a busy night  This place has been around longer than most clubs in the valley and it has managed to keep somewhat busy  The fact that its been around for so long should demonstrate how solid it is  Im not a huge fan of clubbing and I dont even really like to go to Myst or Axis/Radius  however  I recognize that these places do a good job at what they do  I have even had a decent time at these clubs before  One of the benefits of going to one of these larger clubs is that the douchefactor is lower than at the smaller trendy clubs  The whos who are far too snobby to show their faces here  Youre also likely to meet someone from out of town here ,neutral,4397193

Probably the best hometown diner Ive eaten at in years  Breakfast was homemade and fresh  Seriously this was awesome and I know good food  French toast was spot on  Service was decent but the food was the star  Excellent sausage links with a side order of real home fries  Wish this place was close to home  Good price for what you get ,positive,4256861

The goat cheese app was my favorite of the evening    except maybe the Carrot Cake  The owners mother makes it  IT IS PERFECT  The entrees were   ok  nothing stellar  Salmon was good  but the risotto was   unexpectedly cheesy  crab cakes were crab cakes  the remoulade was good on them  their wine list is almost overwhelming  but i cant say that its a bad thing! will we be back? eh  maybe     ?,neutral,4897918
I really wanted to like this place  I had high expectations based on their previous reviews  My mom and I came in  I wanted gel mani and my mom got a fill  Mine was $40 which isnt too outnof the norm  but my moms fill was $38  Thats really high but they use a different product and gel instead of regular polish  They DO NOT do regular polish fills per the lady  Oh well were there so we proceed  My mani was ok but a day later I notice the girl didnt paint my whole nail  on three of the nails  And it seems like they have roses over the nail  For $40 it wasnt worth it and we wont be back again  This was by far the worst gel mani I have had ( lasting wise)  Also for $40 I expected to have a lot of colors to choose from but was sadly diaappo,negative,2562634
I was so hungry when we arrived!!! This cute girl w 2 puff balls in her hair took our order and she was super cutesy and nice  They brought our food to the table when it was done  It was hot!!!!

The Green Room is perhaps one of Torontos best kept secrets  Ive been going here for many years  and felt it was time to write a review for them Ive always found the service extremely friendly and pleasant  and usually also quite quick The menu is a mixture of Vietnamese/Asian/Pub food  in one of the best ways    You can come for a bacon and egg breakfast  Pad Thai  Sandwiches and fries  or even some mexican food   Perhaps my favourite dish  and not to be missed is the Green Room Special  a plate of glass noodles  with Shrimp  Chicken  Tofu  Egg and Stir Fried Vegetables  This has long been my favourite dinner spot out  and it will continue to be Not to mention  the drinks are very cheap! Half litre of house wine is only $12  and many mixed drinks start at $5 I would highly recommend this place  if you can find it   ,positive,4739259
DO NOT ORDER THE GUAC unless you want a very bland and tasteless guac  Theres nothing mexican about this guac  restaurant  and food  Ordered the rib eye taco platter  Meat quality and flavor were good  Definitely not more than a 3 star for this restaurant  If you want good and cheaper tacos go to tacos el gordo on the strip  Our server gets a 5 star though  He was awesome ,neutral,805989

Decided to give Niceys a try  We had the jerk chicken dinner  This is the first time Ive ordered this dish and NOT have to ask for hot sauce  May be too spicy for some but I liked it  While spicy  overall flavour was just ok  The real downside was the chicken meat itself which was dry and had the look and texture of yesterdays reheat   Proportions and price is on par or slightly higher than other jerk places Ive eaten at  Service is on the slow side for a take out only joint ,neutral,832724
The place is clean  the staff is friendly and the prices are quite reasonable However  this place is just average  Hidden behind Firehouse Subs  it is a great place for a casual  quick lunch  I order a cheeseburger with swiss  I was not asked what I wanted temperaturewise  They have several side options which include chips and various mayotype salads  I upgraded to fries  I was a little disappointed I did this  They were standard crinkle cut  Not very impressive  A lunch for two under $20 is probably standard  So try this place when you are looking for a simple burger or sandwich  I would definitely go back again for a quick bite ,neutral,4964845
We spent a great deal of time touring the Asian grocery store and finding some great items including fresh quail eggs that Ive looked for in Madison for years!!! It wasnt easy to find the restaurant we sought until we saw a hand written sign in English directing us BEST Chinese weve had in years!!! Fried rice  spicy pork and beef noodle bowl were ALL delicious  We would highly recommend ,positive,6101235
I was really not happy with the service at this place  My friend and me went last Friday for lunch we sat down and ordered our food and water   We were sitting for 20 minutes never got our water after 28 minutes we had to leave  We were on our lunch break and we just thought it would take more than 1 hr to get service since there were 4 other tables waiting for there food ,negative,2755417

Errrr  who came up with this concept???! AWsome! Unlimited toppings for one SMALL price  I kept waiting for the catch  But excuse me  there isnt one! My pizza was at the table in less than 5 minutes after I sat down  Granted  I couldnt decide on which fountain drink I wanted  had to choose condiments  a straw  napkins  dry pepper  cheese  etc  But all jokes aside  this place rocks! Go staff!    All 50 of you guys who were at the counter waiting to take orders and add toppings to that raw dough ,positive,991408
This branch has been pretty good for the most part until recently  I had an overdraft from amazon hitting my bank account twice  I currently dont live in Vegas  but I had my account set up here  so I figured I should just speak with my branch that has always just been there for me Boy was I wrong The lady that picked up the phone was rude and unhelpful  She told me I couldnt resolve my overdraft on my account through the phone and gave me a sarcastic reply that they have 180 branches nationwide and I can just go to any of them  In disbelief  I called the national Wells Fargo line  which professionally took care of business for me in a friendly manner Overall  I have to give them 2 stars for this recent rudeness  but beside that  they were pretty reliable for the most part ,negative,5167388
Hmmm   Dont know what to think   We had a sandwich and a quiche   Sandwich was  uh  interesting   Bread did not seem overly flavorful   Ingredients seemed to be quality but were very sparse   The thing I thought was so odd          humongous chunks of cold butter on the sandwich   Is that a French thing??  Reminded me of sandwiches my mom would make me as a kid  She always spread the bread with butter  no matter the kind of sandwich  but at least she used soft butter and SPREAD it evenly over the bread   Nothing wrong with the quiche  but Ive definitely had better   I was hoping this would be my new goto lunch spot  but thats looking like a big no ,negative,1747579
I had a nearly brand new laptop with a cracked screen  After researching parts  Cory gave me a quote over the phone  Then he came by and picked up the computer the next day  He was great at texting me uodates through the whole process  After a few days he delivered it back to me as good as new!Highly recommended!,positive,2116596

Amazing food! Great service! My family of 5 ordered 2 beef kabob plates and 2 shishkabob plates  So much food! I found it through yelp and so glad i did!,positive,276181
The first time we went the food was surprisingly good   I had the beef brisket and he had the ribs   The green tomatoes were excellent   I was glad that someone in that kitchen knew how to prepare Macaroni & Cheese the old fashion way like it should be made with eggs and cream   It is not considered Mac & Cheese unless it has eggs in it   I dont know why other restaurants serve Mac & Cheese like a box of Kraft   Mac & Cheese made and served that way is for people who do not know how to cook ,positive,4835376
Can a place be classy and white trash at the same time? I didnt think it possible until tonight  Fantastic burger  Great beer selection  Super nice people even if many were missing teeth Not being from Pittsburgh  I know nothing really about this neighborhood  But this place seems to sum it up nicely  Cool short and narrow row houses line the streets  Working class by the looks of it  And a great  cheap meal  What more could I ask for?,positive,698573
I cant believe this place is tucked in a strip mall with a Subway and a Frys!I came here at 8 a m   right when they opened their doors  on a weekday last week and there was already a line! The aroma was wafting out into the parking lot   yum!Scratch is really cute  fashionable with pink and black walls and cool vintage Vogue covers on the walls  The  pastries are great  The downside? Theyre really pricey  I think the almond croissants are $3 a pop  But they are heavenly  My husband is completely addicted to this place Their coffee is good  too  and its organic and fairtrade I tried their sandwiches last weekend  though  and wasnt impressed  They were just too expensive for what amounted to a (admittedly great) slice of bread and cheese  But Id like to try their quiche next time  Id definitely recommend coming to Scratch  just get here early  before they sell out of their croissants!,positive,1961064
Ana Maria altered and cleaned my mothers wedding dress so I can wear it to my wedding in Italy this June  it is absolutely beautiful  I was so nervous trusting someone to do alterations on this dress that is 30 years old and she did an incredible job  I couldnt thank her enough for putting back every decorative petal on the straps and ensuring that all the beading on the dress looked brand new  Thank you! Thank you!,positive,310880
This place is really not that good  Items on the menu dont list all of the ingredients so be careful if you have allergies  The sushi is honestly and truly just sub par  There isnt enough variety  rolls are small and you pay way too much for what you get  There are other options within a similar distance that are better quality and price  Staff is nice though  but the staff is also nice elsewhere ,negative,5504251

This office is wonderful! The staff and doctors are amazing they take the time to talk and explain  things to you  they worked with our limited budget and were always sensitive to our needs and concerns  My husband gets very anxious about his teeth and they were able to give him oral sedation that made the procedure easy on both of us  The office staff even fed me breakfast after we found out that due to the extensive damage of my husbands teeth the procedure was going to cause us to stay an extra couple of hours  I am so thankful for this place and the staff there!,positive,5382834
Terrible service!!!! Sat in the drive thru for 10 mins and I got no greet or hello yes the mic is working I just dont give a shit     when I pulled up to the window the female that was taking orders had earbuds in her ears was not taking orders    obviously no good management for that establishment ,negative,4698700

I was super excited to check out this new Cider House after visiting the one in Pittsburgh  Being celiac (glutenfree)  cider becomes a goto drink when out at bars   and Angry Orchard is widely available  but so sweet its hard to drink more than one or two beers  I was happy to find this cider house to have more taps for cider than beer  and mostly all Griffin Cider which is amazing! Not too sweet  variety of flavors    and the Burley Man XB makes Uber your friend  Atmosphere is cosy  but open  plus there is a back room for extra space on busy days  No food  but there is a nice taco place nearby  This will be my new goto when in town for Tribe games!,positive,2768860
My last stop at an eatery in Scottsdale during my trip and this was a great way to end it  Went for lunch and was not disappointed  Tons o options for hot and cold sandwiches plus salads and I think some wraps too  Im not sure simply because I stopped looking when I saw the Tina salad on walnut cranberry bread  And it was awesome  The sandwiches dont come with chips or anything like that  but they do come with a nice serving of deli pickle slices  Which were fresh and tasty!Tons and tons of beverage options and yummy baked goods which are also quite good Worth a stop for lunch (which can be quite busy) and I will try to get back here next time Im in town ,positive,3786753
Patrick did a wonderful job cleaning my carpet I am impressed I used a groupon but unlike others companies  they didnt do a crap job I certainly I will hire them again  Is worthy the price,positive,4180877
I was lucky to attend their soft opening last night   I had a great time and enjoyed the evening   They seat you at long tables and provide you with a palette and paint to complete a project   The staff are extremely helpful and friendly   The step by step demo and instructions make it very easy to complete a project  even if you are not a painter  Extra paint colors are available should you choose to vary from the exact project planned for your class   I decided to make a sunflower painting while the rest of the class painted a wine glass picture   Food and drink was provided for the event  but I do not know what is regularly included  All in all  it was very relaxing and fun    I browsed their upcoming class schedule and several offerings caught my eye   I think this is a great date night or a girls night out ,positive,2743351

I cannot recall service that was this bad  The young man that waited on my family was on his cell phone the entire time we were there   He was upset that we wanted to sit away from a large noisy table and never changed his attitude while we were there  TERRIBLE SERVICE!The food was average at best   The Pad Thai was flavorless and limp and other three dishes unremarkable/unmemorable   There are better (much better) options for Asian food near Ohio City Such a fall from grace   when the namesake restaurant was on Madison  it was the best Asian food in Cleveland   It moved to w130 and was still great  then a change of owners and now location and Phnom Penh has hit the bottom Do not waste you time  money or expectations   avoid,negative,1972604

This place did a phenomenal job on my vehicle  I also got a discount on gas  The attendant Cesar did beyond overthetop went out of his way to make sure my car was extra clean it was very very dirty from thousands of miles of travel  It is a contractor work truck it looks almost normal again  I would highly recommend this spot ,positive,5393009
Pretty good; nothing special but OK   Bread is a little better than Suways  but not as good as Quiznos   Filling such as meats and cheeses are of average quality and amounts  and may seem slightly less in quantity than some of the other places since their large sub is 12 inches   But with a discount coupon it is pretty good and I have no complaints ,neutral,4242557

We stopped in here for lunch on a Tuesday and the lunch special was pulled pork tacos which came with a pint of beer for only $10  and it was excellent!

After 4 months at David Bartons I have discovered this is without a doubt the best gym in Las Vegas   I have been a member of Golds  LVAC and Lifetime and none compete with the David Bartons   When you enter it looks like it may be a hipster or a little douchie but it is not any of these   The front desk staff are amazing   I deal with 4 different employees due to the different times I hit the gym   Each one is as friendly and helpful as the last   The equipment is great and the gym is never busy   Simply put this gym is great ,positive,175476

Beautiful Salon with Great Prices and Friendly Staff! Highly Recommended!My Maid of Honor and I went on my wedding day  It was the perfect relaxation needed before the big event  The stylists did a great job on our hair!!! It was pinned perfectly to hold up in Vegas heat for a June wedding  And I love the dry scent they added  Our hair looked and smelled great! They were very accommodating  And the salon space itself is beautiful  You can tell they care about detail  The place just makes your feel pretty and good!

I had street noodles #2 and really enjoyed it  My wife had the pad tai  We both shared our food and they offered to bring plates out  We brought our own bottle of red wine  Unfortunately we dud not have room for desert  but the choices sounded great  We both walked out with full bellies and two little togo boxes  Were definitely coming back ,positive,276432
I have been stalking this food truck for quite some time  Like other Yelpers mentioned  she is hard to track down at time  Not much notice on her IG page   and her opening at certain time is not always accurate! However  her dumplings are yummy   Theyre spicy but not spicy enough that they can kill you even tho it look like it   I have a chance to try the crab and chicken dumplings today  Wanted to try the ramen and pork buns but unfortunately it was sold out by time they took my order  Re: the crab and chicken dumplings  The texture (wrappers) hold up to the sauce very well  All combine nicely   does have a kick to it  I did have a peek at the beef ramen and the gentleman told me its spicy   I sure wish she would have a star by it to say its spicy or something  But overall my craving have been satisfied  If I can track her down again  I would love to try her pork buns and ramen!,positive,2221953

Perfect hotel  I wouldnt stay anywhere else   We had a Four Seasons Room with a view of the strip overlooking Luxor and a huge walk in closet (like a separate dressing room!)   Convenient to Mandalays casino without the noise and smoke of being in a casino hotel   The pool is great with misters and plenty of great staff to set you up with your chaise and bring you anything your hearts desire   There is also lots of shady spots to recline in too   The staff there are constantly replenishing your lemon water  cleaning sunglasses  bringing frozen melon balls on toothpicks  you name it!  Theyre so polite and helpful too   I cant imagine staying anywhere else  Ive been spoiled by the Four Seasons!,positive,4187317

We came at 1:30pm for a late lunch  When we were there  it was busy and we totally understood  so we quickly ordered and waited  waited  waited until kids were impatient  We noticed the table next to us had new guests and enjoyed their food already! So I went to talk to the waitress  Just wait  this their reply  Then our food was finally ready around 3pm!!! When the waitress took the food to us  she called the food in Korean name  of course we didnt know  So she was very rude with a large sound bang to put the food on table  Actually They deserve a zero star  since no one deserves such a service  not to say the only flavor you can taste there is Kimchi ,negative,5960642

Eating a meal at Heirloom was an absolute delight from start to finish  Their commitment to using local products is utilized in every aspect of the restaurant with great care  The service was fantastic  Our server was incredibly friendly  informative  and attentive  We ordered a bottle of red wine made in Asheville which was excellent and each LOVED what we ordered: the fried chicken  game ravioli  and fish with vegetables  We intentionally packaged up our meals with some room to spare so we could each enjoy a dessert masterpiece by Chef Ann  Chocolate cake with raspberry sauce and thin mint ice cream  apple cake  and carrot cake  We left very happy and excited for the following day when we could eat the leftovers! Next time I visit Charlotte Ill definitely be making my way here to enjoy another fantastic meal ,positive,972211
I thought I finally had found a decent Mexican restaurant in my new neighborhood but this place is seriously bland and makes me miss Mexican food in the mission  I tried the super burrito and my man had the soft tacos both were so mild with no real flavor  Maybe Ill try something else soon but for now Los Burritos  2 stars ,negative,2631487
on our Toronto visit  checked out the Old Distillery District and wanted to rest my tired feet   Mill Streets patio looked so inviting with their plush patio furniture and cozy fire pits  Great place to kick it and have a glass of wine or beer We were stuffed and did not get a chance to try their food so my rating is only based on the ambiance which was a pleasant surprise ,neutral,6619382
Today must have been a great day to order pizza from Dominos in Forest Hills  Usually I would have said  No Way but I needed something delivered and I knew Pizza Hut has let me down to many times with calling and they have no delivery person  I saw the new menu and thought I would give them a try  I ordered online  paid online and watched online as my pizza was being made  and when it would be delivered  I honestly expected and prepared for the worst ! What a huge pleasant surprise Hot fresh pizza delivers in 25 mins I was happy  the kids where happy all is GOOD !Give them a try I wasnt disappointed!!,positive,5683560
Best pita pit location by far  I eat pita pit on a regular basis and the staff here separates it from the rest  They are very consistent and friendly  they make sure everything is perfect by going above and beyond every single time  Its the same food as every other location but the staff makes this location the best  I go out of my way sometimes to go to this location vs another one ,positive,540600

The truth is I was heading to Professional Brake  which has 5 stars with 111 reviews on Yelp!  Unfortunately  they went on vacation  There was a sign on their door  pointing to ATS Auto and Truck Service  so I thought I might as well gave them a try  First impression was they were nice  They took a look at my brakes and told me my brake still good for another 50K miles  Not bad! :)Although they havent performed any service for me yet  I like their service  attitude and will definitely come back ,positive,5035514

Okay  this is your typical Phoenix short order Mexican joint as far as atmosphere goes  Hint: Dont be scared of the bars guarding the register and kitchen  honestly  I love the atmosphere of this place and have never seen sketchy people in there  The food is outstanding! The carne asada has crispy edges from being cooked on the plancha but its not dry at all and pack some great flavor  The tortillas are soft and fresh and the Pico is on point with the perfect amount of lime juice and perfect sized cuts  Also the tacos are outstanding and only 99 cents on Tuesday and Wednesday  This is my new go to spot for a quick and delicious bite  Do yourself a favor  skip Filibertos and come here for better food at better prices  Love it!,positive,4028095
Giving three stars because my girlfriend liked her Torta  I ordered the chicken enchiladas and found the chicken to be very dry (as if any juice was squeezed from the shredded chicken) and the sauce to be very bland  Enjoyable atmosphere  and decent service   Just not sure Ill be back ,neutral,1329948
Labelled as one of Torontos largest and most eccentric fashion collections  FX Boutique is always living up to this reputation With collections from LA  the European flare of Paris and the bright lights of NYC  this store is bursting with tons of clothes  both new and vintage  to the point that you could get lost for hours while skimming the racks and trying on several party dresses One thing that is great about FX is the unique and oneofakind pieces they offer to their customers  This means you will never have to worry about showing up to the party and spotting another guest wearing your outfit Prices do vary at this store  Some of the fashions are on the pricey end  but they always have great sales and amazing prices on their vintage or vintagetype items ,positive,3389902

Worst experience  ever and the manager Drake did not care to make things right  I called after the whole ordeal to request a refund for the beers they had served us and didnt allow us to drink  He just hung up on me   twice   We were discriminated and accused of something we didnt do in the womens bathroom when all we did was go search for my sisters phone  They will not be in business for long!!,negative,27159
The food is always ok   like since we are in the area  might as well go here  ok   i like to make my own dish and our waitress was soooo sweet and let me have noodles with broth  but the veggies cooked on the grill   It was great!   had a soup with noodles and some veggies I threw in  and some grilled veg!Good place to pop in if you are in the area not really a destination ,neutral,4852976
Wonderful dining experience I was introduced to Giancarlo through a business associate who arranged for dinner there one night  We sat on the patio on a wonderful summer evening and enjoyed wonderful pasta (lemon fettuccine) and wine  The service was perfect  the food was well prepared and overall it was a great dining experience  Recently I returned again for a business dinner and had a similarly fantastic experience: amazing carpaccio  osso bucco to die for and a wonderful brule risotto dessert  Service again was attentive and friendly  Atmosphere is warm and inviting  beautifully decorated and spotless Giancarlo is a great restaurant  Highly recommended   I will return ,positive,6417408
One of the best sushi restaurants Ive been fortunate to go to  Brilliant presentation   Quaint space below the fabulous Dantes  Fish is so dam fresh  Plenty to choose from on the menu with great Sake options  Sit at the Sushi bar if you do not have a RSVP  but come prepared to spend $$$  Its not cheap  its not expensive   but you see and want more because of how its prepared  Chin chin   ,positive,4077318

Could it be that the hype added to the disappointment? Ive heard many comparisons between Shake Shack and other burger chains and I was finally able to try it  A quick scan through Yelp found that a lot of people ordered the shack stack burger ($9 95) which is a burger with a shroom burger (like a fried mushroom with melted cheese) I thought it was pretty good; the gooeyness of the cheese was really good in the burger and the mushroom had a nice unique taste  The fries were    meh  Ive never been a fan of crinkle cut fries and they werent the crispiest either Overall it was kind of just an expensive burger thats not that big  At first try I would prefer In N Out but there is a Shake Shack opening close to me soon so I might have to give it another couple tries before I really say I like one over the other ,neutral,778331
I was able to get tickets to see Absinthe on a sold out night at a very reasonable price  Such a fantastic show  LasVegasTickets didnt disappoint!

Seriously  you guys  The drs and PAs we have seen here  including Dr Udall  have been really great  We have been seen for possible fracture of wrist  also textneck and slight scoliosis  Both Dr Udall and Dr Goggins we have seen  and their PAs  and they are great  They also have Spanishspeakers if needed  which we did need FYI depending on your time of your appointment  you might have to wait a while in the huge waiting room  Thats the only downside  They do have a movie playing for the kids  Or the adults who want to watch kid movies ,positive,4405836
Ive been here many times during the week and ive always gotten fast service  Occasionally you have to wait a few minutes  but you can see that the employees busy their butt to fill your order  Id always have to recommend the Caribbean Passion and a blueberry muffin  Great morning starts ,positive,3000474
In all honesty  I was very surprised how this place turned out  I didnt expect much because the restaurant here before was god awful  we never came back  We saw the reviews for this place and decided to give it a shot  and wow!

How about this: Ron showed up on time; did a great job; did not try to upsell; charged as he quoted! absolutely refreshing and welcomed a straight shooter after I had called 5 other plumbers: One did not show up; another I received quotes from two different guys from the same company with one wanting to charge $200 more than the other guy (Legendary Plumbing); another wanted to upsell a pipe cleaning for $300 more and they advertised on TV as a Reputable Plumbing and A/C company (Parker & Sons)   John,positive,1786390
The owner Ashwin is both abusive to customers and also rude to employees  I went in once to try this place out after eating at pita jungle and noticed right away the store owner yelling at the employees about how she does everything wrong and will not receive her tips this month  I was upset off the bat but got some yogurt and asked for samples I got 5 for it being my first time and as I was getting them ashwin the owner kept staring at me and the girl working told me be careful he charges 10 cents per sample so heating that I went to see if it was true and I took the amount I got and timesed it by the price per ounce and it was 50 cents too much  I complained and he said Im a liar and very mistaken and said just leave  So I left and never would recommend this place to anyone  Go to menchies!,negative,4949075
I just found this little restaurant in Newmarket   The place is small but very cozy   I love Spanish guitar and Emilio did not disappoint   The food was great   Carlo  the server was great from the time I called   He was friendly  he knew the menu inside out and had good knowledge of the wine list (very important to me)   I really enjoy the experience with my lovely wife   I will recommend this place to all my friends ,positive,2319203
this chains a godsend to travelers who need quick  reasonablypriced    healthy/nongreasy eats  i ate lunch here everyday while staying at Caesars Palace   perfect business model  always nice employees   i dig their brown rice option (which is hard to find in restaurants) healthy & delicious   love my nofrills chicken burrito for $7 08,positive,6641769
Not so typical bulk froyo place   The yogurt itself is a very good quality (about 10 vanities   try the salted caramel) but its the toppings bar that earns it a full 5 stars  Ive never seen anything like it  From fruits to nuts to candy to toasted coconut to Yodels  Yes   I said it  Yodels  Yum!,positive,3941922

By far   the best lunch I have EVER had in Vegas  I go to Vegas at least annually  Just found this place on Yelp  and decided to try it  Way to go Yelpers!! I had the lunch special which consisted of the tomato salad  grilled bass  and Greek yogurt with strawberry puree  I wish this place was in California  The tomato salad was super fresh  and had GREAT flavor  I am not a fan of tomatoes or salads  but this was a showstopper  The bass was cooked perfectly and the addition of the capers made it utterly delectable  The Greek yogurt was the best quality yogurt I have ever had  I typically do not eat strawberries (I know I am a weirdo like that)  and I was scraping the glass to the last drop  I would have licked it clean   it was THAT good ,positive,619043
Our waiter  John  was great  There were plenty of reservation options available for dinner on Saturday night through Opentable com  I started with a Cosmopolitan that tasted like a delicious  sweet candy concoction  John brought us some warm garlic knots that were soft little pillows of heaven  You could also dip them in olive oil and balsamic that were brought to the table  I ordered the pssta fagioli soup  It was hot and hearty  I appreciate when food is served hot    I then tucked into a bowl of pasta carbonara  The pasta was a little thicker than I prefer but cooked just right and the sauce was spot on  My dining companion enjoyed a white sangria thst was visually appealing with beautiful fruit followed by lobster ravioli  Needless to say  there were no leftovers  A great dinner option while in Vegas!,positive,4142839
Negative 5 stars if I could went here with a friend and waitress told me we couldnt be served because they are closing I  I told them you guys are open till 12 she said your wrong lost a customer and I will never come here again,negative,3853616

Contrary to their website and my hotels staff  their Latenight HH does not start until 11pm!!!  Dont be tricked like I was tonight   The food is not worth the price I had to pay   I found the bartender to be a bit condescending  too   Call me a prude or whatever but at almost 40 years of age  I prefer not to be called darlin every time the bartender addressed me   The first couple of times was cute but after that  UGH!  It was a slow night and I was one of only a handful of customers   I was addressed a LOT!!!,negative,768383
This is my favorite Mexican restaurant in the area  My orders have always been correct  My servers and host have always been extremely kind and efficient  I was a little surprised to read that someone called this Americanized Mexican food  Maybe it depends what you order but that has never been my experience  My exspouse is literally from Mexico and he was pleased with his food  And hes very critical of Mexican food and difficult to please! He said it was authentic  I personally would trust a true Native Mexicans opinion over a foodie on Yelp  (No offense ) I really enjoy the food and the atmosphere  and I have zero complaints  Keep up the great service  El Meson!,positive,5274276

We went there for the first time with family  table of 10   I called the the day before when I made the reservations that dishes had no msg and menus were not fixed  They confirmed it with me  When we went  it was fixed menu only  Very disappointed   We stayed anyways  dishes had no msg and were not salty  They were very good  We ordered a scallop dish but when it came out  it had no scallops  When we pointed it out to them  They said they would redo it  They never did  we waited another 2030 mins and when we asked about it again  They yelled it us (manager and the owner) asked us why we ate it anyways   They just shrugged their shoulders and handed us the bill  It was very poorly handled on their part  We never got a dessert either  We will not going their again ,negative,6146278
Found this gem on Groupon and its amazing! The salon is adorable and welcoming and Sophie is so friendly and easy to talk to  A few days after I got my hair cut  I wasnt 100% happy with the style and I asked her if she would be willing to make a few changes  She was so nice about it and made sure to get me back in ASAP  I went back tonight and couldnt be happier! I will definitely be back and would recommend this place to anyone looking for a reasonable place that isnt your typical Scottsdale  salon ,positive,1270292

Sushisamba is cute restaurant in Palazzo  The food was good however I expect more flavor  We ordered the following and here are my rankings:Shrimp ceviche: (4 5/5) needed more of zing  It had passion fruit juice and mangos but something to balance the tang wouldve been great  Samba strip: (4 5/5) amazing but a bit of spice would take it to the next level Handrolls: (3 5/5) it was good but missing flavor Beef wagyu: (2/5) didnt think it was great  Overall the restaurant was good but I wouldnt return ,positive,4664123
You know its good when youre some of the few non Asians in the place  I prefer this place to their competitor Vietnam grille    The Vietnamese coffee is great the yellow pancake is great the fish is great       Actually Ive never had a bad dish here ever   Prices arent bad either  Go ,positive,6525652

Plum is a great option if you want sushi and prefer a more upscale atmosphere  Sky is an excellent sushi chef  and try to sit at the sushi bar so you can watch his work  All the fish is very fresh and beautifully prepared  There is a small and nice bar area with a TV  and the restaurant is very nicely decorated  I adore the plum/lychee martini!,positive,4219362
went here today with the family  the food was good the service was decent and the portions are large   I had the prime rib  which came with fresh veggies  and mashed potatoes  and a salad  and it was quite satisfying  another person in our group had the turkey dinner which again was good but a bit salty for her taste  and the last person in our group had the roast beef au jus which was a bit towards the average side   The garlic bread that was brought to the table was hot and fresh  and the salads were good also   All said its a decent place for a group of people but the crowd here is generally older   Its across from a seniors home and they seem to like this place a whole lot   You dont leave hungry  thats for sure,neutral,6659327
THE BUFFET in Las VegasParty of 4 was about $90  Walking in  the decorations were very nice  Overall very pretty  is it strange that Im commenting on this? Anyways  We arrived at around 3 or 4  Our plan was to eat til the dinner food started coming out  The food selection here was THE BEST  and everything tasted fresh and clean  from left to right was seafood  asian food  american food  pasta  i forgot   and then salad bar! and the desert place  ice cream (i actually think it was gelato) and all sorts of yummy things  i personally thought their creme brulee was the best ive tasted in vegas!,positive,4669957

So good! Foie gras ravioli wasnt cooked enough for me but the flavor was amazing  That fact that isnt want cooked all the way and the time between the starter and the main course were the only downsides  The food is amazing  Service is amazing  10oz filet was cooked perfectly  Risotto was sooooo rich and the dish was a good size portion  Would recommend only one side for two people  The cauliflower was the best Ive ever had  Definitely will be coming back  Better than when we had dinner at Cut in Beverly Hills and less expensive  Well worth the money ,positive,4501001
Secretly mediocre  Ive grew up eating pizza from New York and the tristate area  as well as from Chicago so my taste bud is a little bit spoiled I solely came here because of the hypes and I left very disappointed  The pizza is a step above frozen pizza  but honestly lack flavors when compare to DiGiorno  I came here during the less busy hours and ordered a slice of Sicilian and pepperoni  The food came ready in about 5 minutes so the waiting time wasnt so bad  I really didnt care for either of these pizza  they were bland  crust was okay nothing to write home about and the sauce was ehhhh   canned tomatoes  I guess if youre from LA youll think their pizza is the best thing since sliced bread but for New Yorkers and Chicagoans  save your money elsewhere  unless youre drunk and needed some greasy food to sober up ,negative,4396763
Usually pretty prompt service when delivered to my work place for a large order (we tip well)   Ordered last night to home and it took 2 hours   I called to inquire  woman was very apologetic and said they were busy   Driver very apologetic also   Food was hot and deliciois,neutral,5788312

These Place blew my mind last week  I havent been so impressed with food before that a week later I talk about it  Seafood the likes of which I have never tasted  But then the bartender Alan did things with whiskey that changed me on a spiritual level  I walked out of there wondering why this guru mixologist left whatever mountain top sanctuary and lowered himself among us mortals  Thanks to him and the chef I will return to Vegas quickly  Cheers,positive,5087963

On Friday afternoon we arrived at California pizza kitchen in Summerlin about 3 PM when someone finally acknowledged our presence and we got a table outside after we set down it was at least 20 minutes before someone asked us for a drink   The waitress that asked us if we wanted a drink her hygiene was definitely a one star   The whole Staff was unprofessional  From the tattoos to the saggy pants   We will Never return to this location we were really appalled at our whole experience at California pizza kitchen  This was probably the worst service we have experienced  I am a Las Vegas native and I will share my dining experience with my family and friends   Thank You,negative,4038290

Great place and so convenient   We were searching for a pottery place that opened earlier than 12  this is the only one we found! The girl there was helpful and attentive  continually asking us if we need anything and helping other families with handprints and designs for gifts   We picked our pieces and the routine was quite easy   Big selection of paint colors  paint brushes  stencils and design ideas   But hey when you are a kid you pick your piece  you do what you want to it! oh and you also pick what piece mommy is doing too! The place is clean  has a bathroom if needed  and has coffee and water   There is a nice selection of pieces  even for the holidays from plates/bowls  to character statues  piggy banks and mugs   The only reason not five stars is the prices are high for a kids activity   If your child wants to do more than one piece or go often this adds up!,positive,1530036
Recently opened in Vegas it was hard to get a dinner reservation during our stay so we opted for lunch and it was probably the best meal we had in Vegas!

This was my first time to try this place  I have driven by so many times and never had the urge to try until one late night I was supposed to grab a cuppa joe from Tims across  I saw the well lit busy tea place and decided that tonights the night  The place was packed considering it was 11:30 in the evening  It was spacious and has a nice decor  I ordered taro milk tea with tapioca and passion fruit jelly  They have appetizer specials each day and I ordered the crispy shrimps  I also tried the pork siu mai  The milk tea was ok  ive had better  The shrimps were good  but i wasnt crazy about the siu mai as the dumpling wrappers were so thick and had an aftertaste  I would want to try out other things as they have quite a selection from the menu ,neutral,5634516
The first thing that I noticed about 0109 Dessert & Chocolate was that it was so homey and cozy inside   It smelled deliciously of chocolate throughout the shop and the warm interior reminded me of Christmas   This was a great place for a romantic dessert date or holiday celebrations   I really loved the atmosphere in there The Lava Cake was intensely rich with chocolate inside and outside   The chocolate lava that spilled out was so dense and decadent!  I needed help finishing it since it was so rich   The chocolate gelato was also very rich and smooth; it actually had chunks of chocolate in it!  A total chocolate overload ,positive,4831897
I have been here three times with my friends since it open  Good variety of soup bases and dipping sauce to choose from  I am not a big fan of Sichuan hotpot  So  the level of spicy is perfect for me  I believe the atmosphere is one of the best in Vegas Chinese restaurant  They have everything I want: vegetables  variety of mushrooms and torus  shrimp  crawfish  clam  fish/beef ball  seaweed salad and so much more  The only thing I am concerning about is the bowl is a little small and the place is little hard to find it when I first time come to here  I would recommended this place to my friends and love to come back ,positive,2214975
I usually never give low stars but couldnt finish my meal  I got the Koko  chicken on a biscuit  with a chipotle ranch  The biscuit was wayyy to salty  I normally love salty food but I couldnt eat this  It also made me sick to my stomach  Giving it stars because my boyfriend loves to eat here goes at least twice a month  So maybe I picked the wrong menu item  but in my opinion everything should be quality  Additionally the price was $11! No sides or anything  just a biscuit with chicken and a chipotle ranch with a tomato and some greens on it  I will most likely give it another try and will update my review if it improves ,negative,2677113

Im only giving it a star because I have to  I walked in and wasnt greeted for a few minutes while the lady with the middle aged cougar flirted with her younger co workers then when I was greeted I ordered a Venti hot coffee with ice just to bring it to room temp  She got the cup put it to the side and walked away telling her co worker what it was not labeling the cup while he was not really paying attention because he was in a conversation with another co worker  Then I asked for my coffee close to 10 minutes later and finally got it but with an attitude and half hearted apology  Forget that place ,negative,2942671

Food is fresh and exquisite  and they have vegan options!  The homemade mushroom crepes are absolutely delicious  they are garnished with sour cream but you can ask and they will serve them without it  We also tried their potatoonion Russian dumplings  very good as well   They have a mushroom sandwich and some great salads that we will be trying next time  It is hard to find places with authentic  fresh and homemade food   but this place has them all and the prices are great!  The Russian beers were also very good  we tried the number 3 and number 9 loger  the first one was my favorite  The place is new  nice and clean  The owner is an interesting cool guy and we enjoyed talking to him very much! We want to come back soon and bring friends to experience an exotic and authentic night out!  They have live Russian music on Fridays and Saturdays ,positive,1205957
I came here for lunch with a few friends and we honestly were not impressed  The food was not that great  We ordered off of the lunch menu  I ordered a prosciutto sandwich and a lobster bisque soup  The sandwich did not have any prosciutto on it and was mostly slimy cheese and the soup was extremely salty and I think there was a hair in it  A friend of mine is vegan and ordered a plain salad with just vegetables in it and they charged her $20 for it  She brought it up to the waitress and she said it was because it was a modified salmon salad    But she didnt have salmon in it which is the most expensive part  We also waited 40 minutes for our food and it wasnt even right  It came with items she didnt ask for and it took an additional ten minutes for the waitress to bring her side of salad dressing  Its a shame that the food isnt great because the place is really nice and has patio seating ,negative,1929713
The drinks were a little on the high side but the live band that they had was pretty good  The food menu could offer some more choices ,neutral,4822773
I LOVE THIS PLACE      they have the freshest food there  I ordered the chicken pesto sandwich with fresh mozzarella  and when is say fresh i mean fresh and the wine selections are out of this world  The prices are reasonable and the staff really know what they are doing  In my opinion its something that you would think to find in a strip mall       I will be a repeat customer,positive,1806624
Have to give a big shout out to Dale and the Cookies by Design store in Scottsdale  For my daughters birthday I wanted to surprise her with a cookie bouquet  I was in Illinois for work and ordered the arrangement on a Monday night  Her birthday was on a Wednesday but she had summer school and leaves the house at noon   I wanted to make sure someone was home for the delivery and spoke to Dale on the phone  Normally they schedule their deliveries in the morning but when I told him of my situation  he assurred me that the arrangement would be delivered before noon on Wednesday   Not only was it delivered by 10:00 AM  Dale himself made the delivery  Daughter was ecstatic  dad was happy and Dale kept his word  Have actually ordered from them several times in the past and will continue to do so  Thanks Dale for making my daughter extremely happy!,positive,1708200
This Chinese restaurant owner is from Hawaii  so a lot of the Chinese flavor still tastes like its from Hawaii  When I go here I ALWAYS have to have their Hawaiian crispy Gau Ghee  They always serve cold Ginger Chicken  Their Managua is ok  not like Libbys Manapua in Hawaii though  Eating here gives you that little bit of feeling like youre back home ,positive,5151340
Went to FTF last night and we will be going back   Live music and great variety   We could not even try them all   JJs  had the #1 and Charheel   Both of their staples    The #1 had some spice to it with the chili relish and crisp pickle gave it a nice crunch   The Charheel was delicious as well with chili  slaw  mustard and onions!Vitos  had the individual cheese pie   Good NY stlye pizza   Robust tomato sauce and the right amount of cheese    The crust was also crispy and had good flavor Rock the Mac  got the traditional mac and cheese   It was very cheesy   Next time i will branch out and add some stuff to it Italian ice from the Philly trailer was also good   I got the lemon   It was cool and the perfect ending to a great variety meal   Overall was very pleased with the event   Cant wait to go back and try the others!,positive,6274436
Tried my first poutine! Exactly what it says fries  gravy and bland little cheese balls  I think the rendition was good but the sentimental taste is better than it actually is   Burger was average but on a nice roll  Street watching priceless!,neutral,5720495
As a priority advantage customer  it was time to have the furnace checked   I was given a twohour window and a guarantee that I would be called 3045 minutes ahead of the visit   Right on time  Julian phoned to let me know that he was about 45 minutes out   Julian was respectful of me and my time  was extremely friendly and knowledgeable about my systems  and didnt try to upsell me  My experience with Julian is one of the reasons why I am a Morris Jenkins priority customer!,positive,345221
Went here for dinner and was very disappointed  Server was polite  no complaint on service  Ordered the  Fettucine Carraba with gluten free pasta  Pasta was undercooked and the sauce was extremely bland  Chicken was okay but kind of dry even with the light  bland sauce  Caesar salad with the meal seemed like t was out of the bag and had too much dressing  Would not recommend  2 out of 5 because wine was good and server was polite ,negative,6230974
I love this store but they need more out the valley they only have one in Las Vegas why is that  Need More,positive,2459777

Giadas restaurant is truly a party in your mouth  My son took me there tonight for my birthday   It was a great dining  experience   Cant  wait to go back  Our server Valentino was awesome  really took care of us   Had the tray of antipasto   rigatoni bolognese  pea tortelloni  lobster ravioli  entrees I had the veal saltimbocca  All were delightful   Would definately recommend it and will be coming back again being my son works there ,positive,1326198

Taste is great but tends to be really oily  Its also kind of expensive in my experience  The portions are not big enough to justify the price  That being said  I will continue to visit this restaurant because the flavours are quite food  and the service is great ,neutral,4684367
my wife and I stop at this store this afternoon  on 102618 she got a large drink and I ordered a large coffee  she had to ask for a lid for her drink I had to ask for my coffee no lids to fit a large drink got out  to theI  car went to drink my coffee and it was cold this place has really gone down hill when I lived in the area years ago it was great but now I will not stop here again ,negative,6614133
I dont come here on busy weekend nights so Im not sure for the atmosphere but its old town scottsdale  and a bar so Im not sure what peoples expectation is   I went here on weekday dinner and Friday early happy hour ( their half off app is amazing deal :))  And it was not loud at all  just enough :D   Service is always super friendly and everyone there always checks up on us  I guess it probably gets packed on the weekend so maybe service isnt as great but Im sure you arent expecting 5 star full course French meal service at a scottsdale bar on busy nights   Food is just so great! Love their prezles buns and their tater tots and onion rings  its not soaked in oil like most place   So if you do enjoy yummy burgers check this place out and if you dont like bar crowd  just go here on weekdays or lunch !,positive,2011422
This place was fun!  Clean  nice staff   I didnt like their odds at the craps table but aside that Ill be back,positive,5552412
Very cool! Will probably not appeal to those who dont have a particular interest in the ships tragedy  Many beautiful artifacts and an actual piece of the ship  My complaint is this was pretty expensive given the size of this exhibit  My boyfriend and I stopped and read/looked at everything and it still only took us an hour to get through even with our lingering  Also  I practically froze to death the entire time we were in there   to the point where I was flat out miserable  Bring a jacket!,positive,5806503

I found this hotel though groupon   For a really price   I totally fell in love with this place the room I had was really nice with a tub   Great customer service  If I ever need a room rumors would be my first choices  ,positive,2066837
Came here looking for something sit down and a bit nicer as we were staying at the Downtown Grand  Both the ambiance and the food was just okay to me  Service was great  we had a nice view of the pool and tank  but I found the food at Maggianos better and probably cheaper too! We had the prosciutto wrapped sea bass over veggies/potato  the veggies were really good  I think my husband had the mistake of of asking for his fish more well done than seared coz then the prosciutto was over done (and kinda tasted burned/fuel) and did no justice to the fish  I just had crispy risotto and meatballs  Both were good but nothing to write home about or something I couldnt make myself  The service really makes this place stand out  With so many places to try in Vegas  I dont think Id come back here anytime soon but it is a safe choice if youre pressed for time and are in the hotel ,neutral,662743
The service was a bit abrupt/clipped  but the fried rice was amazing!  Great location  small/intimate but very fast service!  Soda comes in a can rather than from a fountain   Overall was very impressed with a restaurant we decided to visit on the fly ,positive,5001566

Really nice hookah lounge  good hookah  good not loud music  friendly atmosphere  I recommend to come here,positive,4315862
It is unfortunate that I even have to give this place 1 star because they deserve zero  Hands down worst service I have ever received  We had to not only get up and ask for a server  but we also had to get up and ask for the bill  We were never checked on  nor were there any apologies  I have been to other locations and they were outstanding  however this location changed my over all opinion on Hickory Tavern ,negative,3213179
I refuse to go here ever  The service is slow no matter when you go   They dont have a good drink menu  Ive seen more stuff on the menu at the Starbucks in Target and Malls  And another note  one of the girls I roomed with in college (Taylar) currently works there  Since finding out she works there I will never go back  She does not take showers for months nor had she ever washed her uniform (4 months)  She doesnt watch her hands ever  She also talked massive dirty on her regulars and other customers  Probably not the best person to have working at a place that serves food to the public ,negative,2579473
Today I was at the Kosher Sobeys in Thornhill I do this once a year every year around Passover The selection of kosher for Passover foods that are also gluten free is quite significant This was one of our main stops to load up on gluten free treats years ago until gluten free before came more commonplace I picked up dark chocolate covered nuts  dairy free candies  and some specialty chocolates for my wife and teen A very large selection of product and caters to both the observant and the gentile  such as myself Friendly store  good hours  and lots of good and varied product ,positive,5682161

This is one of my goto sushi places in the Annex  Portions are substantial  prices are incredibly fair  and they get the food out to you quickly!The ambiance of the restaurant is like any other sushi restaurant in the area  nothing overly memorable but you dont come to Sushi in Bloor for that!I have tried many things of their menu and all are good portions and fair price: for appetizers  seaweed salad is a must  Mains: salmon or chicken teriyaki bento box; maki: dynamite roll  rainbow dragon roll  spicy tuna or salmon (you can ask for it crunchy and theyll at tempura bits)  university roll  and honour roll are all good; their udon is also delicious  Youll need a reservation if youre planning on going between 68 PM any day of the week  unless you dont mind waiting 1530 minutes  Japan Sushi and One Generation sushi nearby are comparable gotos!,positive,5305262

My Fiance and I took the tour of the Grand Canyon on 10/15/08   It was an incredible experience from beginning to end   The staff of Sundance was very professional  They called a couple days before the tour to reconfirm our pick up point and time   The limo was absolutely beautiful and the driver was excellent   He even offered to take our picture next to the limo   The pilot was outstanding   He could not have been a better guide   Headphones in the aircraft provided music which made it even more majestic as we flew over the mountains of hills headed for the canyon   He fielded questions from us all and took us to a beautiful spot where we landed and had our champagne lunch   I would highly reccommend this trip to anyone that wants to see the canyon   It was topped off by a flight down the strip   I will always treasure the pictures and video I got that day ,positive,3647995
I agree Sisters isnt as good as it once was as it now has new owners  We went once for dinner a few months ago and were really disappointed   The food wasnt really fresh and it definetly isnt as busy as it once was   We were married in Millies House which is now unfortunately gone  As it was our wedding anniverary weekend we decided to go back and this time the parking lot was full  someone was having a big party so at least the food was moving and the brunch buffet was fair  Id prefer to go to Teds for breakfast,negative,1827000

I am truly surprised right now! After 15 years of living across the street and eating here maybe 5 times because the food sucked so bad   I just had an awesome banquet burger! $14 The menu is not too vast  the prices are a bit pricey   But I will say that meal was worth the $14  I just told my lovely server and she said the got a new chef  I said keep him  She said the pizzas are really good too  Its been 4 years since Ive eaten here! At least I have the burger to look forward to now ,positive,1883763
Kenneth Cole at The Venetian is by far the best Kenneth Cole in Vegas  Other than the selection  Kenneth Cole at the Venetian has the best sales  Holiday season sales started last week and practically everything in the store is on sale  Downstairs sale ranges from 3040% off  Upstairs everything is 50% off its lowest marked price  Kenneth Cole at the Venetian also has great and friendly service  Definitely some great finds at this location ,positive,3368323

Great restaurant highly recommended definitely one of my favorite Italian restaurants in Phoenix  I came here for a birthday and they even brought out dessert on the house  Service was great  the waiting staff is very accommodating  nice and professional The food is phenomenal I really enjoy coming here every time for dinner or for lunch  Love this place  The plus of this place is that you can use Open table app for a reservation as well as the app here for the reservation  Try the Mafaldine pasta and the Arancini Risotto Balls  they are one of a kind  Let me also say that they are the only place in town that know how to make a real Prosciutto pizza  and add the freshly sliced Prosciutto after they cook the pizza  This place is highly recommended and those are some of the reasons for the recommendation ,positive,1561207
2 stars  Meh  I have had better (to be fair Im middle eastern)  I ordered the Jerusalem pita (chicken hearts and liver)  It took 10 minutes to prepare but it was well worth it knowing that the meat was being prepared fresh  It tasted OK but maybe I should have just ordered chicken shawarma or falafel instead  Toppings were what you expect at a middle eastern restaurant (fried eggplants were good)  Pita wrapping was alright but not up to par Overall I wouldnt mind grabbing some to go when Im hungry and in the area but its surely not the place I will go to when Im craving middle eastern food ,negative,37418
its just okay  the tacos arent the best  the corn is good (spicy)  The day we went it was really loud so it was hard to have a conversation  Service was alright  and the food came quickly  I wouldnt think I would go back  ,neutral,6604310
I was craving something cold and sweet   At first  I thought JJ but fortunately remembered Angel Sweet   Although one of their displays was broken  which meant not as many flavors were available  the options were still plentiful to me   My fav is the Fruits of the Forest   No dairy products for me so I love all their fruit gelato (which is dairy free)   I should not forget to mention that the gelato is delish  very creamy and tasty   Now that the temperature has warmed up (sarcasm)  Angel Sweet will be on my list of places to stop when Im out running errands ,positive,2712953

The service provided by their staff was topnotch    especially Danika Skinner and Ron  Danika greeted and helped me through my request  while Ron was quick to fix a broken wrist watch for my elderly father while he waited  I was so impressed how they both went out of their way to ensure we were taken care of  Excellent service and team I highly recommend!,positive,5633709
I moved here from California and was bummed because I had the assumption I would no longer be able to get good sushi in the desert (whether my assumption was correct or not its just how I felt :P)  But then my father took me to pure tonight and my sushi doom was over! Its just as good  if not better than any fancy sushi place Ive ever been too  If you know good sushi then this place is definitely worth going too  If its a little bit of a drive for you its still worth it  Service was great  our sushi chef was really good and made sure we were well taken care of  All these great reviews cant be wrong right!,positive,2480273
I am staying here on a business trip right now  I was initially put off by the obviously very old hotel  however theyve made up for it by having clean rooms  updated decor  friendly staff and an awesome happy hour and continental breakfast  The complimentary breakfast is cooked to order so you may as well be at a restaurant with all that you can order  Happy hour at Squaws Peak Cafe  the only room on the fifth floor  is free bud light and shock top on tap as well as a few select wines  pretzels  fruit and Rice Krispie treats  The staff has all been professional  friendly and super helpful  Our business meetings are taking place here and they have been more than accommodating in making sure everything goes off smoothly  They have also arranged dinner reservations and transportation for us at off site locations Recommend :),positive,1881307

This venue is a great size for more intimate musical acts  On the negative  parking is no longer free and ranges from $20 VIP (read not far away) to $5 lots (dont wear your heels cause yer gonna walk)  On the positive  we were upgraded to regular seats from lawn at no charge since we got there early  Thats a nice touch  The way it is arranged  I dont think there is a bad seat in the place  There are also places to get beer  water  wine and food  Yes  its overpriced but you are a captive audience  No different than any concert or sports venue I would also say that the acoustics for an outdoor venue are very good  I have been to many of these amphitheaters and all you hear sometimes are muddy echoes  Props to whoever was running the board because everything sounded great  You are there for the music after all  yes?,positive,5612086

Service here is impeccable  the gorgeous girls are always beaming with huge smiles as they serve u giant slices of pie!

Couldnt believe this place  Unless you are willing to pay 15x prices ($500 for Jack Daniels) then no seating or waitress service for you!  Very crowded without tables and constantly jostled by aggressive bouncers and hustling waiters delivering drinks   Extremely poor way to treat people Comparing this to the Wynn nightclub ,negative,779365

Pros: No problem finding a place to sit at the bar   Good temperature   Well lit   Nice family patriarch said thanks and slapped me on the shoulder when I held the door for them to leave  so nice clientele  Cons: Had the Mellowterranian Pizza   Took 2025 minutes to make  in a nearly empty restaurant   Was bread  a bunch of cheese  and a very small amount of chicken  olives and red pepper Get a gyro twice as tasty  twice as healthy and half the price down the street instead   Not worth the $13   Bartender was weird I think he thought I was homeless  or something I wont say I wont be back   A stripper with a Ph D  could beg to go on a date there and I would probably give it a second chance   Id make her pay  though ,negative,4264650

Good boba place with lots of variety in drinks and flavors and its the closest boba place to me  My favorite is the sea salt green tea and the sea salt coffee  The coffee tastes exactly like Lees ice coffee and strong  They have a stamp card so your 10th drink is free  Definitely becoming a regular  Only downside is I dont like the boba the texture and consistency is just not for me and I am picky with my boba and no boba has appealed to me here in vegas ,positive,1345369

Ordered the jungle curry and got a weird tasting soup  When I called the restaurant thinking I might have gotten the wrong order  the waiter tells me that its a healthy version of curry (which has no coconut component) and I argue that it was in the curry section hence I thought it was curry and he asked me if I even read the menu  So disappointed with our food  I actually yelped this place before I ordered  Never again!,negative,4116123
Amazing pizzas and pasta  The lamb cavatelli was perfectly cooked and so savoury service was phenomenal as well But what makes me give this place five stars is the amazing wine list  First off any place any place with lambrusco by the glass is instantly a hit in my books     Bubbly dry red wine goes perfectly with a pasta  The SP68 is a wonderful organic Italian red wine to die for  Smooth tunes over the speakers and little pizza lights really make the room cozy  Ill be here every day!,positive,284019
My favorite theatre in this area  The cheap nights are cool  One of the most important things about a theatre to me is how clean it is  This spot is always clean and fresh  The bathrooms always have towels for hand drying and clean floors and sinks  That a rare thing for a business as busy as this one Concessions are over priced  But then again what movie theatre isnt ,positive,3710681

Went to Old Town during a bar crawl event that my boyfriend and I were not apart of  Gringos was serving everyone  regardless of if they had an event wrist band or not  I got in just fine but the event bouncer wouldnt let my boyfriend in  He proceeded to ask him questions like where he worked and if he even had money to order anything  My boyfriend is black  Im white  as soon as I saw this happening I intervened and he was finally let in  We then tried to order drinks at the bar  We could not get service and kept getting overlooked by the bartenders  It was 2pm on a Saturday  it wasnt busy  no reason why my boyfriends drink order should be neglected  Im absolutely disgusted with this place and we will NEVER go back or recommend to anyone ,negative,6276740

Just got my pizza and the crust is soggy  I cant pick it up without using both hands  I making a huge mess trying to eat this pizza  Its more toppings on my plate then the actual slice as it is falling apart on me  When I called back I was told I would get a new pizza and a free 2 liter soda for my inconvenience   I received a new pizza with a firmer crust but no soda  Probably wont order from them again ,negative,3332548

I really love the gelato here  Ive tried lime and Ferrero Roche and they were both excellent  The latter really does taste like the delectable little chocolate and there are chunks of it found in the gelato  I have tried the Zazzu hot cones and I was not a fan of them  I didnt like the texture of the sausage and the server also omitted some vegetables that were supposed to come in my cone You can also try cupcakes  macarons  and an assortment of pastries  While I wouldnt return for the hot food  I would gladly return for more gelato goodness!,positive,2555736
One of my favorite restaurants for special occasion or romantic dinner  There was an awful loud vibration in the restaurant which the server said was the exhaust hood fans?  It made for an unenjoyable evening  However recent dinner was average and disappointing  Menu has changed and portions are smaller and lacking originality  This was our go to place but we will have to consider other options ,neutral,4060508
Mat Franco Magic Reinvented was a great show  He has a great story  a great stage presence  and did some great illusions  Mat tends to do many small illusions and tricks  unlike David Copperfield who tends to have larger illusions and tricks  Think a bottle of wine disappearing versus an airplane  So although hes no David Copperfield  I did enjoy Mats show and everyone in our large group said they had a good time too  Would recommend ,positive,3586262
They were amazing! Staff is always so warm and welcoming  dental hygienist is the best Ive ever had!! Been going there for about 3 years now and never a complaint  The 2 dentists there are not quick to diagnose just to make a buck  He also complimented the work that a previous dentist had performed which helped me to feel they were honest  Ive been really impressed with this place and would recommend them to anyone!,positive,5141379

I am somewhat reluctant to support the Great Satan of Bentonville  but as Walmarts go this one is quite good    Superstore with produce  reasonably clean and near and not too many empty shelves    Clientele are not undesirables and checkout was quite efficient   An extreme contrast to the piece of shit location on Lawrence Avenue ,neutral,1880660
I wouldnt recommend spending the money  The bus didnt even stop at our hotel at the first stop  We werent directly in front of the sign (which is right near the road) because we have 3 young children that wanted to run around a little bit  We saw the bus just roll by  So we waited another 30 minutes for the next bus to come by  We were able to get on the second one   We were only able to use the bus twice during their entire travel day  We decided we wanted to leave the strip prior to the last run of the night so we headed to the nearest stop  We waited over an hour and a bus never showed  We didnt see the second to last nor the last bus  This lead us to walk over 2 1/2 miles with tired  young kids back to our hotel  I wouldnt ever take this tour again  I want my money back!!!,negative,2881333

Poor communication  they made a simple process so frustrating   They never contacted me to ask questions about my account to get things moving but instead waited for me to call to get a status of my order for them to then ask a stupid question that was already provided before   My doctors referral was transferred to another pharmacy and they took care of my supplies the same day   Never again ,negative,4221312

This place is basically a Hawaiian Chipotle with a drive thru  That being said  Its really good  First the service  The girl at the counter was fantastic and so helpful  When she found our it was my first time  she immediately offered me a sample of pork and chicken (I also tried the fish)  I ended up getting a fish burrito  Its delicious  They give you the option of white or wheat tortilla (why hasnt chipotle figured that out?) which is great  I ended up getting as spicy a burrito as I could  My only issue is that the only hot sauces available are mild and medium  I of course wanted something hotter  but all in all it was a good experience  I wish Id seen the Yelp deal  but theres usually a Groupon so no worries ,positive,5457688

Ive been to this place twice now  Not too impressed with the service  We walked in last night and stood looking at the beer menu since there were not 2 seats together at the bar  Two employees  including the owner  sat at the bar taking up 3 seats (a dirty dish towel on one)  which they could have adjusted so we could have sat  No one greeted us or offered help  Finally the owner  who was seated looking at an iPad  asked if he could help and when I told him what I wanted to try  he said Well I am trying to take a breather here but sure Ill get it   Then why ask if he can help?? Poor attitude and service  Pretty good beer selection but there are too many local breweries to go to instead if you will be treated in that manner ,negative,3029668

Wow!  What else can I say?  I definitely went into a sugar coma  but it was worth it   The meal started with amazing scratch made cornbread   We asked for the favorites and received beef ribs  catfish and chicken   All were great and the sides were perfect   The best was the mashed potatoes    you read that correctly   How can you make an ordinary dish so exciting?  The yams were a desert all their own   We finished the meal with a red velvet cake by recommendation and it was not as good as the recommendation   It was a great experience that I really enjoyed  Thanks Harold from the Hyatt for the recommendation ,positive,6465545

It was our last night in Vegas and my husband wanted Italian  Being from New York (and having an Italian husband!) my expectations were high  The restaurant had a nice  homey atmosphere with an open kitchen  It was fun to see the meals being prepped and watching them come out  We started with the caprese salad and fried calamari  The burrata was delicious  The calamari was crisp and light and very tender  For our main diss  we shared the Valestro family gravy  What a hit! We both loved the gravy ! Very authentic  homemade sauce  Italian husband said one of the best hes ever tasted  Portions were nicely sized  Sever was on point but not very attentive  One HUGE complaint  a bread basket was not provided!! A great Italian restaurant with no bread so sop up all of that saucy goodness??! Come on Buddy! Breadsticks in a bag! You can do a lot better than that! Lost a star on the bread issue   We will return on our next visit  with our own loaf of Italian bread!,positive,3237029
Ychhh  Ordered beef and broccoli  egg rolls  wonton soup  moo shu pork and spare ribs to take out  How can I say this? Everything was weird  The broccoli was so overcooked  it was inedible  The beef was slimy and tasteless  The egg rolls are minuscule  Ive rolled blunts bigger than these   The wontons were just small slabs of under cooked dough with no meat inside  Who puts cucumbers in wonton soup? The spare ribs were big and meaty but what was that wet brown sauce they were swimming in? The moo shu was OK  thats why I added an extra star  but the Hoisin sauce was watered down  The fake duck sauce was awful Im tough on chinese restaurants  I compare them to the better Chinatown places in Vegas  NY  Philly and San Fransisco  None in the west valley that I know of  ever come close  But this one is a distant last place ,negative,6498284

Fabulous!  We stopped for a quick app and beer and there were no tables available   The bartender/shucker/server offered to seat us right up front at the bar and we happily obliged   My fiancee and I ordered raw oysters (they had a dozen varieties that night) and baked oysters (5 types)   The raw came out with 3 special sauces and a freshly grated horseradish (I saw them grate it right before serving) and they were as fresh as you could ask for   The baked unfortunately were forgotten by the server but he admitted that and served us 2 sets of 3 raws on the house because of the delay   What service!  Every party that came in while we sat there (without reze) was asked to wait a sec and tables were checked to see if they could be fit in   Again  great service by all 4 people that night   Definitely a regular spot for us as we stop into TO monthly ,positive,1081392
Peoria Kia gave me a quote for a new vehicle with a trade in  I considered the deal overnight and decided to finalize the offer   When I contacted Peoria Kia to purchase the vehicle  Peoria Kia rescinded the offer and proceeded to lie!

I chose this restaurant  because of all the views it had on yelp   I was surprised to see this place in a strip mall   The food there was amazing   All though we had 3 different servers     the service was really good   The food was amazing   The Cesar salad was a bit on the spicy side   Not too sure what made it a lil spicy   The cheesecake was delicious doe desert   They even give you chocolate  carmel & strawberry to dip it in   The pasta was amazing   I loved the cream and it wasnt dry   Usually I can never get enough sauce with my pasta   It tasted like it was homemade recipe ,positive,1977920
Im training for my first marathon and needed to get fitted for new running shoes  A family member highly recommended Red Rock Running Company  Their fitting process is amazing  Theyre very attentive and the process itself  using video of the customer running on the treadmill  ensures the best possible shoe choice and fit   Ive run a number of half marathons and Ive been fitted for shoes several times before   I admit Ive been guilty of buying shoes based on color  style or price alone in the past  and blisters and pain were the unfortunate result  This fitting  by Brent  was by far the most thorough   He really spent time with me to be sure I was getting the right shoe for my feet and my running style ,positive,2958994

The store was very clean and the water was stocked very well and with many different brands  If one is not into water like I am they stock many different types of beverages to keep cool like Sobe and cold tea  When I decided to pay for the purchases I also noticed that they sell hot food here and have a large variety of different hot foods available  Such as tacos  pizza  and hamburgers  I did not try any of them but all looked fresh and smelled good  This is a great place to find little trinkets such as necklaces for summer really inexpensively and other little summer must haves  The cashier was wonderful and professional  Next time the car and I need fuel and Im on this side this will be our fill up location ,positive,834554

Met a work colleague here for a late dinner  Objective: A place in the Fashion Show Mall with a decent list of wines by the glass and somewhat healthy fare  We had originally planned to dine at Nordstrom Cafe (a fave) but they closed earlier than CPK  which delivered beautifully   Nice atmosphere and OK service  although I had to stalk our server a bit for H20   The miso salad (I do the half with shrimp  dressing on side  no crispy rice sticks) is my fave of the salads here  Its fabulous and inventive   The $5ish small bite appetizers arent much of a deal because the portions are so tiny  but while I usually get scandalized when something that seems like a value isnt  I was OK in this case   We shared a meditteranean combo ap and it proved to be a great way to distract me from the bread basket ,positive,3611201

Stopped in here to take advantage of the 2 free drinks that Luxor included as part of their resort fee (Im not sure if thats a special I got  or if thats just what everyone gets)  Its a nice bar  the layout is very open and inviting  Dark interior colors and plush couches make it ideal as a late night spot to post up and relax a bit while you have a nightcap or two  Our free drinks tickets were limited in their use  like I pretty much expected  so when we ordered 2 Red Bull and vodkas the bartender said we could only get a Sobe Adrenaline and vodka  Sure  whatever    just make it a good pour  Which he didnt  Drink was decent enough  Good spot to relax at  but nothing more  Most cocktails are so overpriced that I wouldnt say a casual stop here is worth it unless youre taking advantage of Luxors offer ,neutral,4616342
Rude and bizarre service   No true breakfast pastries  just donuts in the am and a full blown  vanilla filled cream puff   The donut/twist is so ordinary  I mistook it for a Dunkin donut   I ask the girl politely for a cup of water with ice   Youd think I requested a free ride on the mars shuttle   She stares at me   I guess they speak steel mill / blue collar anese here  So I repeat the simple question: May I please get a cup of water with ice along with the donut?  Then she explains that they only sell bottled water and have no ice  At the register  they have the nasty East coast trend of enforcing a credit card minimum   I pay with cash and  you got it  shes mildly offended that I provide a $20  Weird weird place  Theres got to be much better in the area ,negative,4355977

Went with my younger sister and her friend for lunch  It was packed to the Max so we had to wait a while and I was kind concerned about how they kept track of who came in when because people were pouring in  Anyway  Service was OK  But it was a busy lunch hour so I could see that happening  Oftentimes with AYCE sushi  orders get left out and such and that happened on and off throughout our lunch  We double ordered as a result and found ourselves stuffing food down our throats so as not to waste  Im no guru when it comes to sushi rolls but these are the best Ive had  Both the udon noodle soup and dish were tasty  Anything that was fried in tempura and then wrapped was amazing  Didnt like their teriyaki chicken  It was dry and not cooked well  Green tea ice cream was a good pallet cleanser at the end  I would definitely recommend it as a cheap sushi spot ,neutral,6292389

I really like Marilyns Cafe at Tuscany  They have very tasty meals  good portions  and are well priced   Friday nights are fun to enjoy all you can eat crab legs  makes for a nice healthy meal when you order double vegetables as your sides ,positive,2546390
I was looking for a cake for my husbands birthday  I called and asked what kind of cakes they had that day  The lady mentioned a couple which included a chocolate raspberry cake  It was perfect  exactly what my husband had requested  or so i thought  I went in and found out it was frozen  No one had mentioned that  They did promise it would be ready to eat in 2 hours and that it was made fresh that day  i asked for certainty several times because I did have guests   Well after 5 hours including one hour in my car in 90 degrees  it was still semi frozen  The cake was beautifully made and may have been good  ill never know ,negative,2739565
A solid 4 5 star  I got here at 11am on Saturday just when it opened to avoid the wait  I made the right decision because when I got out of here at 11:40am  there were people waiting out the door  Anyways  I ordered the Carne sammich with sirloin meat medium rare  which also contained the chimmi sauce  caramelized onion  and roasted peppers  The meat was really tender and juicy  and it was just the right amount of medium rare  I could really appreciate the woodfired grill taste in the meat  Also  the roasted peppers were definitely a plus because they made the sammich that much more flavorful  The sammich was a 5star  Now  the Gaucho Slaw was mediocre at best  It lacked somewhat of a flavor  and it wasnt the best slaw Ive had at a place like this  To conclude  if theres one thing Im jealous of Pittsburgh  it will be the fact that they have Gaucho Parrilla in their town ,positive,121294
First the 10 year old young man who waited on us was remarkable!! He knew the menu and assisted me in making my selection (beef rib  collards and yans)   The food was great  well seasoned and just TASTY!  I must say that I will go back cuz I was too full to eat dessert :)  THANKS little guy for the EXCELLENT customer service ,positive,1145184
Classic example of corporate culture ruining a bar  Went here 2 nights in a row with friends  First night  3 of us were seated by the hostess  only to have the waitress yell at us because these tables can only be seated by me   she is not allowed to put you here!!!! Service was good after that  although the rough opening made it tough  Second night  we had 3 tables on the patio watching the hockey game  Mid 2nd quarter  the TV switched to the Raptors game  We asked to have it put back since only hockey fans were out there  and were told it was company policy that all TVs had to be on Toronto sports  Literally 100 tvs  a place more than half empty  bc every single TV has to be on the Raptors  even if no one was watching it      and they made 3 tables leave to go next door to the Loose Moose (which is freaking awesome always go here not Jack Astors   ) bc of bizarre corporate rules  Anyway   3 stars for beer   1 stars for management ,negative,741287
Best shopping for scrapbook supplies in Vegas! The owner was super helpful and the stock was very eclectic  Something for everyone! Cant wait to go back now that I am in town:),positive,551234
We got Sunday brunch at the Grand Concourse and it was awesome  First of all the building is amazing  a well preserved architectural gem of Pittsburghs past  We were seated promptly at our reservation time in the main dining room and tucked in to their numerous offerings  They had a full spread of classic breakfast items  numerous salads  shrimp cocktail  smoked salmon  carving section  made to order omelettes  french toast  crepes and pancakes  a donut machine  and full dessert bar  The food is spread out among the whole of the restaurant  so you get to see a lot of the rooms while you gather your plate  Coffee was good  server attended to our beverage needs throughout our meal and we left very satisfied  Worth the money and the calories ,positive,5998776
My client and I had lunch here yesterday and let me tell you  it was Amazing  We were waited on pretty quick  We ordered appetizers that ideally would take longer than expected  but got it fairly quick  My client ordered the Avocado rolls I think and I had the Ahi Poke  which can I add was delicious  We later had our burgers and that could not have been any better  My client has the Black N Bleu Burger and I had the Turkey Burger  My Golly  it was nice  juicy  and just hit the spot  Amazing I tell you ,positive,3671323
This place is great! I have a severe gluten allergy and they are always so good about preparing my pizza  Absolutely delicious!!,positive,5474854
Ordered one of their party trays  The portions were sort of on the skimpy side  Presentation was not good  The rolls and nigiri were sort of mashed up against each other  which made it kind of embarrassing when it was tabled at our party  Quality and taste was nothing spectacular  just your average fare  Also  they forgot about our soups ,negative,4110812
There was definitely a solid 20 mi its wait when we came on Sunday at 10:50AM    but it was SO worth it! My mom and I came for a hearty grub and as my mom makes good decisions  I regularly copy her and we both got the elevated egg sandwich  It was amazing! The potatoes did not disappoint either  I cant wait to try more on the menu and for the weather to cool off and sit on the patio!,positive,5081261
The sushi was pretty good; though the red dragon roll didnt look like the picture  The prices also seems to have gone up since the last time we went there  We usually get the specialbut that was ~$20 and the dragon roll was $18  Nice decor; but a bit expensive now,positive,5029865
This is the 2nd time to this place in about 2 years time  The siblings and I came here to visit after they arrived in town  I didnt eat anything tonight as Id eaten earlier  They all had fabulous food  I shot photos of most all the food  There was two salads a black bean veggie burger and a mother load burger  There was fresh cut fries and chips  Everybody loved the food  the atmosphere  and drinks Great time ,positive,5328772
The staff is good  but expect an hour wait minimum  Ive been bringing my kids here for years and the wait has gotten out of control  The last three times we have been  the typical wait is 30mins in the main lobby and another 30 to 40 in the patient room I feel like this is a long time to keep kids waiting  I would expect longer waits if your child is sick  but these visits have been for shots and well checks  These appointments were also scheduled way in advance ,negative,5019719
So the service is horrible  get over it  But  that roasted crackling pork is sooooo good I got the roasted pork/duck rice plate  It is super moist and the skin is perfect  The dim sum is not bad either (try the Hau Gaw) I noticed all the other Asians got the Wonton Noodle soup  and it looked amazing  I would do that next time This places opens until midnight on the weekends for a late night snack too!,positive,4535485
I love wood fired Pizza and these folks made it just right   This restaurant is located in an upscale strip center   Good food for dine in or take out ,positive,2463270
I love this place  we go almost three times a month  their shrimp pizza is to die for  The only reason Im giving 4 stars  is because theyre take out is always way less then their actual serving portions  However the staff is very friendly and accommodating ,positive,2456770
We made a quick stop at this casino on a Saturday night while we were visiting Phoenix We arrived around 8 pm and it was packed!!I am not a big gambler  so I am pretty happy to find a penny or nickel slot machine and try my luck with a twenty dollar bill   We circled the casino twice and couldnt find any penny machines I found a machine that allowed me to make forty cent bets and had a good run of luck   I quit when I was ahead $7 and my husband lost $5  so combined we came out $2 ahead   We each had a fun 20 minutes at our respective machines We had fun  but this place is somewhat bare bones compared to other casinos I have been to in CA   I would have been really happy with true penny machines too!As usual  lots of smoke  that helps me cut down on the time I want to spend in casinos ,neutral,6075575
Love this BDubs! Our experiences here have always been great ones We went there tonight  and Elan was fabulous! Very attentive to our needs and questions We would have gave 5 stars  however we found out tonight  that they have discontinued the jammin jalapeno flavored sauce  It was a family favorite  PLEASE bring it back! Thanks! Smiles   ,positive,3503640
This place lacks decor but I came here for food so heres the food review  I asked for the spider roll  fattie yellow tail nigiri  a cucumber salad  and seared beef  The cucumber salad could use a bit more oomph  perhaps a touch of vinegar? While the softshell crab in the spider roll was good  there was too much rice in the roll  I thoroughly enjoyed the seared beef and the yellow tail nigiri and I will come back for more of these two items ,neutral,5528300
Went here to buy some bread but they were closed early @5:45pm The clock on their wall is 15m ahead  I showed the cashier the correct time and she said so what!Dont go here The bread is expired and the employees are rude,negative,6242104
We ate here about 6 months ago and had a nice experience and then again last night and really enjoyed it  As you think about going here  you really dont want to eat in a hotel (Renaissance) restaurant and feel like it cant possibly be good but give it a try  It is extremely convenient for hitting before a show next door at the Byham or across the street at the Heinz We intended to try the Streetside bar/ restaurant but it was packed out so went to the full restaurant  Gotta say  we really like the ambience in the lobby and restaurant  soft lighting  good colors  inviting sofas/ chairs  and never much noise at all   We were promptly seated  and the server was friendly and never intrusive The food is moderately expensive (a hotel after all) but is VERY well presented  excellent portions  and was all very tasty  They have lots of coupons/ deals out there  so if you can find one of those and stop by before a show  this is a nice  unexpected place ,positive,5953422
A friend recommended this place to me  I forgot which Chinese province the noodles dishes originate from  but they provided a good change of pace from typical Chinese restaurants   The broths are quite complex and have unique flavours to them  A lot more pickled ingredients than the average place  During your meal  they provide a cart which contains a variety of delicious condiments  Each dish was only between $9  11 which is very reasonable  Good portion sizes as well ,positive,88679
The new owner has completely turned this store around for the best service possible  I highly recommend this place for all your shipping needs  Also  for any type of office needs  from faxes to fingerprinting and packaging needs ,positive,4935245
Hi all! Went to Matts last night for the PJs and Eggs! Matt was great a bunch of the guys from Hickman farms were there having breakfast too! The special was steak and eggs  while I originally had my little heart set on a butter burger I had to try the Steak and eggs  I was not disappointed it was fantastic! Just as I suspected  I think I am becoming a Matts groupie! lol  I cant help it between the cozy atmosphere  the friendly staff  fresh delicious menu choices and given that I am supporting a family business I am hooked! Now I will say last night we waited about an hour and there were 5 of us but all agreed it was so worth the wait  PS I had to get a butter burger to go I had it for lunch today YUM! Thanks Erenia and Matt!,positive,1735888
This place sucks and expensive!!!Its a nice establishment  but then again what do expect from Mandalay Bay? I came after looking at the ratings  Its true it sucks that more when the ratings are high and it fails to live up to it! Did I say how hard it was to find in a big ass casino?,negative,5539464
This review was actually for panda express NOT Chef Panda  Dont know how that happened but my apologies ,negative,5593039
Very unusual desserts style of crepes  they were good  We all enjoyed them  Only problem we were a group of 6 and when we got there we realized there was only a few tables and had to wait standing for a table and waited a long time for our crepes too  But the food was good,positive,5862826
not too pleased  i mean it was a fine enough experience but my entire appointment lasted 30 min with an advanced stylist at $90  felt a bit ripped off  Also  in a tipbased buisness it would be wise to get a credit/debit machine that allows customers to include tip   Telling customers you only accept cash tips and you can do a cashback on the machine is a bit ridiculous   Who carries cash in todays world!?!,negative,6616649
We came here on a Wednesday night to try out this place   It got pretty busy 1hr before closing   The selections were good  but not as creamy and smooth textured as I expected from other Thaistyle ice cream places   Still we enjoyed our orders and appreciated the friendly workers with their skills on the cold metal plates ,neutral,5968745
Lunch buffet was great! $11 99  plenty of choices and they are very accommodating  Garlic naan was amazing!,positive,3560273
If I am craving bagels I come here  Always fresh (still hot when you put them in the bag) and a large selection  Great bread and loaf selection too  Also love the cheese bourekas  Bagels are $0 75 each and cheaper with increased quantity Bourekas are $0 75 each as wellLoafs/other sweets are about $510Love the fresh chive cream cheese  Its a bit pricey at about $8 a small container  but it goes so well with those bagels I can never resist ,positive,3088191
Second time here   First time just dropped in without any knowledge of the place   (Out of towner and did not know the area was upscale )  Both times my husband and I were extremely happy with our meals   Wait staff is very attentive  Outside of the building is nothing to write home about   The inside is very nice   Relaxed atmosphere  Very Very clean  We will be back every time we are in Las Vegas   About 3 times a year  My only complaint is that it is noisy   The floor is tiled and my guess is that there is nothing to absorb the noise  (Lots of talking going on) Maybe some tapestries or something to deaden the sound   This aspect will not stop us from going back   I have superduper hearing   Maybe the noise level is okay and it is just me:),positive,4394713
This place is awesome  Nice ambience  a lot of goodlooking people every time I go  As sad as it is  food that is healthy and cheap has become oxymoronic  Their prices are super low for the quality of food that you get   Buckwheat crepes and the salad are my favourites  Shockingly tasty for vegan  Great service as well ,positive,5455857
I have seen this place a few times and wanted to give it a try   I am glad I did   First I have had a few Cheesesteaks in my day while I lived in Philly for 8 years  I also ate at the places namesake  Genos in South Philly   No not as good  sorry Gilbert Genos  but without the Philly bread you had no shot   On the good side  the bread was decent and their Genos steak was made CORRECTLY with cheese whiz  If you have never had a real Philly then do yourself the favor and get it wit whiz  wit back there means onions and whiz well  I am sure you know what that is   The manager there was very friendly and attentive and when he found out I had lived in Philly he was very interested in my opinions   I did give him the suggestion for gravy fries a staple at diners all over that area  The place was clean  the food was delivered quickly and happily the place was busy for a Thursday lunch I will defiantly be back    oh and other Philly fanatics  yes they have Tastykakes for sale ,positive,2276299
Looks like the pricing leveled off for now  at least until they build the next location  Still bitter about: Upcharge for Fries (should never happen)   Spring Training happy Hour cancellationThe pretzels now need some attention  they are just not good anymore and the cheese sauce that goes along is as dated as this location  BTW when is that next door expansion coming? The pretzels are more shiny  than tasty  more air than bread  You still get two at happy Hour  but 6 years ago they used to be tops in town  but now just a bad pretzel  Happy Hour domestic beers remain 3 bucks and plenty of sports still on the tubes  so will continue to frequent this place once in awhile ,negative,3461785
Wow  would not have expected the meal we had to come from here    Met Chef Tom outside and my friends and I decide to give it a try and what a great surprise  You need to spread the word    Thanks Tom for the dip and great suggestions ,positive,6481546
First I have to say that this place has excellent service   Waiters were extremely prompt and very polite   We were initially sitting inside but when we requested to sit on the balcony  they quickly moved our party   The view from the balcony is amazing the the ambiance is perfect for a romantic dinner or a classy dinner for a bachelors party which is what we had   As for the food  the calamari was awesome and everyone agreed it was one of the best wed ever had   They also gave us some complimentary appetizer which had cheese and tomatoes on lays potato chips which were delicious!Most of us ended up ordering the 40 day old steak   Ive had much better steak for half the price   Wasnt impressed at all to be honest   Overall  I would have given it a 5 star if it wasnt for the steak   I would definitely go back though!,positive,1125894
How can you not love the 24 ounce porterhouse steak the seasoned rice and the atmosphere here everything about this place says Texas and sports   oh might I add the peanuts you eat and just eat messy  whats better than that come on in,positive,1787699
These guys are real professionals above my expectations    I had a broken door for my boat I cant believe how they made exact copy of it  Saved me other a thousand of dollars other buying a new unit from SeaDoo directly  Stefan definitely knows how to handle his business  So far I had 2 projects done and makes me wanna think what else should I let them fabricate  ),positive,5095296
Get the grilled Pork bahn mi sandwhich and summer rolls (the A2 & S2)  Also lately been really into their Thai Bubble Tea (served over ice is the way to do it) even though these are loaded w sugar they are a tasty treat ,positive,1323882
Highly recommend!!!!!! When I first called to book a reservation  they didnt just write the name down  they took the time to tell me what shed be doing  things to bring to make her feel more at home and answered all questions I had  Another great thing about it was getting to see her picture on Facebook everyday which was a great comfort to see she was having fun and playing with the other dogs  I knew she was safe and happy and sure enough when I picked her up she came home like shed just hung out with her buds for a week  Thank you to the team and John especially!,positive,1742747

Its a MUST  as a picky burger lover I can say this is absolutely the best burger you can find on planet earth,positive,3284354
This is a great liquour store  with a very knowledgeable staff   There is a gentleman there with a sharp wit and dry sense of humor that I always enjoy listening to   Additionally he is ultra knowledgeable about liquor   If you are looking for solid quality but the best price point his suggestions have always been spot on   If you are looking for something new and a bit of a treat he always has suggestions for that as well   If you go  sign up for the newsletter   It is funny  tells you when they have special things in  and gives you info on various new products ,positive,5214452
Good location   Multiple options for various cuts  I found the cocktail offerings to be uninspired for a prime retail outlet  hence the 4 stars ,positive,1367952
OMG I  in & out but this place really has an awesome burger  We got an Italian sub as well that was just amazing  Family owned friendly & endless supply of soda  Im not a big fan of soda but did have a root beer on tap  Would of like a beer to go with the burger ,positive,3975749
This was hands down the worst hospital experience I have ever encountered  My uncle was admitted after having a severe heart attack; coming from a tight knit  large family  we were all concerned yet still remained optimistic that his health may not be completely shattered  Well  that all changed when the cardiologist condescendingly explained his current state and laughed at the thought of a miracle seriously  awful human  The hospital staff was no better  Its as if everyone operates independently within the hospital  We heard seven different stories from different nurses and doctors  leaving us up in the air as to what is happening  They were cold and unwelcoming  making us feel like a burden  Last time I checked  we were paying for everything here  To top this awful experience off  the entire facility needs to be revamped and fixed  I felt as if I was in an insane asylum  not a hospital  Kudos  PV hospital ,negative,5624451
I really want to give them a 2 5  Just left a meeting nearby and I wanted a chicken salad  I came in around 9:30pm during Game 7 of the World Series and the energy was perfect  The place wasnt super crowded but it took longer than normal to order  Then it took a while to pay I ordered a Crispy a chicken Salad with Extra Chicken  They never put enough on so I dont mind paying for extra  Of course my food comes out to go and there is No extra chicken  The bartender says Yeah that does look like the normal amount  Ill go handle it for you  She come back with a container about 5 minutes later and its even less Chicken than what came on the salad  I guess I shouldve asked for Double Chicken  But this is still one of my favorite locations  Good environment  clean  and good Customer Service ,negative,2559221
Whenever I want to go have a nice sit down lunch this is my absolute favorite  Although it isnt much to look at from the outside  its very comfortable on the inside  The food is so fresh  The waitresses are very prompt  We always take our clients here  If you are near the Airport and want to have an awesome lunch business or otherwise this is the place!,positive,6369817

Do not use  This company was recommended by Lyons Plumbing after my kitchen sink drain pipe broke  Adams Restoration said insurance would cover everything  There would  be no charge to me  When they found out the insurance coverage they stopped work and billed for more than the insurance check  The only work they did was to clean the water up  It was misrepresentation and high pressure sales  The 5 star review are likely friends of the owners,negative,905692
This is my least favorite DMV  But this time it was quick and painless  The lady that helped me this time was excellent! She even let me run out to my car an remove my plate while she was transferring our first vehicle to Nevada  2 stars for her 0 for the DMV ,negative,5289203
Our order was placed pretty quickly when we arrived but our meal took 45 minutes to arrive to the table and was incorrect  but we were too hungry to send it back  During our 45 minute wait  our beverages  even though they were just water  were never refilled   We saw another couple arrive  order  and pay their check through the duration of our wait  Also  when I approached our waitress about this  she said that everyones wait was long and that our food would be out soon  no apology  The check was incorrect and we were charged for extra crab when my boyfriends dish contained no crab at all  On top of that  the food was just ok  approaching subpar Save your time and money  just go to Thai Taste ,negative,4137407
3 5 stars   rounded up   Ive always been a fan of Panda Express   nor sure why as most of them are usually found in mall food courts  or the like  This one is clean  quick  convenient  and reasonable  given the portion sizes   Plus  its a stand alone store  which makes it different than the others   Quite simply  its Asian fare served swiftly with a good set of choices from mild to spicy   Theres a choice of entrees and sides  all priced according to your hunger level (one  two  or three entree portion sizes)  Its by no means fine dining  but its a solid alternative when shopping in the Monroeville area and youre looking for flavorful food but not looking for a traditional sit down meal that takes some time   Its worth the stop   and it wont take long to order and chow down ,positive,50367
I love Buffalo Wild Wings but there service at this location is awful   The employees dont care about there jobs clearly  the place is always filthy food all over the floor  they let tables sit dirty for a long period of time  last time I was there 3 tables set dirty for over an hour not being cleaned off   I will never return to this location again especially after them forgetting my food twice in 1day   I really hope a hooters will open nearby and run this place out ,negative,2374649

The Orpheum theater is absolutely stunning as a venue and would love to see even more events held here   We recently saw the music of Journey and a contemporary ballet at the Orpheum theater   Just being in this venue evokes a certain nostalgic experience of playhouses of yesteryear   The really have some state of the art equipment  however some of the sound systems could be adjusted to reflect the singer  band and the symphony to really capture each appropriately  I like the downstairs lounge/bar area away from the main hustle and bustle of the entrance ,positive,4748131
It was negative 6 degrees outside and I knew I HAD TO GET MY GELATO FIX Today was the first day I visited ever since Kekou renovated  Now there is extra seating  two tables at the front  and 3 larger tables in the back of the store  There is also wifi for people whod like to sit down  do some work  and eat delicious gelato! I got the durian gelato and delicious as ALWAYS with quick service  They have many drinks with prices that are on the same level as other bubble tea shops ($4 2~$4 7) but I think Kekou would have better bubble tea if the level of quality they strive for is the same as the quality for gelato  In addition  the Saigon Fog drink is coming soon! Im excited especially for their Saigon Fog with Viet Coffee gelato and tapioca  So delicious and I will definitely return!,positive,3234072
Came here for dinner  and I probably wouldnt return here to dinein  Service was horrible! We walked in and waited where we were supposed to (near the please wait here sign)  one waitress was like one moment  so we waited and she walked away  Another waitress comes towards the table  sees us and told us after that she thought the other waitress helped us  We waited for about 10 minutes  That was ridiculous  After getting seated  our waitress took the longest time to come take our order  at this point I just wanted to leave  However  the food was delicious!! We got the coconut shrimp as an appetizer  and the fajita fiesta for 2 as our main course  Both were well done  and we were satisfied with meal  Wouldnt be back at this location for dinein though  probably try another location ,negative,653583
So  corporate finally responds to one of my emails from 5 months ago with a curt apology and offer me a free meal  Yeah  no  How about a refund from the last 68 terrible meals and equally horrid service  I dont miss you Cafe Rio!,negative,4532545
Little City Grill is probably the cutest little place in Boulder City despite the dedicated parking area for motorcycles  the interior is decked out in grandmas finest country decor  Its a cozy spot with warm and attentive service  Though the menu highlights their burgers  I opted for a healthier choice with their BBQ Chicken Chopped Salad  which is also featured as a favorite customer item  The salad was huge and fresh  with plenty of veggies and just the right balance of ranch and barbecue sauces to give it flavor without drowning it in sauce  Ill update when I go back for their Kobe burger!,positive,3438613
This was the second time I have been here and it was super crowded and so busy on a Friday night  but luckily we found 2 spots to sit at the bar  Our Bartender was Jessica and she was amazing  We got served our drinks and we ordered food at the bar too  Jessica was so slammed  yet she was so great  She got our food out to us quickly and she was right on top of our drink refills  Besides the food being wonderful  great service is what made this trip to Cheddars a very nice Friday night  Thank u Jessica ,positive,5655607

We just stayed in Palazzo for 3 nights and this became our little go to spot for small treats and drinks   I loved their gelato  especially the stracciatella   Soooooo good in the chocolate dipped waffle cone   My girls got crepes (berry and banana)  frapes and other various coffee drinks that they seemed to enjoy Their breakfast menu was limited  so we went elsewhere for that  but overall a safe find for treats!,positive,6059355
Not bad  The cashier was nice  Quick with our order  The place was clean and well stocked with food  We had several items that tasted very fresh  I did not care much for the mushroom soup  It was a little rich for my taste  The baked potatoes were good with all of the toppings they offer  People came by often and picked up or plates   I remember there being more items   when I was younger  but it was still good  Or maybe Im thinking of sweet tomatoes ,neutral,3926704
I joined in December 2017 after Smart Gym  without notice closed  Smart Gym was small  but it was clean  The same cleaning person was there everyday  and I saw her cleaning equipment LA Fitness on the inside looks exactly like it did when it was the Q in the 90s  From splatter paint to weird gold ceiling tiles Staff is apathetic  and it obvious that they are minimum wage employees  Not to mention the extreme turnover in sales staff and managers The other reviews are spot on  the place is dirty  From empty paper towel dispensers to overflowing trash cans  Ive never seen an employee cleaning a machine and it shows  Reported broken equipment  sometimes isnt addressed The only reason I go  it is 5 minutes from home  Smart Gym was 3 minutes from home The plus  yes they have a lot of weight equipment  I think that is it ,negative,2314727
My buddy recommended me this place for haircut  The haircut here is inexpensive  CAD 10 00  however this is not a fancy place  Rambo helped me with the haircut  He is welcoming  funny and gave me an excellent haircut  Considering the price point it is ideal place for students or people seeking quick haircuts  No appointments needed  However  store does not accept credit cards  so it is cash only ,positive,3669180
Returned here after a few years between visits    My previous breakfast experiences had been great  but this time (for lunch) disappointing   Had the skillet which had overcooked scrambled eggs atop a congealed mess of potatoes  etc   My guest (whod never been here & to whom Id highly recommended the 40th St  Cafe) had a similarly mediocre meal   Maybe an off day for the cook? I still like the diner vibe and the service is just fine  plus prices are reasonable   Will try again & hopefully this recent experience was just an anomaly ,negative,4339808
Dining here was a weird experience  Te menu was grimy; the bathrooms were worse  and the general atmosphere was gloomy We were basically ignored by our waiters  one of whom disappeared half way through and never reappeared  the other who appeared to hate life (or his job)  We ordered a pitcher of sangria  which was mediocre and came with mismatched glasses  There was a gap in between when we were served that wasnt explained or apologized for  and the perogies I ordered were lackluster  The salad was just a pile of lettuce with some carrots that seemed to have been soaking in water for a few hours (or days   )  We waited forever for our bill  and even then  we were not at all pleasantly served  There were maybe two other tables at the time  so I really dont understand the terrible service  I was in great company  so that made it enjoyable  but I will not return ,negative,886364
My husband and I were excited to try Ryu but were sadly disappointed  We opted for sushi (not teppanyaki) based on the reviews  It was still happy hour so we got four different rolls  NONE of which were special  The sushi was subpar at best 1 star was also for the TERRIBLE service  The restaurant was pretty empty and the server was completely inattentive  It was almost a joke ,negative,3775766
Great service and very accommodating to tastes  My fav was the arancini and mussels  The chef was super friendly and made our orders to our preferences  Id love to go back to see what other dishes of the day are available ,positive,1572611
sorry this place sucks  most of the prices here are the same as retail  not a lot of stores for guys unless you like atheltic wear  Outlet malls used to be very cool and nice and you used to be able to get good deals  now the best you can do is get $5 off or some 2 for 1 deal that basically saves you $5$10  not worth the hassle of parking and walking around in the hot sun all day  just not that great of an experience or stores ,negative,6630399
Putting sport orientated TVs all over Bank & Baron is just a crime  This place has a lot of potential but is aiming for a very wrong crowd  It should be classy establishment but in practice is more baseball cap red neck place ,neutral,4270172
Ive been going to this salon for about six months  Ive had about a dozen gel manicures and 34 pedicures  I love their service and the fact the wait isnt too long if you dont have an appointment  My gel manicure lasts at least 2 weeks  and Im really tough on my nails  I would highly recommend this salon!,positive,2992116

Its probably bad timing as they are in the midst of a renovation  but I can only comment on what I experienced   Its an ok Hampton Inn   The breakfast was ok  the kept most things fresh and stocked  but the space was small and became crowded with just a few people   The staff was friendly and helpful   The room was ok  but the bed was not a typical Hampton bed   I hope they are upgrading these   If we came through this area again we might try another Hilton property  but in wouldnt be opposed to staying here again ,neutral,3287979
These guys are fucking amazing my friend cracked my phone screen last night and I looked everywhere for reasonable prices a lot of other places were charging around $160  $180 to fix my iPhone 5 but these guys only charged me $112 they honestly had the best customer service and were very friendly would definitely recommend this place to all my friends and family who have any smart phone related problems,positive,5093545
was good enough bread   As a vegetarian i cant say anything about the meat   Produce was standard enough   The staff is friendly enough   A little better quality food than subway type sandwiches so worth a little more as reflected in price   Still feel like its fair for the food   Worth checking out!,neutral,6654454
Yummy Korean BBQ! Finally an all you can eat k BBQ in Arizona! Service was amazing  staff was very friendly  However  I feel that theres something missing in their bulgogi sauce and the marinade sauce  Overall  pretty good for a new k BBQ place!

Love  love  love this hotel!! Im not sure what itll look after its transformation to a St Regis (Im sure itll be even better) but the property is still gorgeous and comfortable the way it is now  Ive stayed at this property several times (when it was still the Trump) and Ive always loved the location  The staff are extremely gracious and helpful  The gym is located (I believe) on the 34th floor and views of the city are breathtaking  They actually have good exercise equipment and ample space to get a good workout in  The pool area is quiet and relaxing  The restaurant is visually stunning and although weve had a couple apps  we normally just go for a cocktail or two before dinner  So happy this is now an SPG property soon to become a St Regis  between this place and The Ritz  you cant go wrong!!,positive,3539922
This place is absolutely horrible  I took my BRAND NEW car in to get it washed and after it came out and they called me to get my car  theres was a GIANT crack in my windshield that ran from top to bottom  I almost screamed I was so upset  Upon asking them what the hell they did  they explained it was already there before  EXCUSE ME? I think I would have noticed my windshield cracked in half when I drove it here  They wouldnt do anything about it either  My car was also very dirty still  Absolutely ridiculous ,negative,5435154
3 words   chicken & french toast  Damn good  some secret batter and french toast was like cakeish Its not meant to be fancy  fly or edgy  its a diner friends so adjust the expectations  Its a diner  like a greasy spoon  great for breakfast  lunch or late night after the bar is out bite and sober up food b/c its 24/7 ,positive,46047
We had been turned out of quite a few brewpubs today because we have a one year old  BUT we were warmly accommodated at Khyber Pass  High chair; check  Superb rice  the pudding and soup were beautifully done  and I really enjoyed my lamb shank  I have walked by this place many times on my way to Au Pied du Cochin   I now wish I had come here instead  Nice  Comforting and reasonably priced ,positive,6018382
The store manager Jovan  has the best customer service Ive seen thus far Friendly but professional   as for the other workers they dont seem to be enthusiastic about working  Ive never wanted to spend money in a establishment I was stressed about a quote I got from the Honda dealer Mr Hines sad he will take care of me and he did just that   having car trouble just ask for him you cant go wrong,positive,5026764

This place rocks!! Think of a barista for your pizza! You can make it however you want and if you screw it up by being too adventurous with toppings theyll remake it for free!! The general manager is excellent   Hes involved with his crew and his guests and was so personable and sincere that we loved our pizzas!! And we did! Deeeelish and excellent service  Cant ask for more  Only criticism which is for corporate: please bring back ricotta !!!,positive,5536008
Came here on a Saturday evening  highly recommend reservations  Around 6 ish it was getting pretty packed  The meats    to die for    all the steaks from top sirloin  prime rib  flank steak  filet mignon was all tender and flavoured perfectly  Just thinking about it    is making me drool  The chicken was also tender and moist and the lamb chops are a must try  The shrimps was okay  and the salad bar and hot bar wasnt the greatest  Not very fresh and not much variety  I would definitely come back for the meats  just amazing  At the end of the night they gave us a 15% off on the next visit but its only valid for 7 days which is kind of ridiculous     they should extend that ,positive,664716
I thought his tricks were better than Penn and Tellers although they were trying to be funny  Steve was a bit more on the unintentional comedy level   I dont want spoil it for anyone that hasnt seen it but I did enjoy the show and would take friends again (w/ free tickets)   I also thought the dancers were kinda lame My wife and I were impressed w/ the production of this show seeing as most shows at PH are on a shoestring budget ,positive,2632750

Im typically a fan!However i tend to do self checkout because i ALWAYS get stuck bagging my own groceries if i dont do self checkout  I cant watch what your ringing up if im having to bag my own stuff  And it always seems as if there is a bagger just standing around talking/texting while i do it  and they tend to just disappear when its my turn     i dont get this one! And yet managers stand there and just look at me while i bag    so frustrating However last night was horrible! I ran in quickly to get 2 newspapers and seen the christmas stuff was on sale  I found a bag of candy and asked the gal if she could tell me how much it was  She rang it up and it was 3 99  i asked if it was on sale still and she tells me how am i supposed to know enter your card number then i can tell you  Really? I could not believe the attitude  i believe she was upset because I interupted her hugging on a guy who was visiting her while she was working    Sorry its called a job!,neutral,3169512
On our annual family getaway to Vegas  the wife & I always try to take our 3 kids (ages 9 6 4) to enjoy some fine dining  This time it was Craftsteak for the Chef selection  What a treat  with 2 domestic wagyu steaks & 1 Double R grade steak which included  starter  salad  sides  & 5 different dessert offerings  We had 5 30p seating and restaurant wasnt too busy but as the night progressed with larger parties it was quite loud  which is better with kids  Overall we had a nice time with great food & very attentive service  There was southern couple that were seated across from us  the wife & I were on high alert in case the kids started to fuss but it worked out  the kids got a bit antsy but overall behaved for the meal  After they were done & headed to their show  the nice couple complimented on the kids behavior  So as parents  we were all smiles  Thank you  So for all the parents who would like to enjoy some fine dining in Vegas with the kids  you can do it!!!!!!,positive,4044332

When it comes to an honest  knowledgeable and fairly priced shop that specializes in Mercedes and BMW  no one in town beats the guys down at German Motors behind the fashion show mall I found this place through AAA  when searching for a shop to get my mothers 78  450SL fixed  After an incident at Fletcher Jones  I swore I would find someone better  more knowledgeable and not out to screw me out of every last $$ I had in my wallet  The gang down at German Motors were able to address all my issues in a very timely manner and told me the real truth of what was going on with the car  the cost and most importantly  that they could fix it pretty quickly So remember fellow yelpers  if you own a BMW or MBZ that is out of warranty  stay away from the over priced dealers and head down to German motors!,positive,6356293

I went in for a pedicure  what I got was not what I signed up for  I upgraded my pedicure to the luxury  Nothing luxurious about what I got  The massage was terrible  and lasted about 1 minute  The stones he rubbed on my legs served no purpose  But put all that aside  okay the foot scrub was good and the water temp was very nice and warm  Things took a turn for the worst when the technician cut my toe  When it wouldnt stop bleeding he poured nail polish remover on it  for some misguided reason he believed acetone was good for my bleeding wound  Now Im bleeding  stinging  and burning   I want to get out of there and finally he finishes  The nail polish looks fine  but he did not do a good job cleaning up the polish around my toes  Fortyfive minutes later Im paying and he has the audacity to charge me full price and ask for a tip  Its poor business practice in my opinion to screw up your job and blame the customer for it ,negative,2804551
Did the 9 30 show on a Monday night  Really enjoyed it overall  Definitely adult  There is nudity  But quite funny  There is a lot of crowd interaction for the lower seats  The performers are quite impressive  Better than most of the Vegas shows  Try getting the tickets cheaper at tix4less  Definitely worth it!,positive,879675

Gangster Burger      what a great name  With such a cool name they should have an awesome burger    so I thought  Maybe my expectations got the better of me (I love a good burger)  but the experience was mediocre  Nothing special about the burger    which makes it not worth the money  Service wasnt great either and you cant really eat inside There is too much burger competition for being this mediocre ,neutral,1316137
Love speciality grocery stores  as I frequent Earthfare & Fresh Market  but I was a little disappointed will the limited selection here  Although everything I did purchase was great  I still had to go another store to get some salad items  vegetables  etc   Overall  I will be back for speciality items  like wine & their desserts ,neutral,3485278
I lived in SF for three years  so Im a bit spoiled in terms of dim sum  Went here for dinner with my family for some dim sum  We ordered one of everything of the dumplings  They didnt seem super fresh (frozen?) and were just ok  The dumplings were a bit on the small side and overpriced for sure  Maybe next time well just do regular Americanized Chinese food  Service was fast and friendly  teapot refilled several times  water glasses never empty for long  The decor is trippy  but fun and different  Overall  pricey     And I dont like it when restaurants have fish tanks and you can see dead fish  I was looking for them  so maybe thats not fair  but still ,neutral,2370745
Nice signs for healthy  organic  detox   walk in and signs says now serving bud light  My bad for not walking out then  Ordered a breakfast sandwich combo  Got charged twice for my coffee  Another testament to their healthy vibe   mini moos for creamer  Get my breakfast sandwich and its missing the turkey bacon I added on and its served on a white English muffin  My bad again for assuming that a healthy cafe would serve a whole wheat muffin instead a of a white one  Maybe my standards are too high but I expect more than mini moos and a white English muffin from a healthy cafe ,negative,3892627

This was my first time here and oh my deliciousness! I ordered the TNT roll which had spicy tuna and crab  topped with scallops and a spicy mayo sauce for only $10 and some change!  Im still salivating from that roll  I also got a dragon roll that had really fresh avocado and then the crunch roll that contained crab  both scrumptious  The prices are really decent and you do get complimentary miso soup and/or salad which is a nice surprise  The staff was very friendly and fast  The restaurant itself is very clean and has a giant fish tank along one of the walls  I will definitely be back!,positive,5632620
We ate here with another couple on a Saturday night   It was great that they take reservations as the place was soon packed   And loud   Very   The menu seemed pretty limited  The sandwiches ordered  a fancy hamburger and a blacked chicken special  looked and tasted great   The chicken wings were average   And the fish tacos were disappointing  tortillas seemed old  slaw was dry and plain  meager sauce   The service was fine  however  Our feeling was that it is more of a bar than restaurant and that we probably wont go back ,negative,5954952

The food was really good and quite inexpensive for the portion size   The crispy shrimp wontons in particular were really great   The food all came out quickly  too The service  however  was pretty tepid   The lad working as host/busboy when we came in clearly did not want to be there   The young lady who served us was much better  but was mostly absent during our meal   The water glasses we were brought were dirty  and our water was only refilled once Id definitely order food from there again  but given this experience it would have to be takeout ,negative,4888605
So disappointed! We were not greeted when we came into the lobby  there were no towels by the pool  in fact we had to ask 3 times for towels! The front desk staff were rude and looked like they could give a s*** less about being there  my group and I were most upset about happy hour prices not being given to us at the pool  we would have spent so much more money had they let us get a pitcher of margarita at the pool  instead we went to the grocery store and made our own I probably will not come back,negative,4491452

I travel to Glendale on work  and found this place as a blessing  I tried pretty much everything on their menu (in Chicken and vegetarian)  and liked almost all the items  My favorites are Chole Bhatura  BnB Special Dosa  Bezawada Biryani  and Samosa chat  I would have eaten each of these items at least 10 times and they never disappointed  Staff is very friendly and made me feel home  Thank you guys and keep up the good work!,positive,2647043
The only reason this place got more than one star was because of Pam Higgins  She did such a fantastic job  with what she was given to provide everyone with what they wanted in light of pool/bowling/ping pong aspect  What a kind soul  Made the experience worth it and she is the only reason Id return  If she were to get this message  Thank you Pam  The world needs more people like you ,negative,4944344

Stopped into Thor for a quick Americano  The space is pretty small  but lovely  Per Joe H s review  I was THORoughly impressed with the large mural on the wall with the Espresso Tamper Further  the customdesigned espresso machine with Thor wings was equally as awesome We enjoyed a latte and americano outside on the small patio they have on the side  Given the chilling weather these days  I dont think patio days can last much longer past October  I would definitely come back here if I found myself in the King/Bathurst area!,positive,4620952
I found this place because of Yelp   I was in the area and hungry and checked out the map on yelp to figure out where to eat  and this place popped up   Without yelp  I would have never found the place!  The entrance is not at street level so its not easily seen   But thank you yelp  this place was great!  Portion was HUGE and price was cheap!

Not a bad little place to go for lunch   They have pretty good food and decent prices   Ive only been there a couple of times but both times had good service and left satisfied   Not really else to say   pretty standard bar and grill     Give it a try   chances are youll like it ,positive,3916118
I want to give this place more stars  but I was a bit disappointed  I want to start buy saying I was expecting a wave pool and a lazy river  I really should have done my research better     Upon checking in the valet was friendly and attentive  They quickly brought our stuff to our room  When we arrived to the room we where looking for storage space  And there was only one tiny dresser in the closet  Wtf  So we had to keep our clothes in our bags (3 people we were staying 3 days) the bathroom are strange the door is a sliding door that is connected to the closet and there is no privacy you can hear everything  Also the shower is clear glass  So if someone has to wash  their hands or go potty you have to wait  No coffee maker  Room service is only available 6am2pm really??? Menu options arent great over priced fruit bowl 16 $ no thank you  Pool was ok  Not to crowded  but I think it wasnt crowded because the pool is lame  I rather stay somewhere els ,negative,2692192

We live close to Monsoon Thai and enjoy going there for dinner occasionally   In the evening there is seldom a crowd  maybe just a few other tables  We find the service is ALWAYS prompt and friendly   We went recently and I ordered one of the specials  Soft Shell Crab in red curry sauce  I have to say it was the best dish I have ever had there   There were 3 crabs  all fried perfectly in a very light crisp batter   Plenty of vegetables  peppers  broccoli  squash  corn  snow peas in a nice light curry sauce   I had enough left over to take to lunch the next day   We also ordered the  Mee Krob as an appetizer for 2  enough for a meal in itself   We have always enjoyed our meals here  but this was something special   They have spruced the interior up with some new furnishings and the place looks much nicer   My only suggestion here is to LOSE all the plastic plants and maybe change the wall color from Maroon to something lighter  more updated and appealing to the eye ,positive,6062138

I miss you IG! I didnt realize how hard it is to find a good Indian Restaurant  until I left Pittsburgh  I usually went for the half off deals for an early (4pm6pm) or really late (after 9:30 or 10   i forget) dinner  My favorite dishes were chicken korma  palak paneer and chicken biryani  During the day  they also have a buffet for $8  If you go on a Saturday they serve this fried bread  really tasty  IG has the most and best selections for lunch buffet  It even includes a good variety of desserts   My mouth is salivating just thinking about it  The owner and waiters are really nice too ,positive,2479344

I mean lets be real  is it the best place    No it isnt  but I dont exaggerate my reviews   The room is okay and the washroom is dated   Some of the walls are peeling and some of the shades have holes in them   However the bed is comfortable   The front desk lady was super nice and we were very easily checked in   Its the quality inn people   Its not the Bellagio or The Ritz Carlton    It ranks on the same level as all other 3 star hotels   Expect exactly what you would and you will get that   Expect anymore you will be disappointed   Id stay here again if it was just simply to rest for the night ,neutral,2475725

Im in the MME industry and finally decided to check this place out  I live in mountains edge so its nearby  Options are okay but limited  they dont have a daily menu posted anywhere  wait time was ridiculous  to pay you have to sit and wait to be called up  no local discount  no industry discount  and the entire experience took extremely way to long  With so many other great dispensaries (LIKE ESSENCE) why would you go here? First and last visit for me ,negative,2925558
Just awful  Inequitable guest experience; meat carvers didnt come around nearly as often as guests who got seated after us and coincidentally seated right next to us  Got the manager involved and while he was nice  my guest and I were fed up and decided to leave ,negative,3322712
I went here with my wife and I was very anxious to try this since I had heard it was better than Culvers   I thought it was okay   I got a Triple Burger and still thought it was too small   the frys were okay   personally too thin for me   I dont know  maybe I was comparing it too much too Culvers    Culvers was better because it filled me up   had more flavor and it was more greasy   So  in conclusion   I liked Culvers more but Freddys is healthier ,negative,2802838
This is a bit overdue review  I went to get my eyebrows waxed here  Ive been here before  but the one time I went the lady waxed off part of my eyelashes I was really pissed  The lady felt bad and they reimbursement me by having me come in and get fake eyelashes that I had issues with because in the beginning it didnt stay on  there was nothing to catch on to  The lady who takes appointments is very rude she once told me that we have paying and other customers first when I had to make an appointment and couldnt come in at the time she wanted me to  I said really you ripped my eyelashes off show me some respect  I would never go back ,negative,5202836

Planted in the heart of the district between NY NY  Monte Carlo  and TMobile arena  Beerhaus has a bar/street food causal dining environment thats good for the whole family   Games are on the family style picnic benches so you can hang out and spend some quality time with the family or watch a game with some friends while you enjoy a cold beverage   However  one catch  the waiter/waitress can only get your drink order   Youll need to stand in line to order food like at a fast food joint  but theyll bring the food over to you   Not sure still how this lands on me  but I guess its their operating model   Food is still worth experiencing if you find yourself early and waiting for a concert or sporting event at Tmobile ,positive,4213154

Is it odd that i find the free bread was the most amazing thing i ate? The housemade butter was delicious and I was tempted to smuggle some home with me  The staff was super helpful and even gave us bread and butter to go  We started out with beignets  nice and hot with lots of cinnamon sugar on them  I ordered the truite grenobloise which was very rich  I couldve done without the head on it though  It was served with cauliflower and croutons on top  I would definitely visit their bakery in the Venetian next time ,positive,3198797

Ive been here a couple times before but never when they opened 4 floors of merchandise   Theres a lot of souvenirs to choose from but they need more employees to walk around to check up on people   My husband saw a lady filling up her drink cup with M & Ms   Most of the employees were at the cashier or just randomly standing at the same place passing out bags for people to put their items in   We bought 2 medium size M & Ms and that saved us a couple dollars  rather than buying just 1   (I have 2 kids ),neutral,2994656

Lousy food  lousy service  The area is a ghetto  homeless people all around  Walls and buildings loaded with graffiti and garbage dumped all over   Lunch time much safer   but you can see and smell the dirt and dirty air  Inside seems like just a quick cosmetic fix up  The food is MICROWAVED  The soup and tea is MICROWAVED   Area is a dump  homeless live over the dirty wall  and on the other side as well as above side near entrance to Veggie house  Place is disgusting and homeless need to be taken care of  Homeless Are living in Filthy conditions  Its sickening  and it feels like the filth permeated inside Veggie house  everything is dirty  Conditions all around deplorable  Turns your stomach to eat  The food is unhealthy microwaved  Everything here is Bad!

Atmosphere was AMAZING!came here last night with 5 of my coworkers  some of us have ate here and the others no  I  Myself have never been here so it was a fun new place to try  Im always use to eatting at Saketini or Ra Sushi I ordered Calamari as an appetizer  I was not a big fan of the deep fried   Ive had better  However their dark dipping sauce was delicious!!!! It had a kick of chili in it  exactly what it needed  The shrimp tempura and Lotus roll The Lotus roll was good  a little too seafoody for me   I loved the lobster but I just couldnt bare the smell (Dumb huh? Im only in a sushi place) but whatever my body is weird like that  HahaDillon was our waiter  I kept giving him a hard time but it was all good fun  He was great! I would reccommend and request him to the hostesses if possible!ALL in ALL  great place,positive,377277
Large selection of items offered on their AYCE menu  Fish is fresh and presented nicely  Their sushi is a little smaller than other places though but Im not complaining  On my last visit  I noticed the new addition of aburi/torched sushi on their menu as well  Their cooked items are done well  Food comes promptly and I dont feel they arbitrarily change your sashimi orders or lose your food orders  Service is decent and theres always one lady that whisks away the empty plates the moment you take the last piece of sushi  Parking is a nightmare most of the time and theres always a line  Call ahead to reserve a table (but youll still have to wait a little bit at the door)  Well priced for the quality and service offered ,positive,3393427

I am surprised this place has such bad reviews  Yes  theyre a tad bit expensive compared to the everything is $3 places  BUT your whites stay white and your clothing doesnt come back smelling like chemicals   Everything Ive given them ~ from wine stains on silk to some sort of grease on linen  came out   Furthermore I did comparisons of prices and their prices when compared to other cleaners who dont offer super cheap specials   they are not overpriced  My dearest uses a cheaper place and I hate how my clothing smells   I also hate that every white/light piece of clothing yellows   NOT with Pressed  For what I spend on my clothes  its worth it to have them cleaned properly ,positive,1882480

Unlike the cafe rio in Avondale  the tortillas are always doughy  sticky and underdone here  never flaky and crispy like nearby Avondales; I couldnt even eat them!  The tortilla makers here must have fallen asleep during class   Theres never enough seating and the staff are unfamiliar with how the other Cafe Rios serve their food! I came the last time during when no one was here at 4pm and they were out of guacamole & cilantro and the seats/tables were dirty!  They charge extra for dressing & fresca here unlike Avondale   The only thing that is right is the cutlery and condiments counter is always stocked   Tried it 4 times  unlikely coming back ,negative,5769020
1 star solely due to the service  Walked in around 4 PM on a Thursday and it was completely empty  There was only one worker and she was sitting at a table on her phone (thats fine!) but as me and my boyfriend went to look at the menu she got up and starting cussing/yelling on the phone  Immediately walked out as I did not want to deal with an angry person  Note she clearly saw us walk in and knew we were in there  UPDATE: Tried Pita Bistro again and it was a great experience! The employees were very welcoming and the food was great! Definitely recommend this place ,positive,28733

Came here right after a long night of drinking    I guess thats not the best idea to rate food by since drinking then eating makes things taste a tad better  With everything they had in this sandwich  I would be too scared to eat it sober P We ordered their corned beef & cheese topped with french fries  coleslaw and tomatoes  Onion on request Their corned beef was tender  but I cant say it was the best tasting  but good  The fries were fresh and surprisingly not salty and the coleslaw was good  The combination all in a sandwichperfect  Now after a long day or long night  this should be the way to finish off the night  Very filling and satisfying 24 hours makes it even better ),positive,669208

We have had SRP electric since 1973 and are very pleased with the service and rates (lower than APS and a fraction of what we had been paying to the Cleveland Electric Illuminating company before moving to AZ)  They gave us $30 cash to haul away our old fridge a couple of years ago and have many programs to help the environment  We paid a small deposit to start our electric service in 1973 and that was refunded to us the next year and we have never had to pay another deposit (in spite of 3 changes of residence over the years) Our electric bill today is about the same as when we moved into this Tempe home in 1987  Why? Armed with information from SRP  we added sun screens to the windows  have more energy efficient appliances  and our 1987 air conditioner was 8SEER and our current ac is 16SEER  No  we do NOT work for SRP  but appreciate that cost per KWH is lower in SRP served areas than almost anywhere else in the US ,positive,6045892

I generally enjoy eating at this place despite being somewhat unpredictable on quality  The decor is minimal  ambiance is relaxed and service is friendly  quite similar to other Friendly Thai restaurants in the city  Overall  its just another (slightly expensive  I would take a toonie off each main dish) Thai restaurant; nothing distinctive to write home about ,positive,2073715
People in Calgary LOVE LOVE LOVE breakfast   That is why Ive never understood why no one in this city knows about Kanes Harley Diner   Admittedly  Im last the last person you would find any where near a Harley  but this is my favourite place to grab a breakfast   It is never too busy  but there are always just enough people around to make your experience interesting   The service is reliable and fast   That probably comes from the fact that the staff there are lifers and are good at their jobs I dont experiment much when it comes to breakfast  I like the traditional fare with eggs  bacon and toast   And this diner nails each and every time   You are going to be scared to be walk in the doors  but once you do  youll be happy as a Hells Angel getting out of jail!,positive,4184517
I want to add a postscript on to my previous review   I recently had Robco Electric install 17 solar panels on my second home   The planning and preparation for the install was completed without a hitch; thanks to Kyle Jones  the sales rep   Since the installation was completed a few months ago  the electric bill has dropped down to an average of only $14 a month   For any homeowner who may be wondering which company you should go to when it comes to solar  I would strongly recommend Robco Electric  They are family owned business and has been in Las Vegas for many years  They are very honest  trustworthy  and will treat you right    Richard M   (Very Satisfied Customer) ,positive,2691082
I made a reservation on 1:00 PM but I had to wait 40 minutes  The hostess seemed to be very upset about something  May be Groupon About food Oyster  small and not fresh Lobster Tail  some good  some bad  I ate 8 though same as Filet Mignon some cooked perfect but some over cooked Dessert  Delicious  Almost everything  Crepe was simple and tasty Server was good  He refilled our champagne all the time  Dont need to ask The table was dirty  There was stain on it Around 2:30 PM  they stopped refill the food so I only had 50 minutes to enjoy this expensive buffet I saw many great reviews  May be it depends on day  Today was so crowded I used Groupon btw ,neutral,2472079
are an all you can eat place  They were offering $20 all you can eat  but their normal Price is $25 99  We jumped on the opportunity to try the place one because of the price and two because they offered alot of non sushi things since my husband is not a sushi person  The revolving track has it so you can sit at a booth  bar stool type and also in front of sushi chefs  The selection of sushi was good and small like tappas style  Everything was fresh and appitizing  Loved how it was a different take on the revolving sushi place Id been before  It was really busy that night so staff was a little hard to get service from  But overall was happy with the place and would definitely go back ,positive,6558113
Yummy!  I had a great visit here I ordered the lemon ricotta pancakes and when I took my first bite I heard Angeles singing!  Yes they are that good  lemony creamy goodness in every bite   My husband had the egg breakfast with spam he was doing the happy dance  The waitress was very helpful and friendly sorry I forgot your name or I would have given you a shout out   The hubby also got a side of pancakes Instead of the potatoes which were light and fluffy (cinnamon bun pancakes) and cooked to perfection  I will definitely come back!,positive,6546892
Not to be missed! Just fantastic! (See my pix  words cant do it justice ) Street parking can be tough  but it is doable  If not  plenty of paid parking  Friday and Saturday night are the biggest  Great for people watching or just mingling with other Vegas devotees and tourists  Every night there are free concerts and entertainers  The hourly overhead projection show is very nice ,positive,3951407

With its location near smack dab the heart of The Strip  and so many excellent and reasonably priced hotels nearby  its plain to see why so many gravitate towards the area  regardless of the time of day ,positive,5409105
This is still the gold standard for burgers in the Valley for me   The Tijuana Torpedo is my go to  although Ive had all their burgers   They throw green chilis on their WOOD FIRE pit and grill them  before placing a fresh patty of beef which has pepper jack cheese pounded into it  and then throw hot sauce on it (which is not really hot  its more of a chulula type thing)   Its freakin huge  and its so good because of the method of cooking with the wood   You pick your own fixins and then sit down in a cool saloonish vibed place and just enjoy your burger   I live in Scottsdale and will trek down to Tempe just to get it sometimes   Yeah  its THAT good ,positive,5326395
Very disappointed  Showed Fran a picture of what I wanted    shoulder length with face framing layers  Ended up with a jaw length bob   which I absolutely hate  Wanted 8 inches cut off to donate & she cut 12 inches off  I even gave her a tape measure so she would cut it to the right length  Will definitely not be going back ,negative,5813024
I called one week ago to schedule a thorough spring cleaning  I was given a morning appointment time  The service did not show up on time  I called when they were an hour late  and was told that they called me last night to change my appointment time  I told them that I did not receive the message Next  I was told that they would be at my house within 15  30 minutes  Still no show  I finally get a phone call from them 2 and 1/2 hours after they were supposed to be here  saying that they were on their way  All the while I sat here waiting for them  I told them not to bother coming and that they should check with the customer as to what time the customer needs them to come  not what time they want to come  I work the afternoon shift and cannot afford to have someone show up late or when they want to  I think this company provides poor customer service and I wont be calling them again!,negative,1916989
My wife and I werent planning on eating here but she is health conscious and once she saw the menu in the window  the decision was made  Fresh salads mixed to order  sandwiches freshly made  and the lobster bisque soupexcellent  Everyone was nice and everything was prepared quick  The chocolate dipped strawberries are a nice touch and everything was a good value By the way  had Jasons Deli a week later and they  were almost as good  But maybe I wasnt butthurt and looking for a reason to make them better ,positive,3836723
The WhichWich style of HotDog orders  this place packs a solid frank  The sweet potato fries are recommended and the portion is fairly large  At the end of the day  I had trouble paying nearly $10 for a hot dog  fries  and a drink; especially when Costco is right down the road and its $1 65 for a dog and drink  If I want a Fancy Dog  Id recommend Short Leash Dogs in Phoenix  Unfortunately  theyre not out on the west side!I plan to go back and try a couple different options ,neutral,4759543

I called on a sunday about 1 5 hours before they closed to see if I could get in for a full set and pedicure  was able to walk right in  I got the deluxe pedicure which was great!

We ordered my birthday cake from Freeds and did everything through the phone  I cannot put into words how beautiful this cake was  It was AWESOME! Thank you Jennifer  When we ate it  again it was FANTASTIC!  The cake was everything I wanted for my birthday  The icing was 50/50 and was light tasting and not sickening sweet  The roses looked real but were not  We sent them an image we wanted on the cake and it was great  They added butterflies and 2 large fondant numbers for my age  It was absolutely beautiful  We also used the Yelp offer to receive 6 free cookies and they were yummy  I highly recommend Freeds to anyone who is looking for that special cake and/or cookies  The only downfall is the price  It was expensive  The total for an 8 inch cake was over $100  Most cakes of this size run around $25$30   However  for all we got I gladly paid the price  I considered it a piece of Art ,positive,6084544
I will not be going back to Bluewater Grill   This is my second visit   The first time wasnt so great  so I decided not to write a review until I had given it a second chance I went through the photos of food and made some decisions in advance   I hoped to avoid disappointment by picking things that I had seen and I knew looked delicious  My food was not delicious   It was soggy and did not taste fresh   The spongey watery texture and flavor tasted like it had been frozen   In every photo  one dish was served with a fresh cilantro sauce atop a salad of cucumber and cabbage slaw   Mine was supposed to come with watercress and peppers in a burre blanc sauce   No sauce  no watercress  just a few strips of pepper   in addition  the dish had been created using a less desirable parts   I would expect that of a lesser establishment  but not from a place that charges upward of $25 per entree ,negative,2842396

Just wanted to express my appreciation for this hotel! I had my second stay here yesterday (a year a part from each other) and it was just as good as the first  Very consistent! I didnt have a chance to hit up the main pool last time I was here  and really enjoyed lounging at the Boulevard pool this goround  It was chill  but still lively and had decent music (surprised us  as we are both snobs and my bf is a dj haha)  The people were great too  Good vibes  Great hot tub also!Special thank you to host Michael for the incredible view from our 1 bedroom terrace  It truly made my boyfriends first time in Vegas very special  See you soon!,positive,3357494
I went for my second time to the Ultimate Cafe this weekend and I have to say that I had a great brunch there!First off  the brunch menu is fairly large for this smaller restaurant  Secondly  the food is yummy and definitely left me and the group I was with very satisfied And lastly  the prices were reasonable I had an eggwhite omelette with spinach and feta cheese  paired with a side of potato hashbrowns and four pieces of whole wheat toast with butter and jam My boyfriend had an amazing breakfast sandwich  which was stacked with a huge egg  cheese and veggies I believe Overall  the bill for 5 people  including 4 coffees  was $70  This is around $14 per person And although the cafe is fairly plain looking inside  it has a nice openconcept interior  which allows fresh air and sunshine to tiptoe in during nice summer days  This is great because you get it either way  patio seats or no patio seats ,neutral,2790541

Super cute  aesthetic patio and little restaurant/bar  My husband got the Smuttynose FinestKind IPA  I got Roku Riesling (very sweet  desert wine which I love)  We both loved our drinks!! Charcuterie (make your own cheese and meat plate) was amazing  We got the spicy sausage  goat cheese  and sharp cheddar  It comes with some garlic toasts  which were delicious  The Earl Flatbread is spicy and we split it  which was enough food for us with the cheese plate to start  We couldnt finish it and had to take some home!Delicious!!!!,positive,6136182

I was referred here for emergency overnight care for my dog  The staff was very friendly from the moment I walked thru the door  The vet on site (Cant remember her name) was very compassionate and gave me multiple options for my dog and explained things to me very patiently given the fact that I was distraught and confused  I ended up having to put my dog to sleep and everyone was so sensitive and sympathetic to my daughter and me  My daughter was extremely emotional  All the staff sent us a sympathy card a few days later which was very kind and unexpected  Even after picking up his remains  they still handled with care and gave condolences multiple times  If I have another pet and need emergency care I will definitely come back here ,positive,2757926

Was walking the strip when I saw this place  Ohh Pinks! Thats that famous hot dog spot in LA where all the celebrities go and people line up for 2 hours to get a hot dog! Situated right in front of Planet Hollywood  I knew I just to get one of those wonderful meats encased in tube form  as Anthony Bourdain would say   lol  The place itself is really small  you order  slide down to the left to pick up your food  and theres an outdor patio where you can eat  Theres a quite extensive menu including not only hotdogs but burgers as well and a myriad of toppings   the most familiar being chili and cheese to the exotic of avocado and sour cream  I went with the planet hollywood dog  A polish sausage with grilled mushrooms  onions  cheese  and bacon  It was hearty and delicious  A lil pricey at around $8 but I think it was worth it    will definitely be checking out other menu offerings the next time Im in Vegas!,positive,5931861
do not miss the amazing small / appetizer dishes    some of the best things on the menu! foie gras  prepared to perfection  and the Ahi on a salt slab    seriously good stuff  also agree the tortilla soup is not to be missed  cowboy singing in the cactus garden on sunday night  wonderful i would also say the menu pricing is reasonable for the quality of the food and preparation ,positive,6569749
I was able to schedule a same day appointment at a time convenient for me  Erin was absolutely amazing  She styled my hair exactly how I requested  The front desk girls were also very sweet  If I didnt live in California  Id definitely come back here!,positive,2706376
I can see why this place has such good reviews and is booked out so often!We arrived at 5pm for an early dinner without a booking  We were seated immediately and had the table available til 7  which suited us as we were off to a show  The staff were polite and very efficient  Our water was topped up after a few sips every time! The food was absolutely delicious  Very well presented  cooked perfectly and authentic  dynamic  balanced flavors  The venue is well stocked with wines and very ambient and cosy  A great location for romantic dates  but also popular for larger parties  The waitresses were very attentive and made sure we were happy with everything  This restaurant is a surprising and impressive hidden gem in Summerlin!We cant wait to eat here again and will be taking our visiting families here soon also ,positive,1957169
Still thinking about their unexpectedly fab sweet potato and bacon salad  Im a fan of their eggs benny  bacon and gingerbread pancakes  The staff and owners are great  love their 70s radio selection too ,positive,4596128
We loved our Greek salad   the dressing was very zesty     I had the chicken pita which was typical of a standard gyro  Now my guest had the lamb gyro which she said was moist and tasted amazing compared to any other she ever had  The staff was very nice and took time to educate us on the menu  It would be nice if there were pictures because everything sounds yummy!At about 615pm the place became packed and people were waiting to be seated Overall a good experience and we will be back  he best dressing I have had   Our gyros one lamb and one chicken were moist and flavorful   Highly recommend!,positive,6074062
Sprouts in general is a great store  This location is no different  They seem to have the best produce in terms of variety  freshness  quality and price  The meat department also has some shockingly good deals at times  The rest of the store offers a lot of natural and organic products at very competitive prices  Gluten free flour for less than I would spend to buy it on Amazon com! The store is clean  location is convenient and parking is ample  What more could one ask?,positive,4568170
Tessios Pizza is one of my favorites in the valley   It is by no means gourmet  but it hits the spot every time   They have a thin crust  decent sauce  and is always just greasy enough :)  Their sandwiches and sides are good as well ,positive,4705866
i first had smashburger in its hometown of Denver  CO  it was heavenly  so delicious with just the right amount of grease  tasty fries too!well  i was sorely disappointed to discover that we didnt have any here in AZ  then one day  while driving  i saw the building for this one but they werent open yet  so  i thought that i would check and see how many actually were in the valley  there was another close by that we went to a couple of times  but really we were just waiting for this one to open!ive been there with Matthew 3 times and my mom once  im sorry to say that its not really been better than mediocre  the burgers are overly greasy and the fries are too  their soda fountain is delicious however i usually get the bbq bacon burger with the bbq on the side  with petal sauce for my smashfries  this time i added a side of smash sauce  i still dont know if i liked it or not  it was very odd i will go here again  but i think ill try the chicken as ive been meaning to ,neutral,6590428
We were so excited to try out this place given all the positive reviews and hype   But we were very disappointed   The prices are a lot higher than youre led to believe   And the food left a huge lump in my belly   Wasnt feeling too good the rest of the night   I think it was those fried cheese curds   They were a party in my mouth going down but I paid for it later   Didnt even get to try the ice cream because the bill for a family of 5 was already $50 ,neutral,6171348
Love this place  The food is just incredibly tasty  I wish I could eat here every day but is not that cheap  It is not expensive either  You get what you pay for and this place gives you the best plates for fair prices  I recommend everyone to try Lindo Michoacan if you havent yet ,positive,3532886

I have always been fascinated by titanic and I couldnt wait to see this exhibit  I was not disappointed  I loved seeing the artifacts and loved the solemn way the set was arranged  No fancy las vegas style lights or cheesyness  Very respectful  My fav part of course  was the grand staircase  I had not read any reviews before i went in Aug 08  so I have no idea  that was in there  I loved standing there and taking the tourist pic  Dont judge me  I thought it was 2 cool  As I am planning to get married in Vegas next year  I plan to hop back to the exhibit (thats now @ Luxor) and take another pic in my wedding dress on the staircase with my husband  Cant wait  Def a must see ,positive,2182479
Three Dog Bakery is the best! The owners are very nice and they have fun events like an Easter egg hunt  pet blessing  photos with Frosty  Rudolph  Easter Bunny  etc  throughout the year  We go to Three Dog for our dogs birthday cake each year  They have different flavors to choose from (peanut butter  carrot  carob) and our dog loves his cakes! They also have other cute dog bakery treats too and a nice selection of different flavored and sized raw hides ,positive,5665057

I am a big fan of CZ  I dont like this particular location though  I know that they just opened but I am not impressed  I am from Utah and the one up there is on point  The service here is not very good  They skimp on the ingredients and its not very fresh  I am hoping to come back in a few weeks and give this location another shot  At the current time I can only justify a 2 star rating ,negative,1842383
Lou is so awesome!  Such a great guy   I take my oldest son here and he loves it too   Lou is honest  so if you cant handle the fact that your child is not the genius you think  they are or want them to be  then I would look elsewhere   Lou is genuinely looking at helping your child to succeed and does not use scare tactics to get you to sign up for multiple tutoring sessions   10 stars for Lou!,positive,3466874

i want to say that i loved innout  but unfortunately  the burger was good on an empty stomach  and the fries were mediocre  We asked for them well done  and they still seemed undercooked  I cant see how people compare it to shake shack  as both have completely different styles  shake shack is more of a gourmet burger compared to innout  but innout is more reasonable priced for a burger  I dont think i would crave their burgers or fries  but i would have it if we happened to be near one and wanted a quick bite ,neutral,6596652
I have been to this location twice now  Both times the service was good and the food came fast   I read the reviews prior to coming the first time  It appears that people have only complained about everything  which is why I am writing this review  We got exactly what we ordered  and had zero issues with the taste of our food ,positive,2231966

We found this wonderful little restaurant on our first trip to Cleveland three years ago  and weve been back every year since  Very good food with special attention to good wine; easily as good as restaurants costing vastly more  We love leisurely fine dining  and have never never felt rushed here  On our most recent visit we were able to enjoy all the courses by splitting each one; the kitchen did this very nicely for us  The recommended wine turned out to be excellent and modestly priced  The only damper was a snotty waitress who insisted on correcting my pronunciation of all the menu items  On past visits we found the service to be excellent and friendly  so well be back on our next Cleveland trip ,positive,5996025
Treated myself to spa day & a 50 minute massage  I loved the energy here  Melissa made me very comfortable and provided an excellent massage  The wet area and saunas were very nice and clean  my only complaint is that the pool could be better maintained as the tile felt dirty  But everything else was delightful ,positive,5715993
You want to know whats fucking bullshit?Lilis not being close enough to where we live  thats what This place is awesome  way more awesome than most coffee spots  Every now and then youll see these lists created by some selfproclaimed knowitall who names the top 10 15 20 must go to coffee shops in Pittsburgh and these goofballs seem to forget about Lilis  The place makes great coffee  serves great food for the price and provides a cozy atmosphere that is super fucking kid friendly The little bastards have their own little kid cave filled with cool kid shit The staff and clientele are good people  the kind of people you dont have to fight the constant urge to prevent yourself from punching them in the face repeatedly   Even though we reside in greenfield for now  we still make the trip on a fairly regular basis P S  Good sturdy chairs they have ,positive,6531493
My new favorite Indian restaurant!!!

I will never stay here again  I arrived at 1030 pm   It is now 1208am and I have still not even reached the front to check in! The line continues to grow longer and yet they only have 1 register for the regular check in line  They cater to their VIP checking them in right away one after the other before even looking at the massive line forming in their casino  Worst experience ever! Will NOT stay here again ,negative,2841898

This place was really cool  The stained glass windows behind the bar are breathtaking  Great drinks  The house fish punch was refreshing and deadly  I will be ordering it again  Love the ice cubes  The staff was very friendly and knowledgeable  The owners obviously put a lot of work into renovating what used to be a dirtcovered basement of what was once an abandoned building and obviously never used for anything  The original beams add to the ambiance  The bathroom doors are unreal  It took me a second to figure out how to use it  which then made me laugh  I felt transported to an oldworld pub or Ratskeller in Europe  Great vibe ,positive,5559543

You have to go there because its an institution  you just have to   I normally dont eat fried chicken  but that was the most amazing fried chicken ever   the waffles had bacon in them too  yum   However  this is not a place to go if you are looking for a small portion   Although it was good  I think of it as a once in a lifetime splurge that I never need to have again because it was sinfully delicious!  My husband had the biscuit thing  that was really good too ,positive,6523900
I was excited to see a street food cart (hut?) set up in North York while driving past a month ago  While the street food scene primarily been hot dogs around here  this cart has upped the game by offering some of Asias best snack food options  A permanent box set up at the corner of Yonge & Finch (just outside the Shoppers)  Kims A La Cart serves cheapie eats made perfect for the stumbling soju drinker  I was impressed with the selection of food  but I came for the fish cakes  Cute little waffles in the shape of fishies and stuffed with red bean paste  these are the perfect late night snack  Theyre about 6 long  and you can order them three in a bag  If youre craving salty or savoury  there are other options as well  including pork belly  kimchi pickles  dumplings  and more  Heres to hoping more street food options pop up in the city!Cash Only  obvs ,positive,2716943
Stumbled into this restaurant on our first night in Montreal out of the pouring rain   We were a party of 6 and we did not have a reservation   The restaurant was packed and we were not too hopeful that we would get in   However  the manager/host (super friendly guy) quickly ran off to see if he could setup a table for 6   We were pleasantly surprised that he could seat us   As one of the starters (on the house) he brought out some bruschetta that was very good   Tons of flavor and it did not disappoint   We knew if the starter was this great that the meal should hopefully be fabulous   For our main entrees the table chose the following: Veal Milanese Papperdelle (Ceaser to start  fantastic salad) Chicken Pesto Pasta Special Penne  Truffle/Sausage Chicken Special with sundried Tomatoes (and Italian Bean/Pasta Soup to start)They also had a great selection of wines   Overall we had a great time and the food  service and ambience was just perfect ,positive,4625669

OMG Im so excited this place is right below my new office!  Came here for the first time and cant wait to go back Its rare to find an Asian restaurant with good food  good service  AND good ambiance   Asian Fusion Cafe has all three!  Dont let the fusion steer you away!  The majority of the menu is authentic Cantonese/Szechuan/Taiwanese  with a small section of Chinese restaurant staples As a lonely Asian in the desert  Im always looking for food that reminds me of home  so of course I get the Taiwanese Beef Noodle soup even though its nearing 100 degrees outside   It was so good!!!!  The broth lacks some of the complexities of REALLY good noodle soup  but I get it  theyre trying to appeal to a crowd   You definitely cant get anything better in the valley   It tasted enough like Momma Chens cooking to keep me and my belly happy   Our waitress was also so nice and excited about the menu   She made some great recommendations that I cant wait to try next time I go!,positive,3976100
I went in to purchase pretipped extentions and it seemed that no one knew the price of them ! It started out at $50  $40  $35 then $55  As I waited for someone to confirm with a manager that was not at the salon and not answering their phone call that 3 people were trying to get ahold of  another 20 minutes  In the mean time I witnessed a lady that was upset due to how a special on the board read that wasnt clear and another lady walk out due to her stylist cancelling and no one calling to let the lady know  It seemed like no one had control of the front desk  I will deinitely NOT be going back to this salon as the hair extentions were way to expensive for what you got  Buying your hair on line is priced much better for the SAME hair ,negative,2807577
Went for a ride in Red Rock Canyon  then to Blue Diamond  and then I was famished  The guy at the bike shop in Blue Diamond recommended the burgers at this place  The waitress here said the buffalo burgers were the most popular  I think both said people come here specifically for the burgers  Good suggestions from both  The burger was good  if a little pricey at $12 99 (iirc ) Better than eating on the strip though  and you have little choice if youre on a bicycle around Red Rock Canyon  So no complaints  totally glad its there  Its a little tacky theme resorty  but a welcome dose of civilization in an area where it feels like its so far away!,positive,6217334
Went here for my birthday and had a great time  Our hostess was wonderful  precise  and informative about the food on the menu  I got crab cakes and the crab meat was succulent and filling  The brussell sprouts had bacon in them and very delicious  I would highly recommend this restaurant for birthdays  dinner  anniversary  or just a nice outing with friends  They also gave me a birthday card  a box or truffles  and a platter with fruit  truffles  and cake  I will be returning soon Flemings!!!!,positive,6233825

While in AZ for softball tourney the fam and I were craving Marios Peruvian (On Melrose in L A) decided to search for Peruvian food in the Tempe area and came across Inka fest  Glad we did  because the food was great we ordered the lomo saltado which was good and the jalella mixta which is a variety of fried seafood very good! Also enjoyed this awesome ice cream made of a fruit native to Peru  kind of a cantaloupe colored ice cream but was not overly sweet just sweet enough and nutty  It was Delish!! Very good experience staff was excellent!! Highly recommended!!,positive,6380904
Very disappointed  Maybe it was the fact that we didnt order pizza  but when your kids are disappointedthats not good  Portions are extremely small  Stick with the pizza because the kids meals are sized for four year olds  The kids ordered spaghetti and got less than a cup each  The waitress suggested we BUY another meal for them  The free scoop of gelato that came with the kids meal was smaller than the tablespoon they gave them to eat the dessert  My wife and friends ordered the pizza which was ok  I ordered a cup of soup and sandwich because Im a little tired of eating pizza every week  For nearly $4 I got a double shot of flavorless minestrone  The sandwich was good but not for the prices we paid  The new location is nice  But the ambiance didnt make up for the portions  the wait  or the lackluster waitING staff and service ,negative,5812913

This place is entirely disappointing  If they can ever understand the whole experience of eating at theirestablishment means quality service in addition to quality food  then they will be a lot more successful  The employees are clueless when it comes to courteous prompt service and could really care less to making a customer feel welcome  Absolute rudeness and managing a line  I guess it doesnt who is next in line but rather whoever they want to help next  Pathetic!!!,negative,5465060
I read the reviews on here and I have to say so far for me they are dead wrong!! My almost 2 year old was seen the same day when I called and said she was in pain   Within the same week they were able to get her into surgery and since then (its been almost 2 weeks) she has been out of pain and very happy!! Mother did crowns on her front 4 teeth and by far she looks so cute they did an amazing job!!! My other children had crowns done by another local childrens DDS and their teeth look like little chicklets!! I was so happy with their work I brought in my other 3 kids (all under the age of 8) they met with another dentist in this practice and I have to say she was just as awesome!!!!! My 8 year old was very very scared and they had tons of patients hes going back next week for a small filling! I wish I could give 10 stars!!!,positive,2534843

My moms 50th birthday was yesterday and I needed to send last minute flowers  I found Foothills Floral online and decided to call in my order  The gentleman on the phone with me was so nice and patient while I tried to figure out what I wanted my message to say  The bouquet I ordered was the florist special where they assemble it themselves and choose whatever flowers they like  Ordering flowers that I hadnt seen yet worried me but I trusted them and am happy I did  My mom called me later in the afternoon after receiving the flowers  raving about how good they look and it was beautiful  She also said the smell was so good and strong  it smelled like someone sprayed perfume (they didnt obviously) but they smelled that great!  Def using this company again instead of the commercial online flower sites Thanks for making my moms birthday extra special!,positive,3791263
I love the one in Tempe so I was hoping this would be as good  I was sadly disappointed  No one acknowledged me when I walked in and then waited 5 mins for someone to ask if I was read to order  Placed my order and waited another 5 mins or so  The lady gave it to me and promptly walked away to the back  My ice had almost no flavoring on it and the ice was chunky  They also never added the creme I paid for  Of course no one was in sight to fix this  Guess Ill stick with the Tempe one ,negative,2419160
I had heard about Papa Dels and was excited to try it after reading the reviews  I ordered a pepperoni  sausage and mushroom (my goto pizza)  The parking was difficult to find because its on the side of the building  Up the stairs is where you pay and when I got up there  the service was not very friendly  After paying and walking to my car  I noticed that the grease from the pizza was ooozing out of the box and dripped onto my jeans  I was fairly pissed about that  not only did it stain my jeans  but I knew I ordered a greasy pizza Deep dish pizza was pretty good  but there was soo much sauce and not enough cheese  I usually enjoy pizza  equally if not more on the second day of eating it  and this pizza was not very good on day two  Overall  Im not sure if I would go back  but Im glad that I tried it  I think there are better pizzas around town ,neutral,2135265
Okay I show up at the same time as a white fellow  Im in a raiders jersey fresh off work where Im a chef  Hes white in a blazer  I sit at the bar and she caters to him and shows me no respect  It takes her 15 minutes to take my drink order and then 30 minutes to take my food order  Mind you it is not busy and she disappeared for 10 or so minutes  I ask her for a recommendation for a drink and she recommends a long island ice tea  I felt discriminated against and Im not that type of person to throw the race card out like that ,negative,4020782

A nice location  with lots of space  Had heard about this chain from a friend  so decided to try it out  On my way by during work  so stopped in quickly for a fast lunch  A bit disorganized as I walked in and people were standing everywhere  No discernible line for ordering and staff having to deal with multiple things at the same time made things a bit confusing  I wasnt too hungry  so I got a Greek Salad  Quite a good salad  but the bread that everything comes with was awesome  Comes with a cool spicy sauce to dip  which pulls it all together  Will drop by again to get something with meat next time  when Im more hungry!,neutral,112589

I had to update my review of this dealership  After many horror stories about other dealerships  I continue to be amazed at the service I receive  Most places in Scottsdale  whether it be a restaurant or a car dealership give service that we can acceptable but I know when I go to Chapman for service on my VW I will get top notch service  I arrived and was greeted  told what needed to be done and was told how long it would take  I was updated on how the service was going and it was done when they said it would be done  Having help from my service advisor Pete  makes the process smooth and uncomplicated  Thanks to John Gerimano  the manager who is always helpful  This is why I will continue to buy my cars here ,positive,2168528

2nd time here   Erica the bar tender had a problem with us taking 30 seconds too long to decide what beer we wanted  After that she didnt ask us if we were ok or check to even see if we wanted another round  Then when we were closing out  she shorted us on our change and said it was tax included  Funny cause I didnt think there was a 20% tax on beer  Place was cool but service made it shit ,negative,42913

A couple of friends and I were looking around for a bowling shop for some shoes and balls and stumbled upon Haynes through a friend suggestion  Prices are fair with a decent variety of different shoes/balls/other bowling stuff  But the reason why it has now become our goto bowling shop here in Vegas is their great customer service  5 stars isnt enough to show our appreciation for them  Were all newish to the game  but the workers there (forgot the names of the two ) spent time thoroughly helping us out with what we were looking to buy and also gave us lots of insight and tips about foundation  form  etc  Well be back for sure!,positive,77840
Great selection of beer  wonderful people  and friendly service   Easily my favorite bar in Tempe   I have been by many times and they keep their beer selection changing and interesting   I have never been disappointed with the recommendation of the bartender ,positive,1565501

Again I would like to congratulate NVISION on their outstanding service   I am referring to the one located on Cheyenne    I had another eye exam today and the doctor recommended that I temporarily use strengthened eye glasses    I thought that would be expensive   Dr Parks male assistant suggested I talk with their optical center   I walked in and was greeted by two of the most fabulous women   Their names are Nina and Kathy   The most professional and most helpful ladies I have run across in my 3 years in Nevada   Not only did they save me hundreds of dollars from purchasing new glasses  they recommended readers which they had in stock  Their company and thoughtfulness was amazing   This facility as outdone itself in customer satisfaction    Thank you Nina and Kathy for you superb service ,positive,213831

I never thought Id be leaving a review for a podiatrist but my experience with Dr  Kayce was exceptional  Like others have said he walks in on time  greets you warmly  has an excellent bedside manner  and explains all of the treatment options including which one he most recommends  and is respectful of your choice  Also  he numbs you! Ive had a podiatrist operate on my foot without a block before because    Im not sure  he was a barbarian?! I went years thinking it was okay until I had a block done with Dr  Kayce and Ive been mad as hell at the other podiatrist ever since  I have been a nurse practitioner for two years and before that an RN for six  and I have never encountered this professionalism and competence and bedside manner trifecta in a physician before  Not even close  I will continue to see and recommend friends and family to Dr  Kayce ,positive,2492635
Dontez  the manager who now is getting his own store in south Scottsdale  is the absolute best!  Friendly and extremely attentive and not only to us   I watched him interact with various guests to his store as my family and I had lunch there recently   I remarked to him that he was an awesome employee and he told me it was his last day there and was getting a promotion to run his own store in south Scottsdale   WELL deserved if you ask me   Ive been in the customer service business for 30 years and hes one of the finest Ive seen   Id hire him in a split second!  Great job Dontez and keep up the good work!,positive,930562
I think the theme was lost on me the night I went b/c there was a band playing so it was hard to get the video game vibe   Sure there are weird drawings and videos everywhere  but the band was taking up most of my attention   And this may have attributed to the eclectic crowd that night   You wouldnt think some of these peeps where the video game playing sort     It wasnt really my scene but it was a cool little place   I cant really say there are better or worse places in the old Vegas strip b/c the whole area felt sorta shady ,neutral,2627269

Hey  $1 bowling after midnight from Sunday to Thursday  you cant beat it!

In todays competitive environment  it is a pleasure to work with such a service oriented company as ABC Glass   I have used them both professionally  when my business was broken into  and personally  for a new shower door   I found their prices to be competitive and their service to be top notch   They arrived as scheduled and completed both jobs with true professionalism   I would highly recommend ABC Glass and will be sure to use them again ,positive,3185343
Though it might take a while to be seated  this place is absolutely worth the wait!!! The dishes are original and gorgeous  the staff is very kind  extremely helpful and accommodating (food allergies here) and never snob   After eating at that kind of breakfast place  I really dont see why I would eat breakfast in a chain of restaurants  We had the scone with marmelade and lemon cream  the corn waffles with gravlax and finally the mish mash (scrambled eggs of the day)  The espresso and the spicy hot chocolate were really good  And also the little sample of their daily juice was a nice touch  Definitely a must when in Montreal!,positive,5662894
Everything was delicious and on point  Great prices  and quality of food  We ordered the peking duck (two courses)  beef and green onion pancakes  eggplant casserole  fried tofu cubes  green beans  and Xiao Long bao with crab meat  Servers also refilled our team and water constantly  Would recommend 100%!,positive,1018255
I called sun city and scheduled an inspection on my broken springs  Prompt apt and called me to tell me my service tech would arrive  Steve Alo arrived and completely explained what needed to be done  He completed the repair and adjusted my garage door as well  Professional service all around  would definitely recommend for your garage door repair needs ,positive,1917187
Christina is excellent! I dont ever want to go to anyone else for a haircut!! She listens attentively  gives suggestions  and its a plus that she can concentrate  on cutting while conversing with the guest  Ive had her before on nellis/charleston location and I really like how she cut my hair  But when I came back one day  she wasnt there anymore and that time I couldnt remember her name so nobody could tell where she was at  Luckily after 2 years     I went to CVS on vegas valley/nellis  I saw a supercuts in the same shopping center and decided to get a haircut! To my big surprise  I saw Christina  Although idr her name  I know her by face! And Im so glad I walked in!!! I knew I was gonna get a good cut when I saw her  which I did!!! Wow! It has been a while since I felt such satisfaction with my hair  Thanks Christina!!! See you next time!!,positive,737577
This was my first experience hiring movers and it was fantastic!!  The team of 4 (Ray  Art  James  & Jose) did a wonderful job   They gave me a courtesy call when they were 10 minutes away   They showed up timely ( a little early even)   They were hardworking  efficient  and very careful with everything   I am very impressed with their work and I thought the cost was very reasonable   I would definitely hire them again!,positive,5627859
This was our first trip to the ranch house and we live a mile from it If you are looking for a fancy dressed up dinner spot  this is not it  What it is though is comfortable  a down home feeling of being at your grandparents for Sunday dinner by the big fire place  Even though it was very full of people you could still have a normal voice conversation  The food is amazing  not over bearing in size  I had a 16 ounce filet that was perfectly cooked  cut with a fork tender  The twice baked potatoes were silky smooth They serve steak and sea food  My wife had lobster and said it was amazing  If you need to ask about prices for superb food and service  dont bother  Four of us with salads  appetizers and entrees with no alcohol was $205 not including tip  Bob Taylors Ranch House is amazing  worth your time to get to it  though in a residential area  and worth every penny ,positive,5646234
My water heater went out when I was flat broke  Had just bought a car the month before  So with the down payment plus registration i was financially tapped out  I dont have great credit so going to home depot  lowes  or rc willey was not option  So precision plumbing allowed me to make installments on the new water heater  Technician came out on time and installation took less than 2 hours  Great job precision plumbing ,positive,3820955
We are out of towers in Charlotte for a wedding and came to Viva Chicken to try out some of their staples  the quinoa stuffed avocado and the great sandwich  We also ordered the taco bowl at the suggestion of the worker who took our order  We found seating outside which was quaint and beautiful with lots of plants and flowers  We had been traveling that morning and ate breakfast so we werent incredibly hungry  But the food gave us appetite for more! The taco bowl surprised me the most  the soft rice topped with red onions  chicken  pinto beans and the side sauce for a little kick  The avocado was very filling though we got it as an appetizer  it could probably be a meal for one  Everything was delicious  customer service was great  Five stars in our book! :),positive,5947780
Have not been in a long time  BF is in LOVE w/Jersey Mikes  he recently ate there and SWORE it was better than every   same ole Jersey Mikes    the staff was really nice/helpful  just not a big fan  Either you love JMs or you dont  I am on the fence ,neutral,1706453
We had come here a couple of years ago for just drinks  Wanted to grab a bite before the Beatles love show and decided to come back here We ordered am appetizer (so mad I forgot what it was  but it was tasty)  a strip steak and the au gratin potatoes  Steak was delicious  the potatoes were just Ok    the menu description sounded better than they tasted  The drinks were not good  Too sweet  We really didnt even finish them  The service was excellent and the prices were good Id come back again  as Ive enjoyed it both times!,positive,6019226

Everything was OK here  not great  but OK    I ordered the Dirty South for a cocktail which is made with their house infused blueberry bourbon   It was pretty good  but ended up coming out with my meal  so I didnt really get to enjoy it   Plus it was pretty expensive  even for Scottsdale ($14)   We ordered the deviled eggs for an appetizer   Again OK  just nothing exceptional   For dinner  we had the pulled pork sandwhich and ribs    Both were just OK   The ribs had good flavor  but were a bit dry   I might come back for drinks  but probably not for food ,neutral,1017750
Your typical McDonalds  When we pulled up to the drive thru at around 1am  only one car ahead of us as the window  They moved ahead quickly but we didnt get our food for another 45  Maybe it was because of the time of day  I like that they are 24hr drive thru ,neutral,6536453
This place is definitely the place to go for a bowl of delicious noodles  From its taste to its texture the noodle is flawless  What I didnt like about the bowl was the meet inside; I remember getting their house special  and the pork chop inside is very salty and tasted like old meat    I thought it was a very bad combination with the noodles ,positive,5462872

My first Cirque du Soleil show and well worth it  Save money by researching show tickets and take a gamble and sit in category 3  The theater has a fantastic layout and intimate enough so sitting on the sides will give you a great view  Avoid the lower sections near the stage as you will end up with a kink in your neck as many acrobatic performances are up high  Looking forward in seeing O and KA next!,positive,3717004

Ordered a chicken Grilled Chicken Caesar Wrap and received this  I sure as heck would not spend $14 on a salad  Then the chicken was over cooked and dry  Be careful when ordering delivery  They obviously dont pay attention to what you order or the quality of food theyre preparing   even with the simplest dish ,negative,4103988

This is a very nice little neighborhood Mexican restaurant  The neighborhood itself is a little sketchy  but the inside of this place has a welcoming atmosphere with some beautiful colorful decor  Rosas has been serving Mesa residents Baja Style Mexican food for over 20 years  I love chips and salsa and they gave us a couple salsa choices  The green salsa had a very flavorful sweet taste to it  My buddies got tamales and really enjoyed them  I went for the cheese enchilada and chile relleno combo plate  I love how Mexican dishes all blend together and this plate was no different  My enchilada just oozed with cheese (and served Christmas style  both red and green sauce) and the asado poblano chile was nicely battered and cooked  This place was an awesome unexpected find for us and the customer service was great too! I never take for granted the great Mexican food we have here in AZ ,positive,5243420
I had no idea what to expect but went for Yelp Kicks Butt (50% off) and had a great time!  The space is huge and didnt have to wait for any walls or training  etc  The staff is REALLY helpful and know what they are doing    I went with my girlfriend and we were nervous about being responsible for each other as neither of us had done anything like this but we trusted the process and everything was fine Its a one time fee for a day pass and you can stay as long as you want  Absolutely no pressure to leave or anything but its very exhausting   After 2 hours  our bodies were already sore  Not something we would do every weekend but would recommend this as a fun activity and something out of the ordinary!,positive,2146047
If ordered between 121pm the delivery person will apologize for not being freakin fast and say they dont have very many drivers  Any other part of the day and these guys delivery the subs as fast as it would take for me to get to their store  They are freaky fast  Food is always correct ,positive,3111384
Pretty great little spot tucked away on American pacific  When I moved last year to a new area of Hendo  I hoped on yelparoo to see what the local grub situation spot and behold this peaked my interest  I almost didnt venture here due to the fact that there is smoking inside  I have asthma so once the smoke level reaches a certain point i just cant do it  I was pleasantly surprised when I visited the smoke was not an issue  My waitress was really kind  I opted for a sandwich and some fries  The sandwich was pretty good and the fries were really good  The spot is great due to its ridiculous closeness to me and happy hour specials ,positive,4242632
4 stars only for the Happy hour experience  Awesome service from the front door to the bar   yay!  Generous happy hour food menu and yummers on the Cocktail specials   Watch ANY game you can imagine on all the Tvs  Plus it is kind of a sausage fest for us women   just saying :),positive,55133
Well  after a long day of trying to figure out what to do in the Cleveland area  during a flood watch; we decided that a different point of interest would give us some relief  Thunderstorms started at Erie Beach and followed us to Crocker Park Chocolate never disappoints us  which we havent had in a long time  especially chocolate ice creamRocky Mountain Chocolate Ice Cream in a waffle cone hit the spot plus the chocolate Almond Bear Im devouring now as I write this review ,positive,5917

I can not say enough great things about this place  My husband and I are in town for two days from Los angeles  We had a car issue and a good friend recommended Brake Masters  We took our car in this morning  What I like is that they are honest people  Their prices are listed  They dont take advantage of people  There were several people who were ahead of us and i was amazed at how inexpensive their services were  Mainly  this place doesnt try to sell you stuff you dont need  They dont make commission  so their goal is to get you in  fix you up and get you out  I would trust taking my car here again if we were in the area again  5 stars for good customer service and honesty  which are two hard things to find these days,positive,1955330
Great place   excellent rolls  friendly polite service  fair prices I work down the road  we go there all the time  everyone I know loves it   Ive had pretty much everything on the menu  hot and cold  except maybe the wraps  I liked everything  My favorite is probably the teenager roll     its like a flash fried roll    and a nice contrast to  conventional rolls if you want something a little different ,positive,1556083
Slowest service  rudest people  worst food  I love bojangles  but this one is a joke  Sat in the drive through for 45 minutes  all for a terrible meal  Biscuit was flatter than a pancake and the chicken was super dry  I wouldnt recommended this place to a damn dog ,negative,4463467
A great pub! The people make it feel like a second home  Ive never been to a bar where the people are so friendly  After going there once or twice they remembered my name and having drinks with us  Theyre a pretty awesomely outgoing staff  For food  try the spicy chicken burger  one of the best things Ive had in a long time  And their mac & cheese is amazing on a cold day  And they have some of the best fries Ive had in montreal  they come with this amazing spicy mayo  Monday night is 5$ mojito night  and Quentin makes a great mojito!,positive,98034
Stayed for 3 days two nights here at Ellis Island  Within the first two hours of being here my husband hit a rather big amount of money on one of our favorite missions that I won on last time we visited  The hotel host came over and offered him a free shirt along with offering us a room upgrade  We were then appreciative  The staff took care of all of our requests and needs with professionalism  On top of everything else  they even charged us less than our original room cost and for that we will definitely be rerurning again  We love the food  the play and the people here so we definitely recommend doing all three for anyone who comes to Vegas ,positive,4582893
It is well worth the time and money to bring your little ones here for a day of fun   I brought my nieces and nephews to OSC on 2 occasions   They killed 2 to 3 hours on the interactive educational games both times   They never got tired of the educational games on the 6th floor   The games cover physics (air  temperature  sound  movement  mass  electricity  etc)  biology (human and insects)  and a bit of chemistry (paper making)   OSC has added a section of interactive fun on the 5th floor   I think this section is more suitable for young adults and older instead of children   From the ground to the 4th floor  OSC is filled with displays of scientific knowledge   I love to scroll and read them   One day is not enough If you have young children to bring along  you can join their annual memberships   For $130 (2016 price)  the membership covers unlimited regular admission for 2 adults and 4 children   It also cover reciprocal admission to a list of international science centres ,positive,3213523
Overrated Filipino restaurant!! I would rather go eat at Goldilocks!! Mainly came here for their pork belly  which tasted ok  nothing mouthwatering  Tasted just like the other lechons at turoturo Filipino restaurants  We also had the bagoong rice  The rice was hard and only a small scoop of mango was included in it  The bulalo soup was ok tasting  The crispy spinach appetizer was extremely salty!!,negative,4165396
I cant say enough great things about Slavko and Vesnas business   The shelves are crammed with so many rare  amazing Balkan spices  canned/jarred foods  and treats that my eyes popped out of my head   The deli counter serves up burek and gibanica that tasted like it was straight out of a Belgrade cafe   The proprietors were quirky and completely charming and a joy to talk to   Now to talk them into opening up a location in Colorado    ,positive,1967853

Ive been here a couple of times now and the pizza is perfectly fine  but nothing special in my opinion   If you like thick crust pizza  this is not the place for you  everything here is thin and crispy  which happens to be how I like it   The toppings are fresh and flavorful  but sometimes I wish they would use more of them on the pizza   The service here has been fine and helpful  and parking is easy as its a private lot ,neutral,2994198
After shredding downtown with the little lady we decided to check out this quaint little restaurant  First  their is a lot of outside seating  The ambiance outside is very nice as well  The inside is smaller but nicely decorated  This is a great place for dates or romantic oneonones  Our meals were great  We had the calamari  a pizza  and a wood fired sandwich  Pros great ambiance good food decent pricesCons  limited inside seating just okay service parked in the back  Trash bin was overflowing and smell turned us off ,positive,206811
This is the original location  There is now an additional location in Goodyear  This one does have a home feel and the building has a lot of character  but the other location is more like a regular restaurant  which you might prefer it if you are claustrophobic or dont like being in tight quarters with strangers The food is always fantastic  The enchilada sauce is the best I have ever had  I could drink it!! Food is consistent between locations and visits  Portions are generous  Prices between $7 and $13  One of my favorite places ,positive,5348772

I hate to give it 1 star but the food tasted like it was microwaved  We order nachos and cheese  When we got the nachos the cheese looked solid kinda like chedar cheese  Also the mix drink tasted more like water hahaNow the bowling lanes needs a big makeover  The owner hopefully knows this  If one person needs the side skis rails then everyone uses the rails  Theyres no automation on this bowling alley Also it was expensive  We could of gone to main event and it would of been 20 bucks cheaper ,negative,2175465
I have been a fan of the Evil Dead movies and loved this show The Emcee was funny  talented  and yes  vulgar  What else would you expect? This was just the start of the fun The cast was incredible and campy  The music had me humming along  I have seen this show  in NYC  when it first opened and I believe this cast much better  than that first show I would highly recommend the splatter zone  You will get wet and dirty  but it is great fun  Dont dress to the nines If you could see one show in Vegas  make it this one  Forget the hater comments  they were most likely expecting Shakespeare or a Cirque Show ,positive,2187711
Came here all way from Canada and brought some relatives with me  It said online they close at 11 and when we arrived 3 minutes before close because we didnt know it closed at 9:30 we were rudely told repeatedly by 3 employees they were closing  Then a employee pushed a clothing rack by me and hit my ankle  It was wild and I didnt appreciate it  Good luck ,negative,642067
Dr  Ray has been great  He has seen my family of six for the last six years  He is great with the kids and I always feel like Im getting the truth from him  My biggest complaint with the dentists I saw before was they were very pushy about doing work  The last dentist or her assistant at least almost seemed angry when I said I wanted to wait  I visited doctor Ray for a second opinion once and he said the same item could wait and the price he gave me was about half as much when I was ready to do the work  I would highly recommend Ray Family Dental ,positive,947455
The Crepe Club is absolutely beautiful and I love the concept; we need more creperies in Arizona  However  I hate to say it   I have some complaints  The first sales clerk was not knowledgeable at all about the menu  They didnt have the giant fresh macaroons that are shown all over their Yelp pictures  In fact  the second sales person I spoke with told me they hadnt had fresh macaroons in a week! No thanks  After I sat down  both the employees disappeared in the back for the whole time I ate  missing a potential sale when another woman walked in and saw no one  The crepe was good  but not the best Ive ever had  I got the creme de lemon and it was a little overwhelming with the amount of lemon juice  None the less  it was still enjoyed  Their prices are steep  the service is poor  and Im off to try a different breakfast spot ,negative,4733162
Seems weird how the last two times Ive been here Ive valet my car and when I got my car back I was missing items out of my center counsel  Are you guys seriously stupid?

This is the worst place to go if its your birthday and you need to make a slight menu alteration! Such horrible experience when we simply asked to hold the bacon  Not sure why the manager and owner was adamant about no substitutions but we got up and left immediately! Turned a birthday celebration into massive disappointment  Absolutely inexcusable  Its not like this kitchen is a Michelin Restaurant   I would advise anyone contemplating visiting this establishment to go elsewhere  The owner has a misguided sense of entitlement    ,negative,5358296
I thought this place was pretty good and the service was good too  They dont use MSG which is important to me  The server was fast and gave us a good explanation of the food  Ive been here twice and I will go back again  I have had the Moo Goo Gai Pan which I liked a lot  The veggies were fresh and it was cooked well  I tried the Walnut Shrimp (my daughters) which was also very good  I had the Monglian Beef the second time I went  which wasnt very spicy but had good flavor  overall  And we really love the Pot Stickers! We also got something for desert but I cant remember the name of it  It was like a small pie with egg glaze on top  It tasted like a cookie and I enjoyed that as well ,positive,2635351
Was at this Walmart tonight & witnessed the most awful thing   It wasnt busy & I got in line behind a lady that maybe had 10 items in her cart  the cashier came out from behind the register & said to me you may want to go to a new check out line bc this lady ahead of you is paying with WIC and WIC customers take forever! I couldnt believe what I just heard   I was so shocked I didnt even know how to react   Then he says I normally wouldnt tell you to go to another line but WIC takes forever!!! I was completely floored & didnt even know how to react to what I just heard   I was just stopping into this store while we were on vacation & this took me so off guard I didnt even know how to react   I called the night mgr after I got to the hotel  when i realized the embarrassment this poor lady must have felt but of this insensitive cashier   I hope the mgr had a meeting with this employee ,negative,5912200
I had water damage from a pipe that bursted in my place  It was a huge mess  and we didnt know what to do  We called Copper State Home Builders  and they came right away to look at the issue  They gave us an estimate  and explained their whole process of fixing it  We agreed to their terms  and the issue was worked on right away  The process was real easy  their workers were professional  and the job was done in a week  I recently got a followed up call by one of their workers about my experience with Copper State Home Builders  and told them it was excellent ,positive,2170092
Monster is our favorite  actually  our only  art and framing store for more than 10 years  Whether my company needs art for its walls  for a charity event or for live presentations  Paul and the team at Monster Framing not only achieve everything we desire  but the finished product is always applauded by others  From the massive Matrix posters framed for Tony at Zappos and the teachers at West Academy  to the hundreds of 11x16 posters for live presentations  to the irreplaceable signed pieces we may never part with  Monster is the one and only art and framing partner for HeroSchool us,positive,3628211
This place has great food but if you have kids stay away   I had my 9 month old with me and had to hold him on my lap while sitting on a backless chair because they did not have high chairs   I know hipster places like these do these kinds of things to passively NOT encourage families to come and cramp their cool style but I would have just preferred  an honest answer from them when I called ahead of time to see if the place was kid friendly and they told me yes   Other then that the Mac and cheese was bomb dignity,neutral,5407842

I went to Loving Huts grand opening on Sunday the 19th   They prepared a variety of food for us to sample  and it was delicious   I especially liked the chow mien and the fried shrimp   The Pink Lady was also good   I think it is a mixture of cranberry juice and soy milk with crushed ice  very refreshing!I have been waiting for more veg options on the west side  and I will definitely be going back!,positive,2821122
Im not a coffee drinker but Ill have the occasional tea latte so I stopped here for one  Its busy  but the barrista was quick so I didnt have to wait long  They use ethically traded and locally roasted beans for their coffee too  My tea was made with hand bagged loose leaf tea and served with a funky hand knit cover to keep my hands safe  How thoughtful  I sat for and hour and saw that the staff were friendly to everyone and seemed happy to be there ,positive,2930722

I had ordered business cards  was quoted a price and after giving my credit card which was charged for art and then told we no longer work with this press was charged an amount higher than the original quote  When I inquired why at least the art charge was higher than originally quoted I never received any response  I was quoted almost triple $378 53 for 2000 cards at 14pt  weight than what I was able to get with another printer $118 85 for 2500 cards at 16 pt  weight  Things have a funny way of working out for the best sometimes and this was definitely one of them as I found a much better and less expensive alternative  Do your homework before ordering from this company you might just save yourself some time  aggravation  and money ,negative,2147348

I purchased 10 hours of incar driving lessons and told them I was in a hurry to complete them before school started  They told me I would start the next day and get a call from the driver  Every day after that I would not get a call  Id call them at the end of the day and they assured me I would get a call the next day  This went on for 3 days until I got a call  The driver said I had to wait another 2 days before we could start  After two days  he cancelled 30 mins before the lesson and asked to reschedule to later in the day  Fine  When it came time for that lesson  he was late and when I called to see where he was  he said his car was broken down and I needed to wait until maybe tomorrow  I called the school and got my refund after that ,negative,2525872
This is my boyfriend and my new favorite restaurant   We had a few cocktails  a little antipasti  the ribs and the butternut squash ravioli   Everything was just great   I had a whiskey cocktail  of which they have about 4 on the menu  and really enjoyed it   As a whiskey lover who is not yet badass enough to drink it straight  it was wonderful to see actual house cocktails with whiskey that were nuanced and mild  and still let you taste the liquor  Both of our dishes were perfect and came in adequate servings and at the end of the night the bill was more than reasonable for the type and amount of food we enjoyed   I honestly would have paid a lot more for it    We went on a Saturday night and waited just long enough to have a cocktail at the bar first   Our server was nice and although he only came by once  we had everything we needed and no complaints ,positive,5272468

Never again  On my first trip to the store  i found the fish i was looking for  I left a deposit with owner Donna and told her i would be back first thing in the morning  I was there but she sold my fish  Its not a common fish  Who does this?

Sonic is always something exciting for me whenever traveling because it is like that rare  endangered species of bird that you do not see in your own homeland  You have found its feather before  but you cannot recall the last time you actually saw one Well this time  we were DETERMINED to track this rare beast down     and track we did! Once we caught it  the result was mixed to say the least  It was good!     just not great But that didnt matter  It was the allure of finding this gem of a lunch stop with its beautful plumes of cherry limeades  ocean water and chicago dogs that did matter  It was the excitement of ordering through a little intercom then  voila!  food appears! It was that  that made this experience worth having ,neutral,4553694
This trip was awesome! We went yesterday (day before 4th of July) it wasnt crowded at all  We got there around 12  There was no trash in the river  all the people were nice and respectful and beautiful scenery  Heres why Im knocking 1 star: I WISH SOMEONE WOULDVE EXPLAINED THAT YOU DONT HAVE TO PAY A SINGLE DOLLAR TO FLOAT THE RIVER!! After spending 100 on tubes and bus passes  I realized they have parking lots at every stop  I thought  hmm??? Thats weird? Then I realized after talking to a few people  you can drive 2 cars  Park one at the top of the river  one at the bottom  bring your own tubes  and youll save $17 a person  We couldve spent all the money we used on a big beautiful raft  and we couldve actually saved a ton of money  I was well prepared for this trip and I read tons of reviews and tips  So if I could give you any advice  I would suggest buying a raft for all your people  and driving yourself  Other then that  it was an AWESOME trip ,positive,5608736

Desperately looking for a service repair center for my lawn mower I looked on yelp and found Sohars  When I dropped off my machine I was impressed with the show room floor and the receptionist as I walked in  The staff was very knowledgable and kind  I was told upfront the service dept was behind 2wks and they were exactly to the day  My machine needed parts and I was told it would be the following week before it was ready  and again at their word it was ready to go  It was a very good experience and WORTH the long wait! Price was a flat fee of $75per hr and with the added cost of the parts my total came to $108 00  Fair price for the quality of service and a professional experience  Thank you!,positive,873422

Really loved this place! Its basically a night club and sushi restaurant in one  We came here for a birthday party 18 people  And the service was great  No delays and no lag  Didnt mess up our orders or checks  The sushi was great  Huge (overwhelming) menu with a large variety of food for everyone even the nonsushi lovers  Although the sushi was great and good quality  the sizes of the rolls were small and expensive  Wouldnt giving this place a try again some other time ,positive,4314832

I ordered one of their Gourmet chili cheese dogs since it was my first time here   While I waited for them to expertly prepare my dog  I read all over the walls about their acclaimed and innovative dogs   This caused my expectations to rise   I took it to go and ate it in my Tahoe and at first bite noticed the chili was ice cold and the dog only slightly warmed   It was so cold that the cheese didnt even melt!   To make things worse  the bun was so inadequate it came apart in my hands as I attempted to eat it   They had to know the chili was in the chiller so why not even put it under the salamander to warm the whole thing up?  Or how about warming the chili in the micro before service?  I did not take it back I just tossed it and will not return   No wonder that there was no one else in this place??,negative,2509997
I am I town on business and was taken there for a business dinner  As someone who enjoys a steak house I found that Red did not disappoint  Our server Scott was new and did a fantastic job taking care of our needs From appetizers to the amazing and perfectly cooked steaks to tempting desserts everything was fantastic  The location was great and my only complaint is they dont have one in Philadelphia so that I may eat there more often ,positive,1840171

Do yourself a favor and stay elsewhere  As other reviewers noted  this hotel is damp and mildewy  I feel its unsafe as it has to be full of mold because the rooms smell awful  Everything   sheets  towels  my clothes   felt wet  The area is rundown and this hotel is no exception  The staff was not helpful  They liked talking to each other but not to guests  The valet service was a cluster  Things in the room (alarm clock and tv remote) were broken  The room service food was terrible  It is the worst hotel experience Ive ever had and I travel a lot  Id give it zero stars if I could  The whole hotel needs to be gutted and rebuilt and the entire staff needs to be trained ,negative,908525

Stayed at the hotel for a couple of days for some work training  The hotel was clean  The rooms were comfortable and the breakfast was great  I would definitely stay at this hotel again if I was going to Cleveland but unfortunately I do not get the chance to go to Cleveland that often  It is also a nice feature that every room is a suite with a separate bedroom and sitting room  I should also say that Internet is free if you are an AT&T customer ,neutral,4582560

I had forgotten that strip malls like this still exist   Its like jumping into a time machine and seeing the past up close again Its worth taking a walk around just to remember what malls used to be like   But if youre looking to do some shopping there are probably other places just near by that offer you a better experience ,negative,2134109
What a awesome tiki bar  this place is a slamdunk  6 of us were in Vegas for vacation from Boston and stopped by for happy hour  The staff was great  we were greeted at the door and bar by a couple friendly pinup themed dames  And Captain Joey Guns the manager stopped by to chat  come to find out he was from BTown  Of course the Mai Tais are a must and the cocktail menu has plenty of other tasty Polynesian drinks sure to satisfy  The decor is a collection of things that follows the legend of William Tobias Faulkner (WTF)    nuf said  When your in town  be sure to have the Golden Tiki on your short list  you wont be disappointed ,positive,6295815
Im torn about Tiburon  On the one hand  to eat in front of one of AZs largest aquariums is awesome  especially for reef tank nerds like me and my husband  Its just too bad that the restaurant itself isnt better  The menu only has one vegetarian main entree on it  so thats what my husband had to get  It was supposed to be grilled veggies with a portobello centerpiece  What came were some (as in not many for $16) limp veggies with maybe 1/3 of a portobello  When my husband pointed this out to the waitress  she spoke to the chef who said that he had run out of mushrooms  They comped us a dessert to make up for it  The creme brulee was fine about like most served in chain restaurants  My steak was pretty good  but was served with a few giant acrid onion rings and lukewarm mashed potatoes  I realize that we are paying in part for the atmosphere  but its really hard to justify when the food is so subpar and the restaurant is obviously poorly run ,negative,2958382

I really like this location  Its clean and organized  The layout is good as well  Its larger then the majority of locations  That means more pumps and more concessions available inside  The polar pops are very popular  You cant beat their price for the value  They have a lot of hot items as well  They have been doing deals with different combinations of drinks and snacks that are pretty good  Its nice to save a bit if you are going to buy them anyway The employees that I have interacted with have been welcoming  I used to come here every day for awhile and they knew me by name  Had to get my morning coffee!This area has been really developing  There is a good amount of parking if you just wanted to get something front inside and your not getting gas ,positive,2549952

Bar Marco had delicious food  The burger and pork dishes were the top picks at our table  I had the pasta bacon  and Apple dish and felt it was over salted  However  the service here makes it not worth the visit  We had reservations for 11:30 and we didnt get seated till 45 min after this  The drinks made the wait bearable but the mixed drinks were over priced and coffees were not refilled with out chasing down a waiter  Once we were sat we never we asked if we wanted new drinks  A quick brunch with friends ended up being 3 hrs  In summary  awesome food but terrible service ,neutral,442563
Yay! IHOP!There isnt anything too exciting to say   I normally order take out from here   I am not a morning person  or a breakfast person really   But sometimes I really want steak and eggs  but not to deal with a restaurant   When I call in my order  they are always really helpful   As is the hostess/cashier when I pick up my order I have also dined in the restaurant   If you actually go for breakfast  it can get REALLY crowded   If it is a weekend  be prepared to wait   I love that their chocolate milk is actually milk and chocolate syrup instead of premixed crap   I am pretty easy to please   I dont think Ive ever had a bad meal from this IHOP  so its hard to find any complaints   They get 3 stars because  well  its IHOP Just your typical  chain breakfast joint (although they obviously serve much more than breakfast) ,neutral,6497745

Wasnt so impressed with this place    I came with my 6yr old  who loves cheese pizza  nothing else on it  which is not too unusual for the kindergarten crowd     The 10 pizza for a cheese only seemed a bit small  even for him   So  I got the 14  which was $16   This is really expensive in my opinion for a 14 pizza  that was OK tasting   I thought the crust was a bit too thick and not flavorful    That said  a good variety of ingredients added may make it a lot better    Just saying if youre going to get a cheese pizza for the kiddos  you could do better elsewhere  I got one of the chicken salads  not bad and a good deal since you can add the pizza ingredients like a salad bar    The quality of the chicken was not good though   This is precooked/cut/cold/flavorless protein    Again  probably better mixed into a hot pizza    The staff was super friendly  so that is a plus Overall  with so many options for pizza and salad in the area    ,neutral,5933143
I recommend this place  Mike and Alan are great to do business with  The prices here are very comparable to anything online  Why not support this great local business! The staff immediately asked if we needed help within a minute of arrival and they are very knowledgeable and helpful We had a great experience here  My dad got an RC boat  Alan even customized a battery for my dad on the spot so the battery connector would work with the Deans configuration on his RC boat  We came back a second time for extra parts  Thanks Mike!We would go back to Superstition Hobby!They primarily sell RC equipment  drones  planes  helicopters  RC cars  and some FPV equipment  They also sell RC batteries  parts  and can order parts for you ,positive,2579102
Wow! Everything here is excellent  I came with my family and we all got something different  There were tostadas  quesadillas and tacos on the table and every single one of our meals was delicious The flavor was great on my pastor quesadilla  It wasnt fatty and greasy like many quesadillas Ive had  Instead it was subtle and sweet and citrusy  I often grow bored of quesadillas after a few bites  but this one made me wish I had ordered two  The pickled vegetables and salsa that come with the meal are a perfect compliment to the delicious plates  Tip  Bathrooms have no AC,positive,6466436
Again   Same kind of response from the staff   Careless and they even used bad words when myself and my cousin asked about quality of the food   Worst restaurant   Worst management,negative,214634
Suzie always does a great job   Quality work that lasts!!  The whole shop is helpful and seems to constantly have repeat customers   When you come expect great work and a fun atmosphere  Theyre honest and only do what you want or need done!,positive,4664426
Well today we went to bean for my birthday with my family  Only two items on the kids menu  Both items aredeep  fried or pan fried   Wanted to see if we can have the same veggies black beans  veggies etc in just a burrito or taco fashion to make it more healthy  The server said let me see what I can do  I went to the washroom and over heard the manger tell our server absolutely NO  Wow  after that we just left  and never to return  Went to Furn  which was great with lots of items for kids that not deep fried ,negative,6202368
Great company to deal with from the fist phone call to the final handshake of completion   Crew that moved my wife and I were friendly and worked their butts off All of our furniture was handled with care and arrived at our new house without any problems ,positive,1444521
My friends and I thoroughly enjoyed our visit  The moment we walked in we had a sense of being on vacation with Caribbean music softly playing in the background and the delightful pastel colors adding to the relaxed atmosphere  We were greeted warmly and had everything explained in detail  I was also impressed with the patience shown as we tried to decide how to best take advantage of so many options   We shared banana split rolled ice cream and chose strawberries and chocolate syrup to go in it  The ingredients are excellent quality and the taste was absolutely delicious! I had read about Xcites Sweet Connections in the Gaston Gazette and I am so glad they did the article  This is a fabulous business and I plan to return often and try more rolled ice cream and the gelato  Going to Xcites Sweet Connections certainly brightened our day!,positive,3739432
I came here based on reviews and my wife and I were not disappointed   The food was better than the well known national Italian chain and the prices were less  you cant beat that   The lasagna was to die for  best I have had out ,positive,1924758
La Unica has excellent food and options for all diets  It is very authentic  extremely fast and super affordable  They have dollar tacos every Tuesday which are Delicious and always keep the chips and salsa flowing free of charge  On top of all that the wait staff is kind and courteous  especially Evangeline and Ellie  La Unica is the best! I highly recommend!,positive,3388893
Love this place everyone there is so nice ! The food taste great ! Amanda Eric and Chris were very helpful with my order  I would definitely recommend this place to anyone!,positive,3510895
I sent this in to the online feedback site and the owner of the store called me   He was so apologetic   Joe is really nice and I hope this customers are reading this   He embodies a hard worker   He was honest and direct   Unfortunately  for him his workers leave him unable to compete with bigger stores   So for Joe  give the store a try ,neutral,2591350
Very nice and elegant hotel  Being raised in Vegas most of my life I saw how Vegas expanded and with that the Cosmo was built  Ive been here many times for Marquee Night Club and their restaurants  Its very modern and everything is easy to find inside  We stayed here for a staycation on January 2nd and it wasnt as busy as we thought it would be  The hotel is very spacious  We were able to get a Bellagio view with a balcony  There is a bathtub with a window so you are able to relax with a nice view of the strip  Youre even able to watch the Bellagio water show  Very romantic  It has a large living room  microwave  mini fridge  and 2 sinks in the bathroom  The shower is pretty cool which is connected to the bathtub area  Overall  It was very nice room ,positive,5842842
We love new places to dine & drink in our neighborhood  This place is a quaint cool spot anytime of the day  The service  on the other hand is horrible   During my visit  there was a dark hair female bartender who did not acknowledge Bar guest  It is always standard to say hello & if you are busy  a quick  I will be with you shortly  We got CRICKETS and the owner was sitting there the entire  Its a tiny bar so your customer are up close and personal   The bartender was slow  looked miserable and very unhappy   She pulls down the entire establishment   Good luck with her  We left and will never go back & we tell friends    you only get 1 first impression Sincerely Crickets,negative,6068044
ya know  the kids working here are ALWAYS nice  you can tell they are hurrying  They are polite to everyone  The pizza is hot BUT i wish they would put some more muscle into cutting it  I dont think we have ever received a pizza that completely cut through  I would also like to suggest that on busy nights like Friday and Saturday when the line is literally out the door  how about stuffing the oven with pizzas instead of the person 5 ahead in line orders 2  so they put 2 in  the next person orders 3 so they call for 3 to put in    They arent hot and ready if you arent filling the order til it comes in    If youre packed  just keep sticking them in  CLEARLY youre going to sell them  ;),positive,6664832
The chowder fries were the best fries Ive ever had  But the priced where way to high for my budget  I payed 25 00 for a lobster roll  chowder fries and a drink ,neutral,4807446
Cant say enough good things about this place and every person I dealt with   Went shopping on a Saturday morning of Memorial Weekend   Jennifer was extremely helpful and knew that Because I had already waited a month for furniture I ended up cancelling due to horrible customer service  I needed it as soon as possible   She asked me when I wanted it delivered and said they could do it on Monday  Memorial Day (2 days later) so I wouldnt have to take off time for work   They said they would deliver it between 911  they called when they were 10 mins out  were here by 9:15 and were done by 9:45   The guys that delivered / assembled  Mike  was extremely professional and were very careful not to bump walls  etc   Go here first  the prices and selection are amazing!,positive,704497
Always loved the burgers but last burger I ordered from there was terrible   I ordered it medium and it was so rare the blood was squeezing out of it  I took it to go and didnt want to bring it back  I should have complained I even took a picture of it but I just pulled the meat out of the bun a nuked it  Very disappointed ,negative,257831
Im not a Krispie Kreme fan  So when my sister asked if I wanted to try this cute little donut place I was skeptical  The two guys working greeted us as soon as we walked in  They were helpful and kind in explaining how the ordering process works  I ordered the dulce de leche donut and it was the best donut Ive ever had!! Sooooo delicious! There were eleven of us and we each loved our donuts  The Fractured Prune is definitely worth a try  Ill be returning again soon ,positive,2929725
really enjoyed this place  got the carne asada bombero burrito and wow  the chipotle sauce was bomb com  beans and rice were on point  only problem i had was how much tortilla there was compared to inside ingredients  tip: fill up on insides to bulk up burrito,positive,6624970
Ate at Rail after finding out that one of our diners had a seafood allergy  and we couldnt eat at Wild Mango   Where to begin?The server had no grace  just kind of threw the menus on the table and the food we ordered   It happened to be a special burger nite in the area  and two of our party could have gotten the $5 burger  but it wasnt offered   They endedup paying $14 for theirs Boneless wings were waaaay over salted  and they tasted like the chicken was fluffy and had holes in it  like very over processed   The tater tots were crispy outside  gummy inside   None of us finished our meals  and the server didnt notice or care   He stacked our checks and too few pens on the outside of our huge dining table  and we had to ask him to please hand them to us   Wish we had gone to Wild Mango ,negative,370820
